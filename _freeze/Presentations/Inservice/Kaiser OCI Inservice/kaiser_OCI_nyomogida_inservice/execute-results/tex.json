This fluid shift produces a decrease in venous return, ventricular filling, cardiac output, and blood pressure.1 \" @figueroaPreventingTreatingOrthostatic2010\n\n\"This gravity-induced drop in blood pressure, detected by arterial baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, triggers a compensatory reflex tachycardia and vasoconstriction that restores normotension in the upright position. This compensatory mechanism is termed a baroreflex; it is mediated by afferent and efferent autonomic peripheral nerves and is integrated in autonomic centers in the brainstem.2\" @figueroaPreventingTreatingOrthostatic2010 \n\n\"Orthostatic hypotension is the result of baroreflex failure (autonomic failure), endorgan dysfunction, or volume depletion. Injury to any limb of the baroreflex causes neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, although with afferent lesions alone, the hypotension tends to be modest and accompanied by wide fluctuations in blood pressure, including severe hypertension. Drugs can produce orthostatic hypotension by interfering with the autonomic pathways or their target end-organs or by affecting intravascular volume. Brain hypoperfusion, resulting from orthostatic hypotension from any cause, can lead to symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (eg, lightheadedness) and falls, and if the hypotension is severe, to syncope.\" @figueroaPreventingTreatingOrthostatic2010\n\n:::{.callout}\n\n- Jans Ø, Bundgaard-Nielsen M, Solgaard S, Johansson PI, Kehlet H.

If patients are repeatedly tilted up, their orthostatic hypotension is gradually attenuated, presumably by increasing venomotor tone.22\n\n\n### Exercise\n\n\"Physical countermaneuvers involve isometrically contracting the muscles below the waist for about 30 seconds at a time, which reduces venous capacitance, increases total peripheral resistance, and augments venous return to the heart.23,24 These countermeasures can help maintain blood pressure during daily activities and should be considered at the first symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and in situations of orthostatic stress (eg, standing for prolonged periods). Specific techniques include23: •\t Toe-raising •\t Leg-crossing and contraction •\t Thigh muscle co-contraction •\t Bending at the waist •\t Slow marching in place •\t Leg elevation.\" @figueroaPreventingTreatingOrthostatic2010\n\n### Patient Education\n\n\"Education is probably the single most important factor in the proper control of orthostatic hypotension.

Such conditions include prolonged or motionless standing, alcohol ingestion (causing vasodilation), carbohydrate-heavy meals (causing postprandial orthostatic hypotension related to an increase in the splanchnic-mesenteric venous capacitance), early morning orthostatic hypotension related to nocturnal diuresis and arising from bed, physical activity sufficient to cause muscle vasodilation, heat exposure (eg, hot weather or a hot bath or shower) producing skin vessel vasodilation, sudden postural changes, and prolonged recumbency.
