[Supporting organs within the pelvis](#organ-support)\n1. [Bladder & Bowel Control](#bowel-bladder-control)\n1. [Static and Dynamic stabilization of the pelvic girdle, lumbar spine, and torso](#pelvic-girdle-stabilization)\n1. [Sexual function](#sexual-function)\n\n## Supporting Organs {#organ-support}\n\nThe pelvic floor must be able to *contract strongly* and *relax* in order to have proper bowel and bladder continence and elimination @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nThe body expells uring or feces in a process known as **elimination** @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nTo perform elimination, the pelvic floor must be able to *relax* @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n\n\n\n## Bladder & Bowel control {#bowel-bladder-control}\n\n## Pelvic girdle stabilization {#pelvic-girdle-stabilization}\n\nIf the pelvic floor is dysfunctional, it will not effectively perform its function to stabilize the pelvic girdle @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nOver time, this functional pelvic girdle instability can result in issues in the SIJ, lumbar spine, and hips @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nThe pelvic floor muscles work in conjunction with the pulmonary diaphragm to regulate pressure between the thorax and abdomen @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n## Sexual Function {#sexual-function}\n\nThe pelvic floor is important for sexual function, during these activities the pelvic floor muscles contract voluntarily or involuntarily @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nThe pelvic floor is important in sexual function, but oppositely, [sexual abuse can damage and cause it to be dysfunctional](#sexual-abuse) @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n\n\n# Muscle Function\n\nAlthough the pelvic floor can be a mystifying and intimidating region, the muscles are no different than the rest of the body.\nThe muscles must:\n\n- [Contract](#muscle-contraction) @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n- [Relax](#muscle-relax) @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n- [Stretch/Elongate](#muscle-stretch) @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n- [Give feedback](#muscle-feedback) @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n\n\n\n## Contraction {#muscle-contraction}\n\nInability to properly contract the muscles results in inadequate support for the organs, pelvic girlde, urethra, and/or sphincter @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nDuring lifting, the pelvic floor must be able to contract strongly to provide continence @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nWithout this, the patient may experience **incontinence** during heavy lifting or sleeping @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nDuring coughing, sneezing, running, and jumping thelvic floor must make many quick reactions with each impact to prevent urinary incontinence @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n## Relaxation {#muscle-relaxation}\n\nAn inability for the pelvic floor muscles to *relax* can result in *low back pain*, pain during intercourse, inability to completely empty the bladder, and painful trigger points within the pelvic floor musculature @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nPelvic floor relaxation is important during **elimination** of stool and urine as well as giving birth @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n## Stretch {#muscle-stretch}\n\nIf the pelvic floor musculature is unable to *stretch* the patient may experience constipation and digestive issues\n\n# Bladder Physiology\n\n::: {.callout}\n\n- 1.1 Basic Bladder neurophysiology @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n# Layers of the Pelvic Floor {#layers}\n\nThe pelvic floor can be divided into 3 layers of muscles that contract in the sagittal, frontal, and tranverse planes @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n\n1. [Parietalis Fascia](#parietalis-fascia) @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n1. \n1. \n    1. Sometimes the 3rd layer is divided into 2 sublayers, since the deep transverse perineal muscle lies so deep @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n\n## 1 Parietalis Fascia {#parietalis-fascia}\n\nThe first layer of the pelvic floor is known as the *parietalis fascia* (or formally *endopelvic fascia*) @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nThis layer acts as a \"suspensory apparatus\" for the organs in the pelvis @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nThis layer is a complex of smooth muscle fibers, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue which collectively form a \"lining\" @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nThis lining supports and coveres the bladder, intestine, rectum, uterus<sup>&female;</sup>, and prostate<sup>&male;</sup> @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024. \nThe *parietalis fascia* connects the interior pelvis to the lower extremity @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n::: {#tbl-perietalis-fascia-muscles-oian .cell message='false' tbl-cap='Periestalis Fascia Muscles' execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe oian-table\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th>Muscle</th>\n      <th>Origin</th>\n      <th>Insertion</th>\n      <th>Innervation</th>\n      <th>Action</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2 Pelvic diaphragm {#pelvic-diaphragm}\n\n## 3 Urogenital Diaphragm {#urogenital-diaphragm}\n\n\n# Etiology\n\n## Sexual abuse {#sexual-abuse}\n\n\nClients who have experienced sexual abuse often have increased tone in their pelvic floor musculature @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nIncreased tone can result in an *overflow bladder* where urine is constantly dripping @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nThese clients often present with breathing dysfunction @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n::: {.callout title=\"Example\"}\nCarriere noted that a client who had experienced sexual abuse developed a breathing pattern where should would push her pelvic floor inferiorly during exhalation (instead of superiorly) as a defense mechanism @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nOver time this resulted in colon problems @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n:::\n\n\nIt is essential to listen carefully to these patients and that no treatment, specifically internal treatments, will occur until the therapist *and* the client agree that is is necessary @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\nDo **not** sit higher and look down at the client @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n:::\n\n\n# Evaluation of Breathing\n\nBeing able to evaluate and restore *abdominal breathing* is the key to restoring coordination of the abdominal compartment for clients with *PFMD* @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n\n## Normal breathing\n\nDuring inhalation:\n\n- Pulmonary diaphragm moves inferiorly @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n- Abdomen widens @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n- Pelvic floor relaxes and moves slightly downward @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n\nExhalation\n\n- Abdomen flattens @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n- Diaphragm moves superiorly with *minimal* superior movement of the chest @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n- The clavicles should be positioned in an oblique direction from the sternum (superoposterior) which is required for normal breathing @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2002.\n\n\nAssessment\n\n- Place 1 hand on the chest to monitor chest movement\n- 1 hand just below the ribcage to feel rib flare during inhalation and flaring in during exhalation @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n\n\n## Faulty Breathing\n\nThere are a few key markers to observe to assess breathing:\n\n- Neck muscles\n- Loss of Clavicle obliquity\n- Epigastric angle\n- Upper abdomen crease\n\nFaulty breathing can be observed in standing, sitting, or supine @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nDysfunctional breathing can result in a **tight neck muscles** which are not relaxed at rest @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nFor patients who primarily breathe with the accessory muscles in the upper torso will have horizontally oriented clavicles in the frontal plane @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nAs the *accessory muscles of inspiration* pull the chest upward, this is creating a depressive torque on the SCJ resulting in the clavicle depressing into the horizontal plane @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nA very wide epigastric angle &gt;90&deg; @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nA **deep abdominal crease** is also a sign of faulty breathing @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nThis is an evident sign that can be viewed over clothing @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2002.\nThe deep crease is observed just superior to the navel @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2002.\nWhen the patient is in supine, the crease could be up to 3-4 fingers deep @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2002.\n\nUsually caused by [TrA]({{< var ref-transverse-abdominis.path >}}) and internal and [external oblique]({{< var ref-external-oblique.path >}}) weakness @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nTight upper neck muscles and weak trunk muscles are expected @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nClients with these dysfunctions typically have poor posture which should be addressed @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n:::\n\n\n\n<!-- \nWith the client sitting or lying on the back, one can observe and palpate how the breathing movement is only going toward the neck from the crease above the navel. Their breath may not be expanding to the pelvic diaphragm, reaching the pelvic floor. The lungs do not expand downward. I tell my clients that the lungs and heart movements are restricted (in jail and need to be liberated). It may take several treatments to correct such breathing. The clients tell me that they feel liberated when the lungs and heart can move more freely, and the neck muscles are relaxed (Video 3.1 and Video 3.2). Scar tissue in the area between the anus and vagina can make the pelvic floor tissue less pliable and cause a hypertonicity, preventing downward mobility of the pelvic floor. -->\n\n## Reversed breathing\n\n<!-- \nReversed breathing: It is not uncommon to see clients suck the air upward and pull the belly inward while pushing on the pelvic floor during exhalation(Video 3.8). It is not a good idea when organs within the pelvis are pushed downward (Video 3.5). One of my clients was sent with a diagnosis of a prolapse (too long intestine) and scheduled for surgery (Video 3.10). Careful observation solved the problem. At the end of diaphragmatic breathing, the client sucked the belly, like a wave, inward and backward, pushing forcefully onto the colon. When the client learned not to press downward and to exhale with the awareness of relaxation, her colon shortened again, and she did not require surgery. @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024 -->\n\n## Reversed Panting\n\n<!-- \nReversed panting: Just like reversed breathing, clients suck the air in and push down into the pelvic floor facilitating prolapse of inner organs of the pelvis (Video 3.9).@carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2002 -->\n\n<!-- \nObservation of breathing from the beginning to the end.  This assessment is best when the abdomen is not covered  with clothing. It is of utmost importance to restore the  health of the client, not only for the pelvic floor but also for  the heart and lungs and to prevent prolapse of inner  organs. Trunk muscles need to be strengthened, the  mobility of the ribs and the pelvic floor restored, and the  breathing patterns corrected (Video 3.3, Video 3.4, Video  3.5, and Video 3.7). -->\n\n\n\n# Dysfunction\n\n**Pelvic floor muscular dysfunction (PFMD)** is a general term that refers to disorders impacting one or a combination of the [4 functions (supporting organs, B&B, pelvic stabilization, and sexual function)](#function) @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nThis can be caused when:\n\n- Pelvic floor muscles are weak, tight, or torn @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n- Ligaments or fascia are stretched or damage @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is system that cannot effectively transmit loads through the pelvis @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nIn addition, organ support is impaired, resulting in dysfunction in the lower intestines, bowel, bladder, uterus, vagina, and rectum @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n## Direct causes\n\nThe direct causes of PFMD are unknown, but here are events that can contribute to this problem:\n\n- Traumatic injuries @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n- Sexual abuse @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n- Strenuous exercise with *improper* breathing mechanics @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n- Childbirth complications @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n\n\n\n\n\n# Treatment of Breathing Dysfunction {#breathing-treatment}\n\n\n\n# Traditional Exercises\n\n## Kegel Exercises\n\nKegel exercises were invented by Dr. Kegel when he discovered the pelvic floor's ability to contract @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nOriginally, kegel exercises were dosed 300x/day during initial treatments and regressed to 80x/day for maintenance @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nThese exercises, although activating the pelvic floor, were difficult to adhere to for perpetuity and lacked a functional component @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\nIn addition, most clients who were treated with Kegel exercises had limited success @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n# Functional Exercises\n\nWhen attempting to create \"functional\" exercises for our clients, we must consider what makes the pelvic floor functional.\nThe pelvic floor functions in *synergies* with the muscles of the lower extremities, trunk, and movements of the viscera @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nNext we must make decisions based on the patient's goals.\n\nFor a client who must **lift heavy objects**, one should focus on slow-fiber activation over fast-fiber activation @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nFor a client who struggles with **coughing or sneezing**, then the *fast-fibers* should be prioritized @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\nClients who have **difficulty initiating urination**, then breathwork and relaxation would be most beneficial @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024.\n\n\n# Rehab Objectives\n\n1. To achieve sensory awareness of the PFMs @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n1. Restore coordination of the PFMs with the pulmonary diaphragm @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n1. Improve coordination of the pelvic floor with surrounding musculature\n1. Promote muscle function in different planes of movement @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n1. Strengthen fast and slow muscle fibers of the pelvic floor @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n1. Integrate into functional activities @carriereFitnessPelvicFloor2024\n\n",
