Generate forces to maintain postures or move the body\n1. Protect muscle belly and tendon from damage due to excessive tension\n\nMuscle tone is the culmination of mechanisms responding to a stretch to protect the muscle.\n\nThe muscle belly can be broken down into two fibers: the extrafusal fibers and intrafusal fibers.\nThe [extrafusal fibers](#extrafusal-fibers) which we traditionally think of muscle which generate force to move the body.\nThe [intrafusal fibers](#intrafusal-fibers) perform a sensory role to protect the muscle from damage due to overstretching.\n\n\n# Extrafusal fibers\n\nRead more about [extrafusal fibers here]({{< var ref-skeletal-muscle.extrafusal-fiber >}})\n\n# Intrafusal fibers\n\n- Terminal ends: Contractile elements\n- Middle portion: Receptor elements\n\n\nTypes of Intrafusal fibers:\n\n1. Nuclear Chain fibers\n1. Dynamic Nuclear bag fibers\n1. Static nuclear bag fibers\n\nRead more about [intrafusal fibers here]({{< var ref-skeletal-muscle.intrafusal-fiber >}})\n\n# Tone Classification\n\nMuscle tone can be classified in different ways.\nWhen classifying tone based on the physiological process inciting the tone, we can create two classifications: [*Postural tone* and *Phasic tone*](#postural-and-phasic-tone) @gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021.\nwe can also view tone based on the processes by which resistance to stretch occurs: [*active* and *Passive* tone](#active-passive) @gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021.\n\n## Postural & Phasic tone {#postural-phasic}\n\n**Postural tone** is observed in axial muscles where gravity is the most important inciting factor.\nGravity applies a steady stretch on the muscles and tendons, which is countered by a prolonged muscle contraction known as \"postural tone\" @gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021.\n\n**Phasic tone** is what we commonly think of as \"muscle tone\" and is found in the extremities @gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021.\nPhasic tone is observed as a rapid and short duration response resulting from muscle spindle activation following a *rapid* stretch on the tendon and muscle @gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021.\n\n\n\n# Active & Passive Tone {#active-passive}\n\n\n## Active (Contractile) Tone {#active-component}\n\nIncreased tone in the contractile components of the muscle is known as a \"muscle spasm\" @DynamicNeurologicalStabilizationClinicalRehabilitation2014.\n\n\nThe active component is regulated by *spinal* and *supraspinal mechanisms* @gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021.\n\n## Passive (Connective tissue) Tone {#passive-component}\n\n\"The viscoelastic component in turn depends upon multiple factors like the sarcomeric actin-myosin cross-bridges, the viscosity, elasticity, and extensibility of the contractile filaments, filamentous connection of the sarcomeric non-contractile proteins (e.g., desmin, titin), osmotic pressure of the cells, and also on the surrounding connective tissues [3,4]\" @gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021.\n\n\nIncreased tone in the *connective/passive* components is termed \"muscle contracture\" @DynamicNeurologicalStabilizationClinicalRehabilitation2014.\n\n\n# Muscle Stretch Reflex {#muscle-stretch-reflex}\n\n::: {.callout title=\"Anatomy of a Stretch Reflex\"}\nSensory feedback to spinal cord via:\n\n1.

Stretch reflexes were originally thought to be an intrinsic property of muscles. Early in the 20th century, however, Liddell and Sherrington showed that the stretch reflex could be abolished by cutting either the dorsal or ventral root, thus establishing that these reflexes require sensory input from muscle to spinal cord and a return path to muscle (Figure 32–1A).\" @kandelPrinciplesNeuralScience2021\n\n\"We now know that the receptor that senses the change of length is the muscle spindle (Box 32–1) and that the type Ia sensory axon from this receptor makes direct excitatory connections with motor neurons. (The classification of sensory fibers from muscle is discussed in Box 32–2.) The afferent axon also connects to interneurons that inhibit the motor neurons innervating antagonist muscles, an arrangement called reciprocal innervation. This inhibition prevents muscle contractions that might otherwise resist the movements produced by the stretch reflexes.\" @kandelPrinciplesNeuralScience2021\n\n\"Sherrington developed an experimental model for investigating spinal circuitry that is especially valuable in the study of stretch reflexes. He conducted his experiments on cats whose brain stems had been surgically transected at the level of the midbrain, between the superior and inferior colliculi. This is referred to as a decerebrate preparation. The effect of this procedure is to disconnect the rest of the brain from the spinal cord, thus blocking sensations of pain as well as interrupting normal modulation of reflexes by higher brain centers. A decerebrate animal has stereotyped and usually heightened stretch reflexes, making it easier to examine the factors controlling their expression.\" @kandelPrinciplesNeuralScience2021\n\n\"Without control by higher brain centers, descending pathways from the brain stem powerfully facilitate the neuronal circuits involved in the stretch reflexes of extensor muscles. This results in a dramatic increase in tone of the extensor muscle that sometimes can suffice to support the animal in a standing position. In normal animals and humans, owing to the balance between facilitation and inhibition, stretch reflexes are weaker and considerably more variable in strength than those in decerebrate animals.\" @kandelPrinciplesNeuralScience2021\n\n## Monosynaptic pathway\n\n\"The neural circuit responsible for the stretch reflex was one of the first reflex pathways to be examined in detail. The physiological basis of this reflex was examined by measuring the latency of the response in ventral roots to electrical stimulation of dorsal roots. When the Ia sensory axons innervating the muscle spindles were selectively activated, the reflex latency through the spinal cord was less than 1 ms. This demonstrated that the Ia fibers make direct connections on the alpha motor neurons because the delay at a single synapse is typically 0.5 ms to 0.9 ms (Figure 32–3B). In humans, an analog of the monosynaptic stretch reflex, the Hoffmann reflex, may be elicited by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves (Box 32–3).\" @kandelPrinciplesNeuralScience2021\n\n\"The pattern of connections of Ia fibers to motor neurons can be shown directly by intracellular recording. Ia fibers from a given muscle excite not only the motor neurons innervating that same (homonymous) muscle but also the motor neurons innervating other (heteronymous) muscles with a similar mechanical action.\" @kandelPrinciplesNeuralScience2021\n\n\"Lorne Mendell and Elwood Henneman used a computer enhancement technique called spike-triggered averaging to determine the extent to which the action potentials in single Ia fibers are transmitted to a population of spinal motor neurons. They found that individual Ia axons make excitatory synapses with all homonymous motor neurons innervating the medial gastrocnemius of the cat. This widespread divergence effectively amplifies the signals of individual Ia fibers, leading to a strong excitatory drive to the muscle from which they originate (autogenic excitation).\" @kandelPrinciplesNeuralScience2021\n\n\"The Ia axons in reflex pathways also provide excitatory inputs to many of the motor neurons innervating synergist muscles (up to 60% of the motor neurons of some synergists) (Figure 32–1A). Although widespread, these connections are not as strong as the connections to homonymous motor neurons.\" @kandelPrinciplesNeuralScience2021\n\n\"The Ia fibers also send inhibitory signals via the Ia inhibitory interneurons to the alpha motor neurons innervating antagonistic muscles. This disynaptic inhibitory pathway is the basis for reciprocal innervation: When a muscle is stretched, its antagonists relax.\" @kandelPrinciplesNeuralScience2021\n\n\n# Golgi Tendon Stretch

tone), passive movement of a muscle occurs with little or no resistance. Causes include cerebellar damage and pure pyramidal tract damage (a rare occurrence). The hypotonia contributes to the ataxia and intention tremor in cerebellar damage and manifests with minimal weakness and normal or slightly exaggerated reflexes. A pure pyramidal tract injury produces hypotonia and weakness. Hypotonia also occurs when the nerve impulses needed for muscle tone are lost, such as in spinal cord injury or cerebrovascular accident.\" @huetherUnderstandingPathophysiology2020\n\n\"Individuals with hypotonia tire easily or are weak. They may have difficulty rising from a sitting position, sitting down without using arm support, and walking up and down stairs, as well as an inability to stand on their toes. Because of their weakness, accidents during ambulatory and self-care activities are common. The joints become hyperflexible, so persons with hypotonia may be able to assume positions that require extreme joint mobility. The joints may appear loose. The muscle mass atrophies because of decreased input entering the motor unit, and muscles appear flabby and flat. Muscle cells are gradually replaced by connective tissue and fat. Fasciculations may be present in some cases.\" @huetherUnderstandingPathophysiology2020\n\n# Hypertonia\n\n\"four types of hypertonia are spasticity paratonia (gegenhalten), dystonia, and rigidity\" @huetherUnderstandingPathophysiology2020\n\n\"In hypertonia (increased muscle tone), passive movement of a muscle occurs with resistance to stretch and is caused by upper motor neuron damage (see p. 381). The four types of hypertonia are spasticity (usually corticospinal in origin) (Figures 15-12 and 15-13), paratonia (gegenhalten), dystonia (Figure 15-14), and rigidity (usually extrapyramidal in origin). Four types of rigidity are described: plastic or lead-pipe, cogwheel, gamma (independent of stretch reflex pathways), and alpha (dependent on stretch reflex pathways) (see Table 15-16).\" @huetherUnderstandingPathophysiology2020\n\n\"Individuals with hypertonia tire easily or are weak. Passive movement and active movement are affected equally, except in paratonia, in which more active than passive movement is possible. As a result of hypertonia and weakness, accidents occur during ambulatory and self-care activities.\" @huetherUnderstandingPathophysiology2020\n\n\"The muscles may atrophy because of decreased use. However, hypertrophy occasionally occurs as a result of the overstimulation of muscle fibers. Overstimulation occurs when the motor unit reflex arc remains intact and functioning but is not inhibited by higher centers. This causes continual muscle contraction, resulting in enlargement of the muscle mass and the development of firm muscles.\" @huetherUnderstandingPathophysiology2020\n\n# Spinal Shock and muscle tone\n\n\"Spinal shock is the temporary loss of all spinal cord functions below the lesion (below the level of the pons). It is characterized by complete flaccid paralysis, absence of reflexes, and marked disturbances of bowel and bladder function. Hypotension can occur from loss of sympathetic tone at higher levels of spinal cord injury. A major factor in spinal shock is the sudden destruction of the efferent pathways. If destruction occurs more slowly, spinal shock may not develop (see Chapter 16).\" @huetherUnderstandingPathophysiology2020\n\n\"If the pyramidal system is interrupted above the level of the pons, the hand and arm muscles are greatly affected. Paralysis rarely involves all the muscles on one side of the body, even when the hemiplegia results from complete damage to the internal capsule. Bilateral movements, such as those of the eye, jaw, and larynx, as well as those of the trunk, are affected only slightly, if at all. Predominantly the limbs are influenced.\" @huetherUnderstandingPathophysiology2020\n\n\"Paralysis associated with a pyramidal motor syndrome rarely remains flaccid for a prolonged time. After a few days or weeks, a gradual return of spinal reflexes marks the end of spinal shock. Reflexes then become hyperactive, and muscle tone increases significantly, particularly in antigravity muscles. Spasticity is common, although rigidity occasionally occurs (see p. 377). Most often, passive range-ofmotion movements cause “clasp-knife” rigidity, probably by activating the stretch receptors in the muscle spindles and the Golgi tendon organ. (Muscle function is discussed in Chapter 38.) With pyramidal motor syndrome, predominantly the flexors of the arms and the extensors of the legs are affected.\" @huetherUnderstandingPathophysiology2020\n\n# Spasm\n\nA spasm differs from [hypertonia](#hypertonia), a spasm is a reflexive muscle contraction elicited by nociception or other pathological processes @DynamicNeurologicalStabilizationClinicalRehabilitation2014.\n\n# Spasticity {#spasticity}\n\n- [Lateral reticulospinal tract]({{< var ref-lateral-reticulospinal-tract.path >}})\n- [Medial reticulospinal tract]({{< var ref-medial-reticulospinal-tract.path >}})\n\n\n- \"A scissors gait is associated with bilateral injury and spasticity\" @huetherUnderstandingPathophysiology2020\n\n\n\"Motor impairment in humans may result from damage to efferent cerebral cortical fibers passing within the internal capsule. This might happen following a stroke to the blood supply to the internal capsule. The resulting disorder is often termed a pyramidal tract syndrome or upper motor neuron disease, although these names are misnomers. Motor changes characteristic of this disorder include: (1) increased phasic and tonic stretch reflexes (spasticity); (2) weakness, usually of the distal muscles, especially the finger muscles; (3) pathological reflexes, including the sign of Babinski (dorsiflexion of the big toe and fanning of the other toes when the sole of the foot is stroked); and (4) a reduction in superficial reflexes, such as the abdominal and cremasteric reflexes. Of importance is that if only the corticospinal tract is interrupted, as can occur with a lesion of the medullary pyramid, most of these signs are much reduced or absent. In this situation, the most prominent deficits are weakness of the contralateral distal muscles, especially those of the fingers, and a Babinski sign. Spasticity does not occur; instead, muscle tone may actually decrease. Evidently, the presence of spasticity requires the disordered function of other pathways, such as the reticulospinal tracts, as would occur after loss of the descending cortical influence to the brainstem nuclei of origin of these tracts.\" @berneLevyPhysiology2024\n\n## Clasp-knife phenomenon\n\n\"After damage to the descending motor pathways, hyperactive stretch reflexes may result in spasticity, in which there is large resistance to passive rotation of the limbs. In this condition, it may be possible to demonstrate what is called the clasp-knife reflex. When spasticity is present, attempts to rotate a limb about a joint initially meet high resistance. However, if the applied force is increased, there comes a point at which the resistance suddenly dissipates and the limb rotates easily. This change in resistance is caused by reflex inhibition. The group Ib reflex arc suggests that rising activity in this pathway could underlie the sudden release of resistance, and indeed, the clasp-knife reflex was once attributed to the activation of Golgi tendon organs when these receptors were thought to have a high threshold to muscle stretch. However, the tendon organs have since been shown to be activated at very low levels of force and are no longer thought to cause the clasp-knife reflex. It is now thought that this reflex is caused by the activation of other high-threshold muscle receptors that supply the fascia around the muscle. Signals from these receptors cause the activation of interneurons that lead to inhibition of the homonymous motor neurons.\" @berneLevyPhysiology2024\n\n# Rigidity {#rigidity}\n\n- [Long-latency stretch reflexes (LLSR)]({{< var ref-long-latency-stretch-reflex.path >}})\n- Shortening reaction (SR)\n- Stretch-induced inhibition (SII)\n- [Sublaterodorsal nucleus]({{< var ref-sublaterodorsal-nucleus.path >}})\n- [Nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (NRGC)]({{< var ref-nucleus-reticularis-gigantocellularis.path >}})\n- [Locus coeruleus]({{< var ref-locus-coeruleus.path >}})\n- [Caudal raphe nucleus]({{< var ref-caudal-raphe-nucleus.path >}})\n- [Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN)]({{< var ref-pedunculopontine-nucleus.path >}})\n\n# Dystonia {#dystonia}\n\n- [Pallido-thalamo-cortical network]({{< var ref-pallido-thalamo-cortical-network.path >}})\n- [Cerebello-thalamo-cortical network]({{< var ref-cerebello-thalamo-cortical-network.path >}})\n\n# Paratonia {#paratonia}\n\n- [Orbitofrontal damage]({{< var ref-orbitofrontal.damage >}})\n- [Frontal-subcortical dysfunction]({{< var ref-frontal-subcortical.dysfunction >}})\n- [Advanced glycation end products]({{< var ref-advanced-glycation-end-products.path >}})\n\n\n# ALS management\n\n\"Symptomatic Therapy of ALS: Spasticity  Spasticity is an important component of the clinical features of ALS and the feature most amenable to present forms of treatment. Spasticity is defined as an increase in muscle tone characterized by an initial resistance to passive movement of a joint, followed by a sudden relaxation (the so-called clasped-knife phenomenon). Spasticity results from loss of descending inputs to the spinal motor neurons, and the character of the spasticity depends on which nervous system pathways are affected.

Dantrolene acts directly on skeletal muscle fibers, impairing Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is effective in treating spasticity associated with stroke or spinal cord injury and in treating malignant hyperthermia (see Chapter 13).

The basal ganglia also regulate the medial motor pathways, because diseases of the basal ganglia can also affect the posture and tone of proximal muscles.\" @berneLevyPhysiology2024\n\n\"The deficits seen in the various basal ganglia diseases include abnormal movement (dyskinesia), increased muscle tone (cogwheel rigidity), and slowness in initiating movement (bradykinesia). Abnormal movement includes tremor, athetosis, chorea, ballism, and dystonia. The tremor of basal ganglion disease is a 3-Hz “pill-rolling” tremor that occurs when the limb is at rest. Athetosis consists of slow, writhing movement of the distal parts of the limbs, whereas chorea is characterized by rapid, flicking movement of the extremities and facial muscles. Ballism is associated with flailing movement of the limbs (ballistic movement).

The best agent for the symptomatic treatment of spasticity in ALS is baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist (see Figure 16–8). Initial doses of 5 to 10 mg/day are recommended, which can be increased to as much as 200 mg/day, if necessary. Alternatively, baclofen can be delivered directly into the space around the spinal cord using a surgically implanted pump and an intrathecal catheter.

It is approved to treat AUD in France and is indicated for use in patients not responsive to other treatments. There is increased risk of sedation when combining baclofen with alcohol. In a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, baclofen was associated with a delay in return to drinking and a greater likelihood of abstinence, especially in those with higher daily alcohol use at baseline (reviewed in Kranzler and Soyka, 2018).

These drugs are used to treat various neuropsychiatric disorders including epilepsy, Huntington’s disease, addictions, sleep disorders, and more. The GABAA receptors are pentamers of subunits that each contain four transmembrane domains and assemble around a central ion-permeable pore (Figures 16–3 and 16–5), which is selective for Cl– in the case of the GABAA receptor. The major forms of the GABAA receptor contain at least three different types of subunits: α, β, and γ, with a likely stoichiometry of 2α, 2β, 1γ. The IUPHAR/British Pharmacological Society recognizes 19 unique subunits that are known to form 11 native GABAA receptors that can be pharmacologically differentiated. Of interest is that the particular combination of the α and γ subunits can affect the efficacy of benzodiazepine binding and channel modulation. Many drugs, such as benzodiazepines and volatile anesthetics, act as positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor (i.e., act at a site distinct from the GABA binding site to positively modulate the function of the receptor). The high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of the α1β3γ2L GABAA receptor bound to the agonist GABA and the classical benzodiazepines, alprazolam and diazepam, have been solved and utilized to further deduce signaling mechanisms of this group of receptors (Masiulis et al., 2019). Brexanolone is a neuroactive steroid that is a PAM at GABAA receptors and is approved to treat postpartum depression. The interaction of various drugs with the GABAA receptor and their therapeutic uses are presented in Chapter 18.\" @GoodmanGilmanPharmacological2023\n\n\"Some benzodiazepines induce muscle hypotonia without interfering with normal locomotion and can decrease rigidity in patients with cerebral palsy. Clonazepam in nonsedating doses causes muscle relaxation, but diazepam and most other benzodiazepines do not. Tolerance occurs to the muscle relaxant and ataxic effects of these drugs.\" @GoodmanGilmanPharmacological2023\n\n\"however, with diazepam, the effects are secondary to a decrease in left ventricular work and cardiac output. Diazepam increases coronary flow, possibly by an action to increase interstitial concentrations of adenosine, and the accumulation of this cardiodepressant metabolite also may explain the negative inotropic effects of the drug.\" @GoodmanGilmanPharmacological2023\n\n\n\n## Tizanidine\n\n- CNS-Active Agents that controls muscle spasms @GoodmanGilmanPharmacological2023\n- &alpha;-2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine and tizanidine) @GoodmanGilmanPharmacological2023\n- Brand names:\n    - Zanaflex\n    - Sirdalud\n\n::: {.callout}\ntable 79-11 @dipirosDiPirosPharmacotherapyPathophysiologic2023\n:::\n\n\"Tizanidine is an &alpha;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor agonist. It provides effective relief from spasticity due to multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. Although a precise mechanism of action in relieving spasms is not understood, tizanidine is thought to have actions similar to those of clonidine. The advantage of tizanidine over clonidine for this indication is tizanidine’s lesser effect on lowering blood pressure at an effective concentration to relieve spasm. Tizanidine has a short t1/2 and is taken at a dose of 2 mg every 6 h for up to three doses daily; the dosage can be gradually ramped up to a daily maximum of 36 mg. In reverse fashion, the drug must be withdrawn slowly, tapering by 2 to 4 mg daily, to avoid a rebound of spasms, tachycardia, and hypertension. Common side effects include dizziness, sedation, and dry mouth. Use of tizanidine with a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine) can substantially elevate tizanidine’s AUC. Tizanidine can interact additively with CNS depressants; its combination with ethanol should be avoided; antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, and hypotensive agents should be used with caution.\" @GoodmanGilmanPharmacological2023\n\n\"Tizanidine is a muscle relaxant used for the treatment of spasticity associated with cerebral and spinal disorders (see Chapter 13). It is also an α2 agonist with some properties similar to those of clonidine.\" @GoodmanGilmanPharmacological2023\n\n\"Similar to diazepam, tizanidine has both antispasticity and antispasmodic uses and is a centrally acting α2-agonist. Presynaptically, tizanidine inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters that leads to a reduction in postsynaptic activation of the upper motor neuron. In addition, tizanidine leads to the potentiation of glycine. Not surprisingly, because of its α2-agonist activity, hypotension can occur and rebound hypertension seen with abrupt discontinuation. Other significant issues with tizanidine include sedation and elevation in hepatic enzymes requiring periodic monitoring. Tizanidine is metabolized by CYP1A2 and is contraindicated in combination with ciprofloxacin or fluvoxamine.105,107\" @dipirosDiPirosPharmacotherapyPathophysiologic2023\n\n\"Tizanidine is an agonist of α2 adrenergic receptors in the CNS. It reduces muscle spasticity, probably by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. Tizanidine is primarily used in the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis or after stroke, but it also may be effective in patients with ALS. Treatment should be initiated at a low dose of 2 to 4 mg at bedtime and titrated upward gradually. Drowsiness, asthenia, and dizziness may limit the dose that can be administered\" @GoodmanGilmanPharmacological2023\n\n\"Another effective agent for spasticity is tizanidine (Zanaflex), a short-acting, α-adrenergic agonist that acts in the CNS by increasing the presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons.

Dantrolene is indicated for chronic muscle spasticity associated with upper motor neuron disorders (spinal cord injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, or multiple sclerosis). Dantrolene is initiated at 25 mg daily for 7 days and then titrated up every 7 days up to a maximum dose of 400 mg/day. It is also indicated for malignant hyperthermia and used off-label for neuroleptic malignant syndrome. With its peripheral action, it causes generalized weakness. Thus, its use should be reserved to nonambulatory patients with severe spasticity. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with chronic use, requiring frequent liver function tests and use of the lowest possible oral dose.\" @GoodmanGilmanPharmacological2023\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning title=\"Contraindication\"}\n\"Dantrolene, approved in the U.S. for the treatment of muscle spasms, is not used in ALS because it can exacerbate muscular weakness. Dantrolene acts directly on skeletal muscle fibers, impairing Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is effective in treating spasticity associated with stroke or spinal cord injury and in treating malignant hyperthermia (see Chapter 13). Dantrolene may cause hepatotoxicity, so it is important to monitor liver-associated enzymes before and during therapy with the drug.\" @GoodmanGilmanPharmacological2023\n:::\n\n## Botox\n\n\"Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) is effective in alleviating spasticity.33 The amount required to exert a pharmacological effect is often too excessive to use safely in the larger muscles; therefore, its use is best limited to smaller areas of focal muscle spasm.\" @dipirosDiPirosPharmacotherapyPathophysiologic2023\n\n## Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)\n\n- \"&Delta;<sup>9</sup>-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the phytocannabinoid responsible for the characteristic psychoactivity of Cannabi\" @GoodmanGilmanPharmacological2023\n\n\"While the mechanism(s) of action contributing to CBD’s reduction of seizures is unknown, CBD has demonstrated affinity for a diverse array of targets that functionally modulate neuronal excitability.
