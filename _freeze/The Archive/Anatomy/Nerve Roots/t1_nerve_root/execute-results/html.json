Paresis occurs variably in the following muscles: abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis, all lumbricals and interossei, abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi, and adductor pollicis [16]. The finger flexor reflex (C8 T1) may be depressed. Sympathetic fibers destined for the superior cervical ganglia are interrupted, resulting in an ipsilateral Horner syndrome.\" @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022\n\n# Examination\n\n## Muscle Strength\n\n\"Hand Intrinsics (T1) The patient is asked to squeeze the clinicianâ€™s fingers between their fingers while the clinician tries to pull their fingers away (Fig. 25-30). Based on the findings from the history, systems review, and key muscle testing, a sensory examination may be necessary (see Chapter 3).\" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020",
