title: Asterisk Test
---

An asterisk test refers to a movement or technique that recreates the patient's symptoms.
You can use this to test whether or not different therapeutic techniques are improving, worsening, or having no effect on the patient's condition.


It is advisable to find two <i>asterisk tests</i> that serve two purposes.
The first is one that is standardized to your treatment and assists you in your systematic treatment approach.
The second is one that is most applicable and transferrable to the functional activity the patient wants to return to.
