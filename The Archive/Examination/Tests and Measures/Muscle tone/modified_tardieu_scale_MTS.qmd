2 measurements:

1. Quality of muscle reaction
2. Angle of muscle reaction

3 speed definitions:

1. V1 is slow as possible
2. V2 speed of limb falling under gravity
3. V3 moving as fast as possible

::: {#tbl-quality-score}
| Grade | Criteria |
|:-|:----|
| 0 | No resistance throughout the course of the passive movement |
| 1 | Slight resistance throughout the course of the passive movement, followed by release |
| 2 | Clear catch at precise angle, interrupting the passive movement, followed by release |
| 3 | Fatigable clonus &lt;10 seconds when maintaining pressure occurring at precise angle |
|4 | Infatigable clonus &gt;10 seconds when maintaining pressure occurring at precise angle |

| R1 | Angle of muscle reaction at high speed (V3) </br> The angle at which the catch/clonus occurs | |
