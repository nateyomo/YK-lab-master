# Setup

## Subject Conditions

Subject should be tested with flat-heeled shoes OR shoes and socks off.

## Equipment

1. Temper® foam (also called T-foamTM 4 inches thick, medium density T41 firmness rating)
1. chair without arm rests or wheels
1. Incline ramp
1. Stopwatch
1. A box (9” height)
1. 3 meter distance measured out and marked on the floor with tape [from chair]

# Scoring

The test consists of 14 items which can be scored from 0-2 points.
Therefore the test has a minimum score of 0/28 and a maximum score of 28/28.

For each item, “0” indicates the lowest level of function and “2” the highest level of function.

- **Assistive devices**: If a subject must use an assistive device for an item, score that item one category lower.
- **Physical assistance**: If a subject requires physical assistance to perform an item, score “0” for that item.

### 1 Sit-to-stand {#form-sit-to-stand}

Instruction: “Cross your arms across your chest. Try not to use your hands unless you must. Do not let your legs lean
against the back of the chair when you stand. Please stand up now.”


| Score | Level | Criteria |
|-|-|----|
|2| Normal | Comes to stand without use of hands and stabilizes independently |
|1| Moderate | Comes to stand WITH use of hands on first attempt |
|0| Severe| Unable to stand up from chair without assistance, OR needs several attempts with use of hands |

::: {.callout-note}
"Note the initiation of the movement, and the use of the subject’s hands on the seat of the chair, the
thighs, or the thrusting of the arms forward."
:::

### 2 Rise to toes {#form-rise-to-toes}

Instruction: “Place your feet shoulder width apart. Place your hands on your hips. Try to rise as high as you can onto your
toes. I will count out loud to 3 seconds. Try to hold this pose for at least 3 seconds. Look straight ahead. Rise now.”


| Score | Level | Criteria |
|-|-|----|
|2| Normal | Stable for 3s with maximum height |
|1| Moderate | Heels up, but not full range (smaller than when holding hands), OR noticeable instability for 3s |
|0| Severe| <3s |

::: {.callout-note}
"Allow the subject two attempts. Score the best attempt. (If you suspect that subject is using less than full
height, ask the subject to rise up while holding the examiners’ hands.) Make sure the subject looks at a
non-moving target 4-12 feet away"
:::

### 3 Single leg static balance {#form-slb}

Instruction: “Look straight ahead. Keep your hands on your hips. Lift your leg off of the ground behind you without touching or
resting your raised leg upon your other standing leg. Stay standing on one leg as long as you can. Look straight ahead. Lift
now.”


To score each side separately use the trial with the longest time.
To calculate the sub-score and total score use the side [left or right] with the lowest numerical score [i.e. the worse side].


- Left:
    - Trial 1:_____ seconds
    - Trial 2:_____ seconds
- Right:
    - Trial 1:_____ seconds
    - Trial 2:_____ seconds

| Score | Level | Criteria |
|-|-|----|
|2| Normal | 20s |
|1| Moderate | < 20s |
|0| Severe| Unable |


::: {.callout-note}
Include the *best* score from the *worst* side.
:::

"Allow the subject two attempts and record the times. Record the number of seconds the subject can hold
up to a maximum of 20 seconds. Stop timing when the subject moves hands off of hips or puts a foot
down. Make sure the subject looks at a non-moving target 4-12 feet ahead. Repeat on other side."

<details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
You have a patient who scores the following:

| Trial | Right | Left |
|-|-|-|
| Trial 1 | 17s | 19s |
| Trial 2 | 20s| 15s |

When scoring **both** legs, you would report the best score from the two trials:

| Right | Left |
|-|-|
| 20s (2/2) | 19s (1/2) |

When calculating the subscore or the overall score, you cannot include both legs, since each item can only be worth 2 points.
Thus, you must choose the leg with the *worse* score, in this case, it would be the left leg.
You would report this items score as follows:

| Item | Time | Score | Level |
|-|-|-|-|
| Item 3 | 19s | 1/2 pt | Moderate |

Instruction: “Begin walking at your normal speed, when I tell you ‘fast’, walk as fast as you can. When I say ‘slow’, walk very
slowly.”

"Allow the subject to take 3-5 steps at normal speed, and then say “fast”. After 3-5 fast steps, say “slow”.

number of steps from “turn” until the subject is stable. Imbalance may be indicated by wide stance, extra
stepping or trunk motion. "

### 13 Step over obstacles {#form-step-over-obstacles}

Instruction: “Begin walking at your normal speed. When you get to the box, step over it, not around it and keep walking.”

shoeboxes taped together works well to create this apparatus"

### 14 Timed Up & Go with Dual-task {#form-timed-up-and-go-dual-task}

- 3 meter walk
- Instruction TUG: “When I say ‘Go’, stand up from chair, walk at your normal speed across the tape on the floor, turn around,
and come back to sit in the chair.”
Instruction TUG with Dual Task: “Count backwards by threes starting at ___. When I say ‘Go’, stand up from chair, walk at
your normal speed across the tape on the floor, turn around, and come back to sit in the chair. Continue counting backwards
the entire time.”

- TUG: ________seconds;
- Dual Task TUG: ________seconds

| Score | Level | Criteria |
|-|-|----|
|2| Normal | No noticeable change in sitting, standing or walking while backward counting when compared to TUG without Dual Task|
|1| Moderate | Dual Task affects either counting OR walking (>10%) when compared to the TUG without Dual Task|
|0| Severe| Stops counting while walking OR stops walking while counting|

::: {.callout-note}
If the patient's gait speed decreases more than 10% when adding the Dual Task, the score
should be &darr;*decreased* by a point.
:::

"Use the TUG time to determine the effects of dual tasking. The subject should walk a 3 meter distance.
TUG: Have the subject sitting with the subject’s back against the chair. The subject will be timed from the
moment you say “Go” until the subject returns to sitting. Stop timing when the subject’s buttocks hit the
chair bottom and the subject’s back is against the chair. The chair should be firm without arms. TUG
With Dual Task: While sitting determine how fast and accurately the subject can count backwards by
threes starting from a number between 100-90. Then, ask the subject to count from a different number
and after a few numbers say “Go”. Time the subject from the moment you say “Go” until the subject
returns to the sitting position. Score dual task as affecting counting or walking if speed slows (>10%)
from TUG and or new signs of imbalance."
