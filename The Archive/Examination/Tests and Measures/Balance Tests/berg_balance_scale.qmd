title: Berg Balance Scale (BBS)
---



# Indications


In studies on patients with Parkinson's disease @kingComparingMiniBESTestBerg2012, multiple sclerosis @rossCohortStudyComparing2016 and spinal cord injuries @jorgensenComparisonBergBalance2017, the *Mini-BESTest* had a less significant ceiling effect and higher sensitivity in detecting balance improvements compared to other balance scales like the *Berg Balance Scale*.
This means that it is more difficult to reach the max score (ceiling) on the *Mini-BESTest* compared to the *BBS* [@rossCohortStudyComparing2016; @jorgensenComparisonBergBalance2017].

Thus, this test excels at finding balance impairments for *higher* functioning populations than the *Berg Balance Scale*.
