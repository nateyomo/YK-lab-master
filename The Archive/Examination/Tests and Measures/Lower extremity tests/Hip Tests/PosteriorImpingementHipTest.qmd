title: "Posterior Impingement (Hip) Test"
---

<!-- "This test is designed to provoke intra-articular hip pathology (FAI) at the posterior aspect of the acetabulum. The patient is positioned in supine so that both legs hang over the end of the bed in knee flexion. The patient is asked to hold one knee against the chest while the clinician moves the other leg into a combination of maximal hip extension and external rotation. A positive test is associated with pain occurring in the buttock or groin during this maneuver.113" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 -->
