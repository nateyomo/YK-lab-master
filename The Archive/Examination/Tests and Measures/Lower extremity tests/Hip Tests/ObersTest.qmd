<!-- "The Ober test is used extensively to evaluate the flexibility of the TFL (see Thomas test). The patient is placed in the side-lying position, and with the hip extended and abducted and the knee flexed to 90 degrees, the proximal part of the tested leg is released and allowed to drop passively (Fig. 19-49). The test is considered positive when the leg fails to lower. However, there have been some doubts expressed as to the reliability of the Ober test and to date no diagnostic accuracy studies have been performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this test. Flexibility of the gluteus medius muscle and gluteus maximus muscle can be determined using this test by varying the angle of hip and knee flexion to bias the different muscle groups.130 The gluteus medius can be assessed by flexing the knee while maintaining the hip in extension. The gluteus maximus can be assessed by flexing the hip and extending the knee and then asking the patient to roll the upper torso from the side-lying position to the supine position." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 -->



# Modified Obers Test

<!-- "The modified Ober test is performed in the same fashion as the Ober test except that the knee of the tested leg is extended (Fig. 19-50).131 A study by Reese and Bandy131 was performed to determine the intrarater reliability of the Ober test and the modified Ober test for the assessment of TFL flexibility using an inclinometer to measure the hip adduction angle and to determine if a difference existed between the measurements of TFL flexibility between the Ober and the modified Ober test. Sixty-one subjects, with a mean age of 24.2 (SD = 4.3) years, were measured during two measurement sessions over 2 consecutive days.131 During each measurement session, subjects were positioned on their left side and, with an inclinometer at the lateral epicondyle of the femur, hip adduction was measured during the Ober test (knee at 90 degrees of flexion) and the modified Ober test (knee extended).131 If the limb was horizontal, it was considered to be at 0 degrees, if below horizontal (adducted), it was recorded as a positive number, and if above horizontal (abducted), it was recorded as a negative number. The ICC values calculated for the intrarater reliability of the repeated measurement were 0.90 for the Ober test and 0.91 for the modified Ober test.131 Results of the dependent t test indicated a significantly greater ROM of the hip in adduction using the modified Ober test as compared to the Ober test. The study concluded that the use of an inclinometer to measure hip adduction using both the Ober test and the modified Ober test appears to be a reliable method for the measurement of TFL flexibility, and the technique is quite easy to use.131 However, given that the modified Ober test allows significantly greater hip adduction ROM than the Ober test, the two examination procedures should not be used interchangeably as a measurement of TFL flexibility.13" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 -->
