<!-- "In contrast to the provocation tests, this hamstring test was developed to determine safe return to sports for athletes with an acute hamstring strain as a complement to the common clinical examination. Before attempting this test, the patient must demonstrate normal hamstring strength for manual muscle testing, prone at 90, 45, and 0 degrees of knee flexion. The patient is positioned in supine with one leg strapped to the table and with the other leg in a knee extension splint. The leg in the knee extension splint is taken through a ballistic straight leg raise to the maximal ROM while monitoring for apprehension and insecurity. The hip ROM is compared with the uninjured side. In a 2010 study, active flexibility was found to be greater (23%) than passive flexibility. In the athletic population, the injured leg showed smaller (8%) active, but not passive, flexibility than the uninjured leg. Average insecurity estimation using a VAS scale (0–100) was 52 (range 28–98) for the injured and 0 for the uninjured leg, respectively.122 " @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 -->
