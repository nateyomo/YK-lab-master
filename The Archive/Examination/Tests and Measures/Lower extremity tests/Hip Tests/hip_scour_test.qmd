# Technique

![Scour Test @maslowskiDiagnosticValidityHip2010](/The Archive/Examination/Tests and Measures/Lower extremity tests/Hip Tests/images/maslowskiDiagnosticValidityHip2010 fig3 scour test.png)

"The Scour maneuver is performed with the subject supine. The hip is maximally flexed and adducted. Then, with a compressive force applied to the joint in the direction of the shaft of the femur, the examiner moves the femur through a circular arc of motion. The maneuver is considered positive if it recreates pain." @maslowskiDiagnosticValidityHip2010
