":The Stinchfield maneuver is also performed with the subject supine. The tested leg is raised to 30° of hip flexion with the knee in full extension. The subject holds his or her leg in place while the examiner exerts downward force proximal to the knee. The test is considered positive if the maneuver recreates the subject’s pain." @maslowskiDiagnosticValidityHip2010
