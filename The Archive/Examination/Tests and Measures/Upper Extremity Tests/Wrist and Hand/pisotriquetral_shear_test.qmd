title: Pisotriquetral Shear Test
---


"The pisotriquetral shear test assesses the integrity of the pisotriquetral articulation. The clinician stabilizes the wrist with the fingers posterior (dorsal) to the triquetrum and the thumb over the pisiform. The pisiform is rocked back and forth in a medial and lateral direction. A positive test is manifested with pain during this maneuver. No diagnostic accuracy studies have been performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this test." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
