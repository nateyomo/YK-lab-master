title: Scapholunate Shear Test
---


"The patient is positioned in sitting with their forearm supinated. With one hand, the clinician grasps the scaphoid. With the other hand, the clinician grasps the lunate between the thumb and the index finger (Fig. 18-54). The lunate and scaphoid are then sheared in an anterior (palmar) and then posterior (dorsal) direction. Laxity and reproduction of the patientâ€™s pain are positive signs for this test." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
