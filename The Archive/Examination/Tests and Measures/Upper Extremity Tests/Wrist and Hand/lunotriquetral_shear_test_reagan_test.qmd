title: Lunotriquetral shear test (Reagan test)
---

"This test is designed to assess the integrity of the lunotriquetral ligament. The clinician grasps the triquetrum between the thumb and the second finger of one hand and the lunate with the thumb and second finger of the other hand. The lunate is moved posteriorly (dorsally) with the thumb of one hand, while the triquetrum is pushed palmarly in the anteroposterior (AP) plane by the index finger of the other hand (Fig. 18-44). Crepitation, clicks, or discomfort in this area suggests injury to the ligament." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
