title: Pivot Shift Test (Midcarpal)
---

"The patient is positioned in sitting with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees and the forearm pronated. The clinician uses one hand to stabilize the forearm while using the other hand to take the patient’s hand into full radial deviation (Fig. 18-59). The patient’s hand is then taken into full ulnar deviation. A positive test results if the capitate is felt to shift away from the lunate and indicates an injury to the anterior capsule and interosseous ligaments. No diagnostic accuracy studies have been performed to determine the sensitivity and the specificity of this test." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
