title: Gamekeeper's Thumb test (Skier's Thumb test)
---

"The patient is positioned in sitting. The clinician stabilizes the patient’s hand with one hand and takes the patient’s thumb into extension with the other hand. While maintaining the thumb into extension, the clinician applies a valgus stress to the MCP joint of the thumb to stress the UCL (Fig. 18-60). A positive test is present if the valgus movement is greater than 30–35 degrees, indicating a complete tear of the UCL and the accessory collateral ligaments." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
