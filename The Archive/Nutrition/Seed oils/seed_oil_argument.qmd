## Flaxseed oil
Dr. Carvalho cited an SR/Meta analysis by Ren et al. @renEffectFlaxseedIntervention2016, which included 8 articles about flaxseed oil and its relation to the C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker.
Ren et al. @renEffectFlaxseedIntervention2016 concluded that Flaxseed oil has no significant CRP lowering effect @renEffectFlaxseedIntervention2016.

Out of the 8 studies, only two compared flaxseed oil (experimental) to olive oil (control), the other studies compared flaxseed oil to other Omega-6 oils such as safflower, sunflower oil, or soybean oil.
