My first attempt at multivariate analysis was during a research project aimed to determine what factors predict whether a physical therapy patient will 
I initially ran a univariate analysis then only included significant univariate predictors in the final multivariate analysis.

### Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA):
"Used when there are multiple dependent variables and the predictors are categorical. 
Tests whether the means of multiple dependent variables differ across groups."

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

"A dimensionality reduction technique.
Focuses on finding patterns in data and reducing its complexity, not prediction."

### Structural Equation Modeling (SEM):

"Models complex relationships between multiple dependent and independent variables, including latent variables.
Combines aspects of factor analysis and regression."


### Cluster Analysis:

"Groups observations based on similarity without specifying dependent variables.
Used in exploratory data analysis."


### Mixed-Effects Models:

"Extends GLMs to include both fixed and random effects.
Often used for hierarchical or grouped data."


### Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA):

"Examines the relationships between two sets of variables.
Discriminant Analysis:

Predicts group membership based on predictor variables (used for classification)."


### Survival Analysis:

Models time-to-event data.
May use extensions like Cox proportional hazards, which are not always GLMs.
