What does it mean to be an "Evidence Based" clinician?

# Is it nonscientific or Cutting Edge?

Everyone would agree that performing tests or treatments with a complete lack of evidence and logic to support their reasoning is a poor standard of practice.

We also consider the fact that every effective treatment, <i>at one point</i>, had no research.

These two goals seemingly contradict eachother.

Here are some potential ways to use evidence-based without having <i>direct</i> evidence.

- Finding parallels with similar treatment or testing mechanisms
- Using anatomical, biomechanical, or physiological evidence to make educated hypotheses for treatment/testing effectiveness.
