Logistic regression is used when the independent variables are ____ and the dependent variable (outcome) is dichotomous @danielBiostatisticsFoundationAnalysis2019.

A dichotomous variable refers to a variable that is binary and mutually exclusive (e.g. gender, surgery/no surgery, success/failure, live/die) @danielBiostatisticsFoundationAnalysis2019.

Simple linear regression involving two variables:

- $y$ is an arbitrary observed value of the continuous dependent variable
- $\epsilon$ is the difference between observed $y$ and the regression line

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
$$

Logistic Regression

- The observed value of Y is ùúáy|x, the mean of a subpopulation of Y values for a given value of X
- $\epsilon$ is 0 (therefore not included in the formula)
- the difference between the observed Y and the regression line (see Figure 9.2.1) is zero, and we may write Equation 11.4.1 as

$$
\mu_y|x = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
$$
