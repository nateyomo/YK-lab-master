# Bursae

Bursae are fluid-filled sacs between bones and soft tissues [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].
Often, bursa separate tendons from underlying bone [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].
Bursa function to reduce friction to protect tissues that undergo much repetitive movement [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

There are 3 key bursa of the hip according to the APTA [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]
<ul>
    <li>Greater trochanter bursa</li>
    <li>Iliopsoas bursa</li>
    <li>Ischial Bursa</li>
</ul>

::: {.callout-note}
Traditionally, bursa dysfunction is thought to be a cause of hip pain [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

:::

Dutton focuses on 3 greater trochanteric bursae:

1. Subgluteus medius bursa @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
1. Subgluteus maximus bursa @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
1. Superficial subgluteus maximus bursa @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020





# Joint Capsule and Ligaments

- Iliofemoral ligament
- Pubofemoral ligament
- Ischiofemoral ligament
- Ligamentum Teres
- Transverse acetabular ligament

# Acetabular Labrum

The *acetabular labrum* is considered similar to the *glenohumeral labrum* and the *knee menisci* since all are fibrocartilage structures which function to enhance joint stability and increase joint contact @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

## Sensory functions

The outer third of the labrum has nerve-endings to detect nociception and sensory end organs for proprioception @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

## Functions

- Deepens socket by 21% @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 to increase joint stability @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Absorbs 28% of hip joint forces @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 which decreases load on articular cartilage @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Force Distributor  @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Shock absorber @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Improve hip mobility due to its elastic nature compared to a bony rim alternative

# Lumbopelvic Movement

:::{layout-ncol="3"}
### pelvic pronation
lumbopelvic hip complex during ground impact is a combination of 3-D shock-absorbing movements driving the pelvis into an anterior tilt, forward rotation, contralateral drop, and concomitant spinal extension/rotation and relative sacral nutation. Triplanar pelvic motion is analogous to pronation at the foot—an important mechanism for absorbing ground reaction forces6 and a key antecedent for effective propulsion during gait @dischiaviRethinkingDynamicKnee2019
:::

# Biomechanics

## Coxa Vara & Coxa Valga

"As previously described in this chapter, the average angle of inclination of the femoral neck is approximately 125 degrees (see Fig. 12.7A). The angle may be changed as a result of a surgical repair of a fractured hip or the specific design of a prosthetic hip. In addition, a surgical operation known as a coxa vara (or valga) osteotomy intentionally alters a preexisting angle of inclina­ tion. This operation involves cutting a wedge of bone from the proximal femur, thereby changing the orientation of the femoral head to the acetabulum. A goal of this operation is often to improve the congruency of the weight­bearing surfaces of the hip.e" @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017


# Joint Positions

## Pack Positions

There is an <i>Open-pack</i> and <i>Closed-pack</i> position for each joint[@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].
The <i>Open-pack Position</i> refers to when the hip has minimal capsuloligamentous tension and joint congruency[@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

### Open-pack
The Open-pack position for the hip joint occurs at 30&deg; of flexion, 30&deg; of abduction, and slight external rotation in <i>most</i> people [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

which allows maximal accessory joint motion. 

# Kinematics

## Flexion

:::{layout-ncol="2"}
### Osteokinematics

- Active flexion < Passive flexion
- 120 &deg; flexion (when the knee is flexed) @wongPhysicalExaminationHip2022 
- 90 &deg; active flexion knee extended @kapandjiPhysiologyJointsVol2007
- 120+ &deg; active flexion knee flexed @kapandjiPhysiologyJointsVol2007

### Arthrokinematics

- Posterior/inferior glide/spin (According to class)

### Limits

- inferior joint capsule and ischiofemoral ligament (inf fibers), gluteus maximus, soft tissue – thigh to trunk
- When the knee is extended we have passive insufficiency of the hip flexors -> now only have 80-90 degrees of hip flexion
    - passive insufficiency from hamstrings, gracilis

:::

## Extension

:::{layout-ncol="2"}
### Osteokinematics

- 10-20 &deg;
- "0 &deg; of hip extension when knee flexed"

### Arthrokinematics

- Anterior slide & spin (According to class)

### Limits

- anterior joint capsule, capsular ligaments (iliofemoral, ischiofemoral (if IR), pubofemoral)
- Rectus femoris will limit hip flexion more if the knee is extended since the RF crosses both the hip and knee
- Iliofemoral ligament is stressed during hip extension -> will limit hip extension
- Ischifemoral ligament comes from posterior side of capsule and wraps around to the front -> hip extension would pull the fibers down and cause stress -> limits hip extension when the hip is IR

Patients who display a limp are 7x more likely to have a *hip* or *hip and spine* disorder compared to an *isolated spine issue* @aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024.


# Subjective

Before you throw the patient on the table and go to town poking and prodding, take a moment to gather a complete subjective.

Take a moment to listen to:

- The patient's story
- Their description of the 

- List the client's activities and activities of daily living.
    - Frequency
    - Duration
    - Intensity

## History






# Assessment (b proj)

- Observation
- Symptoms
- Subjective

## Observation

- Assessing a client prior to the formal session, is an opportunity to gather the most candid movement and posture analysis.

## Symptoms

Symptoms generally dictate a client's chief complaint.
Symptoms should be used as cues to the condition and are important to address in the plan of care, but should *not* be used to guide the plan of care.

For example, a client could be experiencing trunk pain as the source of their symptoms, but the *cause* and *primary dysfunction* is actually the hip.
In this scenario, hyperfixating on the trunk would be a disservice to this patient, and would require constant symptom management until the *primary dysfunction* is addressed.

## Table assessment

The table assessment should be guided based on a combination of your [observations](#observation) and their [subjective account](#subjective).


### Initial setup

- Patient position: Prone with hips supported and feet supported.
- Clinician: Generally to the side of the patient
- Bend the knee so that you can use the distal lower leg as a lever to assess hip rotation

## Palpation

To assess the hip here is how i usually start:

- Begin at the gluteal insertions around the rim of the ischium and iliac crests.
- move towards the center of the glutes and assess tone
- Move to the greater trochanter and assess hip IR
- assess the tendinous insertions of the Hip's deep stabilizer muscles
- Assess/treat the muscle bellies of the deep stabilizers.

### Adductor palpation

In prone you can palpate [Pectineus]({{< var ref-pectineus.palpation >}}), [Adductor longus]({{< var ref-adductor-longus.palpation >}}), [Adductor brevis]({{< var ref-adductor-brevis.palpation >}}), and [Adductor magnus]({{< var ref-adductor-magnus.palpation >}}).



### Sidelying palpation


- IT Band
- TFL
- Glute max
    - Its transition in the IT Band
- Glute med and glute min
- Assess the lateral roll and inferomedial glide of the femoroacetabular joint.
    - Press under the greater trochanter and into the femoral neck.
    - Normal: Elastic feeling
    - Abnormal: Premature and rigid end feel (no elastic bounce/give)

## Rotation assessment

Hip rotation is a solid starting point for assessing the quality of the hip's range of motion.
This test can assess the quality of both *internal rotation* and *extension*.



## Posterior hip muscle pathways

As you approach the hip in a practical/clinical sense, it will benefit you to group the muscles in terms of *purpose* rather than as individual muscles.

Setup:

- Use your treatment hand to palpate the posterior hip muscles.
- Bend the knee to 90&deg; and keep the thigh supported against the treatment table.
- Your opposite hand is holding the individual's distal lower leg.
- Using your *opposite* hand, rotate the hip from neutral (vertical lower leg) to internal rotation (away from midline) @jonesProjectPhysicalTherapy2025.

Note:

- Hip end feel
- Muscle tension changes

::: {.callout-tip title="Guarding end feel"}
A guarding end feel has **no elasticity**.

When a muscle is guarding, it will abruptly stop since it is protecting the body from a stretch.
Muscle guard release begins at neutral.
As the muscle release progresses, slowly progress the range of internal rotation.
:::



## Iliotibial tract and hip ROM in sidelying

Lateral stability is crucial to weight bearing and linear movements.
The [TFL]({{< var ref-tensor-fascia-latae.path >}}) and [Glute max]({{< var ref-gluteus-maximuspath >}}) co-activate and tense the [IT band]({{< var ref-iliotibial-band.path >}}) to affect lateral stability @jonesProjectPhysicalTherapy2025.

::: {.callout-note}
Laterally leaning into one's [IT band]({{< var ref-iliotibial-band.path >}}) is a common compensation when one lacks activate lateral leg stability @jonesProjectPhysicalTherapy2025.
:::



# Stabilization (b proj)

The ligaments of the femoracetabular joint include the iliofemoral, pubofemoral, and ischiofemoral ligaments.
All of these ligaments are tensioned in extension.

The posterior hip is supported by the deep stabilizers
The anterior hip is supported by the long tendons of the hip flexors



# Gait

- Is the patient using an AD?
    - Is it in the correct hand?
    - Is it fitted to the correct height?
- Hip
    - Limp
    - Trendelenberg / Compensated Trendelenberg
- Knee
- Ankle
    - overpronation
    - Footslap / Foot drop


The *Forward Lunge* with the lead leg on a box or chair is useful to measure knee flexion and hip flexion of the anterior leg and hip extension of the rear leg @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

*Single leg stance* is another test to observe the patient's ability to perform unilateral standing *without* momentum and dynamic components of gait @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020


# Treatment Plan



# Manual therapy

- Manual therapy should be prioritized around the [primary dysfunction](#dysfunction-and-compensation).



## Strain-Counterstrain

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJtINDz7Rc8 >}}

## Prone treatment Categories

- Gluteus maximus (Deep and superficial layers)
- Pelvitrochanteric muscles
- Gluteus medius and gluteus minimus
- Hamstrings, hip adductors, and IT band

# Abduction

Abduction refers to when the leg pivots directly laterally relative to the pelvis @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

ROM of this movement will depend on *pelvic positioning* and *torso control* @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
When measuring ROM, the limit of abduction is when the pelvis begins to move with the leg in question @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

When reaching the abduction ROM limit of one hip, it will typically be followed by activation of the contralateral hip @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
The passive limit of the ipsilateral hip and contralateral activation of the other results in lateral tilting of the pelvis towards the ipsilateral side @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

## Sidelying Activation

- Patient sidelying and facing slightly towards the floor to promote hip abduction/extension
- Body position is the key to isolating the hip and preventing/minimizing compensatory counter movements @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
- Hold end position for 5 seeconds.
    - This prevents the compensations that occur by bouncing between eccentric and concentric phases @jonesProjectFoundations2025.



# Adduction

Adduction of the hips refers to when the leg pivots medially relative to the pelvis @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

::: {.callout-tip}
"Due to opposite leg contact, there is no true adduction range" @jonesProjectFoundations2025
:::

Hip adduction is a *relative* movement, only occurring when moving *from* abduction to neutral @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

Exercises include:

- [Seated wall Hip adduction contract relax](#seated-wall-hip-adduction-contract-relax)



# Dysfunction & Compensation {#dysfunction-and-compensation}

- Primary dysfunction: 
    - The epicenter of the manual therapy battle
    - This is the region will *not* respond to treatment without the necessary time and effort @jonesProjectPhysicalTherapy2025.
- Secondary dysfunction:
    - Regions of the body that are adjusted their role and function due to the primary dysfunction
    - Over time, the secondary dysfunctions will occur until *tertiary compensations* appear @jonesProjectPhysicalTherapy2025.



The trunk's muscle tolerance is generally *much lower* than the leg's muscle guarding @jonesProjectPhysicalTherapy2025.
As a result, the legs will tend to disengage and rely on trunk mobility to achieve a movement.

# Foundational Exercises


- [Seated wall Hip adduction contract relax](#seated-wall-hip-adduction-contract-relax)
    - Adductor stretch
    - Abduction ROM (not true abduction)
- Dead bugs
    - Hip flexor activation


## Hip Adduction / Wall Assist / Hand Resist {#seated-wall-hip-adduction-contract-relax}

"Using a wall to assist in performing hand resistant hip adduction is not a true adduction movement. The adduction is coming from flexion + abduction + rotation position into flexion/adduction/rotation AROM. The goal is to activate hip adduction to release muscle guarding into greater pROM hip abduction range" @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

### Setup

The setup is similar to the *wall sit foundational exercise* but instead of a "V" position of the lower extremity, we employ the "butterfly" position @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

- Sit at the crease of the wall and the floor
- Roll your hips forward (Anterior pelvic tilt) in order to push your glutes as far into the crease as possible
- Activate your abdominals by drawing your naval towards the wall without losing your hip position
- Retract and depress your shoulders
- Look forward (chin tuck) and bring your head backwards (retract) to hold it against the wall
- Bend both knees and externally rotate the hips so that the plantar feet are in contact with eachother at midline.
- Note the starting position of each leg, if they are symmetrical and how much range they hips have in this position.
- Place both hands on the medial surface of each knee
- Apply pressure to create tension on the hip adductors and feel for feedback

Elasticity is a sign of healthy adductor and hips @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
Pain and rigidity is a sign of dysfunction @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

## Rheumatoid Arthritic Hip


- Prevent hip contractures
- AROM in pain-free ROM


## Femoroacetabular impingement

### Pincer impingement {#pincer-impingement}

Occurs when there is excessive coverage of the femoral head by the acetabulum (CEA &gt;44&deg; @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020) resulting in premature contact between the femur and the acetabulum

### CAM Impingement

## Hip Dysplasia


[**Hip Dysplasia**]({{< var ref-hip-dysplasia.path >}}): {{< var ref-hip-dysplasia.definition >}} [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]

While [pincer impingement](#pincer-impingement) occurs from *excessive* coverage of the femoral head by the acetabulum (large CEA), hip dysplasia is the polar opposite and occurs from a *lack* of coverage of the femoral head (CEA &lt; 20&deg;@duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020)

### Presentation

Often patients compensate for insufficient passive stability by maintianing a position of anterior pelvic tilt to maximize femoral head coverage [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

- Look for associated Iliopsoas and rectus femoris muscle tightness [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]

### Treatment


Hip dysplasia is an unstable hip with overly-lax or weakened capsuloligamentous structures [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

As a result, treatment should involve a similar approach to hip instability.


- Protect structures from instability events
- Address impairments
- Optimize function 
- Prevention of OA

- Introduction to swimming as exercise


## Femoral Acetabular Impingement Syndrome (FAIS)

[Femoral Acetabular Impingement Syndrome (FAIS)](): Clinical presentation of hip pain caused by premature contact between femur and acetabulum bones.


### Presentation

- Pain in *C-Sign* distribution
- **Impingement positions**: Repetitive/prolonged hip flexion + adduction + IR
- (+) FADIR
- Younger population
- Functional impairments

### Single Leg Squat

- Decreased depth
- Loss of contralateral pelvic height
- Genu valgum/varus
- Trunk compensations
- Poor lower extremity control

### Star Excursion Balance Test

Limited in *Posterolateral* and *Posteromedial* directions

::: {.callout-tip}
I often use this test since it can be used as a treatment and easily added to the HEP
:::






<!-- ## Syndrome *not* a pathology

FAI is simply an generalized term for the impingement, but your examination should not end with a label of FAI.

You should specify the type of FAI: **CAM femoraoacetabular impingement** or **Pincer FAI**

Rule in our out secondary injuries: **Labral injury** or **chondral damage** -->

<!-- ## Types

- CAM femoroacetabular impingement: FAI caused by excessive bone on the femoral head-neck junction
- Pincer femoroacetabular impingement: Excessive bone growth on the acetabulum, resulting in FAI


- Anatomical vs Functional
  - Functional: Excessive femoral translation and instability resulting in impingement
  - Anatomical: bone growht

 -->

### Treatment

There is limited literature for FAIS treatment

::: {.callout-tip}
Sharing clinical expertise is even more valuable when managing this population!
:::

**Hip Flexor Mobility**: Addressing hip flexor muscle length issues should be prioritized as tightness of these structures can have a postural effect by increasing anterior pelvic tilt.

**Functional training**: Progressing patients towards single-leg closed chain positions and movements


## Hip Microinstability {#hip-microinstability}

[**Hip Microinstability**](): The combined entity of capsuloligamentous laxity *and* clinical symptoms (i.e. pain) with or without apprehension.





### Etiology

In general there is no single traumatic event that causes hip microinstability.
Bony dysplasia *may* be present but is not considered a necessary criterion.

The mechanism is **repetitive microtrauma** generally due to insufficient passive stabilization from the [anterior joint capsule]({{< var ref-femoroacetabular-joint-capsule.path >}}) and [iliofemoral ligament]({{< var ref-iliofemoral-ligament.path >}})



### Presentation

- No hx of trauma
- Aggravation with Weight bearing ER + extension (anterior instability)


- Pain: 
  - Groin or Deep joint pain
  - C-Sign Hip Pain Distribution
- Functional difficulties
  - Particularly in hip extension + ER
- Weak hip abductor and rotator muscles

### Diagnosis

- 3 Test cluster:
  - AB-HEER test 
  - Prone instability test
  - Hyperextension-external rotation (HEER) test
- 3 positive tests was associated with a 95% chance of microinstability.


### DDX

## Adductor Muscle Injuries


Adductor muscle strains are a common injury in sports like hockey and soccer

with the MOI including *acute*, *overuse*, and *acute-on-chronic*


::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Acute Population**

In kicking athletes, such as soccer, the injury is generally acute and occurs when rapidly transitioning between hip extension &rarr; flexion.
:::
::: {.column}
**Overuse Population**

Ice hockey consists of repetitive eccentric loading of the adductors and injuries are generally due to overuse
:::
:::


These injuries generally occur due to hip muscle weakness and lack of off-season conditioning.
When ruling in an adductor strain, look for recent increases in activity



### Most common adductors injured

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
1. Adductor Longus

:::
:::



### Risk Factors

- Previous groin injury (2x risk)
- Lack of off-season sport-specific training
- Hip muscle weakness
  - Adductor to abductor muscle strength ratio &lt;80%
- Lower abdominal muscle weakness
- Decreased hip joint ROM

### Prevention

## Hamstring Injuries


### Presentation

- Common injury in athletes
- Myotendinous junction of Biceps Femoris Long Head
- Pain and tightness in posterior thigh

## Rule out Tendon avulsion

- Proximal posterior thigh pain
- Traumatic onset
- Inability or unwillingness to bear weight
- Visible ecchymosis
- Palpable defects in the hamstring musculature



### Exercises

- Hip flexor and knee extensor strengthening at end range
- Start with isometrics

- C Drill
- Nordic curl


### Preventing Secondary Complications

- Active SLUMP




### H-Test

Using the [H-Test]({{< var ref-h-test.path >}}) is useful to determine apprehension when determining RTS after hamstring injury.
The lower the apprehension, the more confident you can be in returning a patient to sport.

## Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS)

### Definition

[**Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome**]({{< var ref-greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome.path >}}): lateral hip pain that may originate from numerous sources surrounding the greater trochanter [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

- [Gluteus minimus]({{< var ref-gluteus-minimus.tendon >}}) and [medius]({{< var ref-gluteus-medius.tendon >}}) tendons [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]
- Trochanteric bursa [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]
- Proximal ITB [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]


### PathoMechanism

GTPS is theorized to be an overuse injury due to chronic movement dysfunction of **Hip Adduction** and **IR** due to poor eccentric control [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

An attempt to create stability by sitting into passive structures such as IT band and glute tendons

### Population

# Intervention Strategies


# Functional-Phase based POC

There are 2 distinct phases: the [*acute phase*](#acute-phase) and the [*functional phase*](#functional-phase)

## Acute Phase {#acute-phase}

The goals of the acute phase are as follows:

- Protect the injury site from further damage
- Restore pain free ROM
- Maximize patient comfort
  - Decrease pain
  - Decrease Inflammation
- Prevent
  - Muscle atrophy
  - Functional regression
  - Cardiovascular fitness
- HEP independence


Exercises:

- Quadruped position
  - The quadruped position brings the hip into a *closed kinetic chain* position at ~90&deg; hip flexion.
  - Variations:
    - forward/backwards shifts @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

## Functional Phase {#functional-phase}


# Exercises

## Hip flexor

- Thomas hip flexion exercise

## Hip Abduction


### Hip abduction + EXT

@jonesProjectFoundations2025

### Hip abduction + High knee

Adding a *high knee* component allows the linear movement to explore the full range, while holding the leg laterally against gravity @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
