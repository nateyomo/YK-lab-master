title: Musculoskeletal Overview

One of the areas I struggle the most was extrapolating from a constellation of symptoms and body structure functions to activity and participation deficits.


# Posturally leaning into one hip

Generally, most people have a preferred hip they will "sit" into while standing.
In this position the ipsilateral hip is in an adducted position and resting passively against the IT band.
In this position, the glutes are underactive
Here is what you would *expect* to find on the manual examination:

- Hip abductors:
    - 
- Hip deep stabilizers:
    - 
- Adductor group
    - Since the hip is in an adducted position, the adductors are shortened and have difficulty lengthening
- Lateral knee
    - Lateral knee tissues are going to be tensioned
- Ankle
    - Scarring on lateral side due to remaining in inverted position
    - Difficulty returning to an everted position
