- Proximal carpal row:
    - Scaphoid
    - Lunate
    - Triquetrum
- Distal carpal row:
    - Trapezium
    - Trapezoid
    - Capitate
    - Hamate
- Pisiform

::: {.callout-note}
The distal row of carpals form a relatively rigid structure, whereas the proximal carpal row is a mobile structure @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
The proximal carpal row acts a mobile  structure between the rigidity of the radius and ulna proximally and the rigid distal carpal row distally @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

## Scaphoid

![Scaphoid bone (left) @grayAnatomyHumanBody1918](/The Archive/Images/Gray anatomy 1918 images/Osteology/image221 The left navicular bone.gif){#fig-gray1918-image221}

The scaphoid bone Articular surfaces:

- 2 distal convex surfaces to articulate with:
    - The proximal aspect of the trapezium @jonesProjectFoundations2025
    - The medial surface of the trapezoid @jonesProjectFoundations2025
- 1 concave articular facet: to articulate with the capitate


Stabilization

- 1st factor
    - scapho-trapezial ligament
    - Scapho-trapezoidal ligament
    - Scapho-capitate ligament
- 2nd factor
    - Radio-capitate ligament extends from anterior border of the radial styloid process to the anterior aspect of the capitate @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
        - This ligament forms a sling along the anterior aspect of the scaphoid
        - As this ligament is tensioned, it translates the inferior aspect of the scaphoid posteriorly @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
        - This ligament functionally checks anterior tilting of the scaphoid when it "lies down" during flexion @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
- 3rd factor
    - Tendon of FCR runs anterior to the scaphoid as it courses distally to its [distal insertion on the 2nd metacarpal]({{< var ref-flexor-carpi-radialis.insertion >}}) @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

Scaphoid tilting

- When in flexion the scaphoid lies flat:
    - The scaphoid is jammed between the distal trapezium and trapezoid and the proximal radius @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
    - The inferior pole of hte scpahoidslides on the proximal articular surfaces of the trapezoid and trapezium @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
    - While this occurs, the anterior ligaments tension and limit excessive anterior movement @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
    - Simultaneously, the proximal scaphoid is blocked by the posterior border of the radius @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
- When the lateral pillar is stretching
    - The contraction of FCR helps to limit excessive elongation of the pillar @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

## Capitate

- Articulation
    - The convex capitate articulates with the *medial, concave facet* of the scaphoid @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
    - Concave distal surface of lunate articulates with the convex capitate head @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
        - The capitate head forms a central hinge allowing the lunate to:
            - Tilt laterally @jonesProjectFoundations2025
            - Rotate around the long axis @jonesProjectFoundations2025
            - Tilt antero-posteriorly (sagittal plane) @jonesProjectFoundations2025

- Articulation
    - The hamate is mostly in contact with the triquetrum: the concave distal surface of triquetrum articulates with the concave proximal surface of hamate @jonesProjectFoundations2025
    - The hamate has a small articulation with the lunate @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

# Midcarpal Joint

Although the midcarpal joint is made up of many bones, it is best to simplify the hand:

- Each row of carpal bones as a single structure
- Divide the midcarpal joint into a **lateral** and **medial part**
    - **Lateral part**: forms a plane joint between the distal trapezium and trapezoid articulating with the scaphoid @jonesProjectFoundations2025
- **Medial part** forms a *condyloid joint* consisting of the capitate head and hamate forming a convex aspect that articulates with the concave surface formed by the 3 proximal carpal bones @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

## Neutral position {#midcarpal-neutral}

In the midcarpal joint's neutral position, the hand is straight.

In this position, the *scaphoid* and distal surface of the radius are in contact @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
The scaphoid and center proximal surface of the trapezium are in contact @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

- Ligaments
    - The anterior ligaments of radio-scaphoid are neither stretched or relaxed @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
    - Scapho-trapezial ligament are neither stretched or relaxed @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

## Extension {#midcarpal-extension}

As the midcarpal joint moves from [neutral](#midcarpal-neutral) to extended, the distance reduces and the trapezium moves posteriorly @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

- Contact between the articular surfaces of distal radius and the scaphoid @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
    - Specifically the contact on the distal radius moves slightly anterior @jonesProjectFoundations2025
    - Contact point on the proximal scaphoid moves slightly posterior @jonesProjectFoundations2025
- Contact between the trapezium and scaphoid @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
- Anterior ligaments increase tension @jonesProjectFoundations2025

## Flexion {#midcarpal-flexion}

During flexion, the distances between the radius and trapezium also reduces when moving from neutral to flexion @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

- Moving into flexion, the scaphoid lies flat and most of its contact is on the posterior aspect of the radius @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
- During midcarpal flexion, the trapezium slides proximally and anteriorly on the distal scaphoid @jonesProjectFoundations2025.


# Scaphoid-lunate couple {#scaphoid-lunate-couple}


The wrist flexion-extension movement divides into 3 sectors: 

1. first 20&deg; from neutral: The movements ar small, the ligaments are slack, and intraarticular pressure is minimal @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
1. 40&deg; from neutral: the ligaments being to stretch and intraarticular pressure rises 
    - Up to this point, the movements involving the wrist and midcarpal joint have roughly the same range @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
1. 80&deg; from neutral: Ligament tension and intraarticular pressure reaches a maximum @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

::: {.callout-important}
Beyond section 3, the ligaments tear and damage.
These damages may go undetected.
This can lead to instability, fracture, and dislocations @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
The concept that as you increase range at the wrist, you increase the restraint or locking mechanism is important @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
This is an essential concept for understanding how the lunate and scaphoid pillars lock during wrist extension @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

# Special Tests

### Provocation Tests

- [Scapholunate Shear Test]({{< var ref-scapholunate-shear-test.path >}})

### Tendon special tests

- The Integrity of the Central Slip (Extensor Hood Rupture): "The patient flexes the finger to 90 degrees at the PIP joint over the edge of the table. The patient is then asked to extend the PIP joint, while the clinician palpates the middle phalanx (Fig. 18-57). The absence of extension force at the PIP joint and fixed extension at the distal joint indicates complete rupture of the central slip. No diagnostic accuracy" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
