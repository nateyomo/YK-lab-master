The intervertebral discs in the cervical and lumbar regions are thicker anteriorly, which creates a wedge and encourages anterior convexity, resulting in cervical and lumbar lordosis @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

The costocorporeal joint is an articulation between the *IVD* and the *costal demifacets* of vertebral bodies above and below it with the *head* of the corresponding rib @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
