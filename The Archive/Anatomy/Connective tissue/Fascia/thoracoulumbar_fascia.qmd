# Anatomy

The TLF spans from the SP of T12 vertebrae to the PSIS and iliac crest.10 The functions of the TLF are varied

# Function


". The TLF11: ▶ provides muscle attachment for the TrA; ▶ stabilizes the spine against anterior shear and flexion moments; ▶ resists segmental flexion via tension generated by the TrA on the spinous process; ▶ assists in the transmission of extension forces during lifting activities. The posterior ligamentous system has been proposed as a model to explain some of the forces required for lifting."
