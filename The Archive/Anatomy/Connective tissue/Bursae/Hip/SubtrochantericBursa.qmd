# Abduction ISO Test

The *subtrochanteric bursa* can be tested by positioning the patient in *hyper*adduction and performing an isometric abduction contraction @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.

This maximally compresses the *subtrochanteric bursa* and will provoke symptoms if subtrochanteric bursitis is present @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
