        "Since humans spend most of their waking hours fully upright, the SBL is placed under constant load due to postural demand @myersAnatomyTrains2021.\n",
        "As a result, the fascia adapts to these demands by thickening and creating extra-heavy fascial sheets and bands, as exemplified by the plantar fascia, [achilles tendon]({{< var ref-achilles-tendon.path >}}), within the hamstrings, [sacrotuberous lig.]({{< var ref-sacrotuberous-ligament.path >}}), [thoracolumbar fascia]({{< var ref-thoracolumbar-fascia.path >}}), the \"cables\" of the erector spinae muscles, and the [nuchal lig.]({{< var ref-nuchal-ligament.path >}}) @myersAnatomyTrains2021.\n",
