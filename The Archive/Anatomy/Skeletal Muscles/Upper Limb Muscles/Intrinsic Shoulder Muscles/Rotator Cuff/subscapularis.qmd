# Test

- Lift-off Test (Gerber's test)

<!--
- Some researchers suggest that the lift-off test can be positive for pts with biceps tendon injury @gillPhysicalExaminationPartial2007
- Theorizing that attempting to lift the affected arm off the back might provoke pain or weakness secondary to biceps tendon tear @gillPhysicalExaminationPartial2007
--> 

- Bear hug test
- Belly press test (Napolean Test)
    - "performed by having the patient place the affected hand on the abdomen and attempt to move the elbow anteriorly. The test was considered positive if the patient could not move the elbow forward" @gillPhysicalExaminationPartial2007


# Release {#release}

- Patient in supine
- Stand on the patient's ipsilateral side, facing the patient.
- squeeze the patient's forearm with your elbow against your side and hold their arm with your hand.
- With the other hand, palpate the lateral border of the scapula
- Move to the superior 2/3 or halfway up the scapula
- Keep your wrists pronated so your fingertips are against the anterior aspect of the scapula
- Drive medially on the anterior scapula
- Once you have moved far enough medially, IR your shoulder and drive your fingertips perpendicular to the scapula to push into the subscapularis muscle


::: {.callout-note}
Sometimes patients can feel neurological symptoms of pain radiating up to the neck or down to the arm.
This is common due to the relationship of the subscapularis tissue and the nearby neurovasculature

"SUBSCAPULARIS  Location of Tender Point: Along the lateral margin of the scapula on the anterior lateral margin of the subscapularis muscle. Delve under the scapula with your finger.  Anatomical Correlation: As stated.  Direction to Press on Tender Point: Press from anterior lateral to posterior medial.  =Ss  Treatment Position(s): Patient is supine with affected arm and shoulder over the lateral side of the table. Extend shoulder about 30Â° to bring the level of the muscle insertion parallel to the origin on the anterior surface of the scapula. Rotate the humerus internally with slight adduction. In this instance, it will not be possible to monitor the Tender Point during treatment.  i4e]  Frequency of Occurrence: Uncommon to rare.  Clinical Correlation(s): Pain in the posterior shoulder area made worse by abduction or flexion of the shoulder.  Associated Pain Referral Pattern: Pain in the pain pattern  upper arm and wrist.  Alternate Names/Nomenclatures: None.  Explanatory Notes: None." @myersClinicalCounterstrain2012
