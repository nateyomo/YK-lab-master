# Origin {#origin}

This is considered the distal attachment of the SCM @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.

- **Sternal head**: [sternum (manubrium)]({{< var ref-sternum-bone.path >}}) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
- **Clavicular head**: [Clavicle (medial 1/3)]({{< var ref-clavicle-bone.path >}}) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020


# Insertion {#insertion} 

This is considered the proximal attachment of the SCM @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.

- [Mastoid process of the Temporal bone]({{< var ref-temporal-bone.mastoid-process >}}) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
- [Occipital bone (superior nuchal line)]({{< var ref-occipital-bone.path >}}) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020, more specifically the lateral half @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.

# Innervation {#innervation}
[**Motor**: CN XI Accessory n.]({{< var ref-cn11.path >}}) and **Proprioception**: Cervical plexus (C2, C3, C4) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020

# Action {#action}

## Unilateral Contraction

- Ipsilateral sidebend of the cervical spine [@gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020; @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005; @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017]
- Contralateral rotation of the cervical spine [@gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020; @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005; @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017]

## Bilateral Contraction

Bilateral contraction of the SCM results in simultaneous head and upper cervical extension [@gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020; @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017] and cervical flexion of mid-to-lower cervical spine [@neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017; @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005].
This seeming contradiction is explained [below](#sagittal-plane-biomechanics).

When the head is fixed, the SCM can aid in [respiration]({{< var ref-respiration.path >}}) [@gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020; @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005]
The SCM can prevent posterior translation of the head during mastication @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.

# Biomechanics {#biomechanics}

## Sagittal plane contradiction {#sagittal-plane-biomechanics}

The SCM seems to have contradictory actions in the sagittal plane since it performs both

Below ~C3, the SCM crosses *anterior* to the medial-lateral axes of rotation @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
Above C3, the SCM crosses just *posterior* to the medial-lateral axes of rotation @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
As a result, this creates a strong *flexion* torque to the mid and lower cervical spine as well as a slight extension torque to the upper cervical spine @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

## Torque

The lever arm and resulting torque created by the SCM is greatly affected by the posture of the craniocervical region @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

Based on computer modeling... @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017

When the mid-to-lower cervical spine is flexed, the moment arm doubles the resultant torque @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

::: {.callout-note}
This increase in torque with mid-lower cervical flexion plays a major role in the perpetuation and worsening of forward head posture @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Muscle groups
The sternocleidomastoid is part of the [Superficial neck muscle group]({{< var ref-oians.path >}})


# Palpation {#palpation}

Before palpating the SCM, you must first find these landmarks:

1.  Mastoid process
    - Follow the base of the occiput toward its lateral edge
    - The rounded, most lateral prominence is the mastoid process
1. [Clavicle]({{< var ref-clavicle-bone.palpation >}})
1. [Sternoclavicular Joint]({{< var ref-sternoclavicular-joint.palpation >}})
1. [Transverse process of C1]({{< var ref-c1-bone.transverse-process.palpation >}})

::: {.callout-caution}
Palpate the C1 transverse process gently since this area may be quite tender @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
:::

Now we can begin palpating the SCM.

Position the patient in supine @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
Begin at the mastoid process @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
Since the mastoid process is the [insertion](#insertion) of the SCM, you should be able to palpate the thicker proximal part of the muscle @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
Place your index finger on the medial border, your ring (4th) finger on the lateral border, and your middle (3rd) finger on the muscle belly @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
Follow the SCM anterior and inferiorly to its [origin](#origin) on the [manubrium](#origin) and the [clavicle](#origin) @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.

Now that we have found and traced the muscle belly, we need to differentiate between the sternal and clavicular heads of the SCM
The *sternal head* is said to be "thin" and "cord-like" near the origin at the manubrium @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
The *clavicular head* is described as "broad" and "flat" at its origin on the clavicle @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.

Move the head into extension and cervical contralateral rotation to help differentiate between the [sternal head](#sternal-head-pain-pattern) and [clavicular head](#clavicular-head-pain-pattern) @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.

::: {.callout-note}
It should be noted that the SCM and the [upper trapezius]({{< var ref-upper-trapezius.path >}}) share a continuous attachment along the base of the [occiput]({{< var ref-occipital-bone.path >}}).
At the mastoid process, these two muscles split and have a noncontinuous attachment along the superior border of the clavicle @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.

# Pain Patterns

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

The SCM has 2 distinct pain patterns that are attributed to dysfunction related to the sternal head or clavicular head.

### Clavicular head pattern {#clavicular-head-pain-pattern}

- Pain can refer to the frontal area, extend across the forehead to the contralateral side @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
    - These symptoms are more consistent with severe clavicular head dysfunction @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
- Pain deep in ipsilateral ear @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- Symptoms are frontal headache @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- Dizziness @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- Postural imbalance @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005

### Sternal Head {#sternal-head-pain-pattern}

- Pain
    - Cheek @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
    - Temple @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
    - Orbit pain @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
    - The pain can refer across the cheek ,into the maxilla, and over the supraorbital ridge @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
    - Vertex pain with scalp tenderness.
- Dry cough @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- Autonomic phenomena of the eye including tearing and redness @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.

# Etiology

Common causes of SCM dysfunction include:

- Mechanical overload in extension or flexion @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- Chronic rotation to one side @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
    - Truck drivers
    - Factory workers
- Whiplash @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- Compression of the neck @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- Paradoxical breathing @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- Chronic cough @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005

# Assessments

# Satellite Trigger points

When a patient presents with SCM dysfunction and trigger points, it is common to see these muscles to have associated "satellite trigger points":

- Contralateral SCM @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- [Scalenes]({{< var ref-scalene-muscle-group.path >}}) @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
    - [Anterior scalene]({{< var ref-anterior-scalene.path >}})
    - [Middle scalene]({{< var ref-middle-scalene.path >}})
    - [Posterior scalene]({{< var ref-posterior-scalene.path >}})
- [Levator scapulae]({{< var ref-levator-scapulae.path >}}) @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- [Trapezius]({{< var ref-trapezius.path >}}) @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- [Splenius cervicis]({{< var ref-splenius-cervicis.path >}}) @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- [Sternalis]({{< var ref-sternalis.path >}}) @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- [Pectoralis major]({{< var ref-pectoralis-major.path >}}) @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005


# Affected Organ Systems

SCM dysfunction is often associated with respiratory system problems including the eyes, ears, throat, and nasal sinuses @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.

# Associated Zones, Meridians, & Points

According to Finando @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005 Certain zones, meridians, and points are associated with SCM dysfunction:

- Ventral and lateral zones @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- Foot Yang Ming Stomach meridian @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- ST 10, 11, and 12 @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- CO 17 and 18 @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- SJ 16 @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
- SI 16 @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005

# Stretches

Since the sternal and clavicular heads of the SCM can have isolated dysfunction, it is important to understand how to bias each head when stretching.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
The clavicular head can be stretched through head and neck extension coupled with contralateral cervical rotation @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
Based on this, the clavicular head operates more in the sagittal and transverse planes.

:::
:::


::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
The *sternal head* is most stretched through full ipsilateral cervical rotation with cervical flexion @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
In practice, cue a patient to "touch your chin to your shoulder."

# Strengthening


"Isometric against mild forward resistance" exercise @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005

1. Gently place the palm on the forehead
    - Instruct the patient "do not let me move you"
2. Have the patient clasp their hands behind their head just below the crown and have the patient press their neck against the resistance of the hands @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005
