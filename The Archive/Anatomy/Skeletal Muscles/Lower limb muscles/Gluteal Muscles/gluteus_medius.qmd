# Origin {#origin}

Ilium (gluteal surface below the iliac crest between the anterior and posterior gluteal line) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020

# Insertion {#insertion}

Greater trochanter of the femur (lateral surface) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020

# Innervation {#innervation}

The gluteus maximus muscle is innervated by nerve roots [L4]({{< var ref-nerve-root.l4 >}}), [L5]({{< var ref-nerve-root.l5 >}}), and [S1]({{< var ref-nerve-root.s1 >}}), via the [Superior gluteal nerve]({{< var ref-superior-gluteal-nerve.path >}})  @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020



# Action {#action}

- **Entire muscle**: abducts the hip, stabilizes the pelvis in the coronal plane @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
- **Anterior fibers**: flexion and internal rotation @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020 
- **Posterior fibers**: extension and external rotation @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
    - At &ge;60&deg; hip flexion, the *posterior fibers* of the gluteus minimus switch and produce an *internal rotation* torque @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


The Glute med is the "main hip abductor" due to its efficiency and strength.
The Glute med is efficient since it is almost perpendicular to its lever arm @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

The glute med and glute min are both oriented mostly in the frontal plane, but the glute med is a greater abductor since it can produce ~16kg of force, which is more than 3x that of the gluteus minimus @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

The glute med's insertional angle on the greater trochanter varies with degree of hip abduction @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
At neutral, the angle is *not* perpendicular, thus the force generate by the glute med results in a hip abduction moment *and* joint compression which increases articular contact @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

As the hip moves into abduction, the insertional angle becomes more perpendicular, resulting in a greater hip abduction moment and decreased hip joint approximation force @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
This trend continues until the hip reaches 35&deg; abduction, which is exactly perpendicular @jonesProjectFoundations2025.


# Overview


# Tests & Measures

- External Derotation Test (gluteus medius tendinopathy)

# Exercise

A wedge forcing the foot into hyper-dorsiflexion will cause the client to prevent excessive anterior knee translation and force more hip hinge, which will activate the glutes.

- Single leg bridge (with 90&deg; knee flexion and pushing through the hindfoot)
- Wall triple extension
- Bridge (toes up)
- S/L Hip abduction to high knee
