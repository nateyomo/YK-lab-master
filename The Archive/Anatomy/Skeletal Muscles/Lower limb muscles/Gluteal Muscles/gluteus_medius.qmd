# Origin {#origin}

Ilium (gluteal surface below the iliac crest between the anterior and posterior gluteal line) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020

# Insertion {#insertion}

Greater trochanter of the femur (lateral surface) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020

# Innervation {#innervation}

The gluteus maximus muscle is innervated by nerve roots [L4]({{< var ref-nerve-root.l4 >}}), [L5]({{< var ref-nerve-root.l5 >}}), and [S1]({{< var ref-nerve-root.s1 >}}), via the [Superior gluteal nerve]({{< var ref-superior-gluteal-nerve.path >}})  @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020



# Action {#action}

- **Entire muscle**: abducts the hip, stabilizes the pelvis in the coronal plane @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
- **Anterior fibers**: flexion and internal rotation @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020 
- **Posterior fibers**: extension and external rotation @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
    - At &ge;60&deg; hip flexion, the *posterior fibers* of the gluteus minimus switch and produce an *internal rotation* torque @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
    - The posterior fibers also function to stabilize the femoral head in the acetabulum @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.


The Glute med is the "main hip abductor" due to its efficiency and strength.
The Glute med is efficient since it is almost perpendicular to its lever arm @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

The glute med and glute min are both oriented mostly in the frontal plane, but the glute med is a greater abductor since it can produce ~16kg of force, which is more than 3x that of the gluteus minimus @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

The glute med's insertional angle on the greater trochanter varies with degree of hip abduction @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
At neutral, the angle is *not* perpendicular, thus the force generate by the glute med results in a hip abduction moment *and* joint compression which increases articular contact @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

As the hip moves into abduction, the insertional angle becomes more perpendicular, resulting in a greater hip abduction moment and decreased hip joint approximation force @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
This trend continues until the hip reaches 35&deg; abduction, which is exactly perpendicular @jonesProjectFoundations2025.


# Overview


According to Dutton @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020, the *gluteus medius* has been nicknamed "the deltoid of the hip" due to structural and functional parallels between the two muscles.

The deltoid can be divided into anterior deltoid, lateral deltoid, and posterior deltoid @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
The gluteus medius can be divided into anterior portion, middle portion, and posterior portion @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.

Functionally, the anterior deltoid flexes the shoulder and the anterior portion of GluteMed flexes and IRs the hip @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
The *Lateral deltoid* abducts the shoulder and the *middle portion of GluteMed* abduct the hip @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
The *posterior deltoid* extends the shoulder and the *posterior portion of GluteMed* extends and ERs the hip @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.


# Palpation {#palpation}

<ol>
    <li>Position the patient in sidelying [@bielTrailGuideBody2019]</li>
    <li>Much of the glute medius and minimus overlap, but you can isolate the gluteus medius by palpating the most superior part of the iliac crest [@bielTrailGuideBody2019].</li>
    <li>The glute med's proximal origin extends from the PSIS almost to the ASIS [@bielTrailGuideBody2019].</li>
    <li>The fibers of the glute med and min are fanned across the iliac crest then converge distally at the <i>greater trochanter of the femur</i>[@bielTrailGuideBody2019].</li>
    <li>To palpate the [gluteus minimus]({{< var ref-gluteus-minimus.palpation >}}), dive <i>deep</i> to the the gluteus medius</li>
    <li>Having the patient actively abduct the top leg will help confirm that you are palpating the correct muscle [@bielTrailGuideBody2019].</li>
</ol>


# Tests & Measures

- External Derotation Test (gluteus medius tendinopathy)

# Exercise

A wedge forcing the foot into hyper-dorsiflexion will cause the client to prevent excessive anterior knee translation and force more hip hinge, which will activate the glutes.

- Single leg bridge (with 90&deg; knee flexion and pushing through the hindfoot)
- Wall triple extension
- Bridge (toes up)
- S/L Hip abduction to high knee
