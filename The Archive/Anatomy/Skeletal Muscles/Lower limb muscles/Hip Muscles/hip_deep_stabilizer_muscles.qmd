# Manual Therapy

# Stretches

## Flexion, adduction, ER posterior glide stretch

- Patient positioned in supine
- Therapist places the outside hand at the popliteal space, supporting the lower leg with the forearm
- The therapist places the other hand of the knee
- Bring the patient into *Hip Flexion*
- Apply a *posterior glide* of the femoral head on the femoroacetabular joint by applying pressure with your upper sternum to the patient's proximal tibia and knee.
- Bring the patient into *hip adduction* and *flexion* while maintaining the *posterior glide*.

::: {.callout-note}
If the patient complains of symptoms in the anterior hip, this is likely an overactive hip flexor, which has 2 main causes:

1. The femoral head is anteriorly shifting placing pressure on the long hip flexor tendons.
1. The hip flexor, specifically the iliopsoas is overactive.


To correct the femoral head from anterior gliding and placing too much pressure, you can increase the amount of pressure you are applying at the proximal tibia and knee, in order to increase the amount of *posterior glide*.


to correct an overactive hip flexor, we can try *contract-relax* and/or *antagonist activation*.
*Contract-relax* can be achieved by

# Strengthening
There are many philosophies for strengthening the deep hip stabilizers.

Those who consider this muscle group to be "Deep hip external rotators" would extrapolate this concept to base the training around hip external rotation exercises.

::: {.callout title="Examples"}

- Sideplank with hip rotation
- Kick stand deadlift with inferior-contralateral reach
- Hip airplanes

:::

Many find benefit with these exercises, but is it really due to the external rotation element?

An alternative view of these 6 muscles is to view them as "deep hip *stabilizers*".
Instead of performing external rotation, we can see these muscles' function to act as an active limit of femoral head posterior translation.

With that in mind, to strengthen these muscles, we would want to put the hip in an unstable position where the femoral head is translating posteriorly.
This position is best achieved through a closed chain hip hinge.
As the hip hinges into flexion, the acetabular roof rolls and glides anteriorly on the femur, resulting in relative posterior translation of the femoral head.
In addition, the acetabular roof has less bony coverage in the posterior aspect, thus there is more instability.
