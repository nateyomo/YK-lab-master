The iliopsoas is the most powerful hip flexor @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

# Manual muscle tests {#mmt}

The iliopsoas muscle group act as synergists during:

- [Unilateral SCM MMT]({{< var ref-sternocleidomastoid.mmt >}}) @weinstockNeuroKineticTherapyInnovative2010


# Muscle length test (MLT) {#mlt}

# Special Tests

- Positive [FABER Test]({{< var ref-faber-test.path >}}) can indicate an iliopsoas spasm

# Stretches {#stretch}

- [3D hip flexor stretch]({{< var ref-3d-hip-flexor-stretch.path >}})

# Manual Therapy


- Psoas techniques @chaitowModernNeuromuscularTechniques2003


# Abscess

- An iliopsoas abscess can cause fever
- Tested using Iliopsoas length test

# Iliopsoas Complex Injuries (APTA current concepts)

## Activity modification

- Minimize aggravating mechanical and pain symptoms
    - i.e. Repetitive hip flexion and extension

This can lead to substantial activity modifications for athletic populations

---

## Successful activity modification

You must provide alternatives to the activities for the patient to maximize healing and minimize atrophy

- Cardio: Cycling, ellipitcal, or aquatic exercise
- Resistance training:

## ROM

Stretching, STM, trigger point release, and dry needling were all recommended to improve ROM deficits [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]

No time restrictions were given based on acuity of injury.

## Strengthening

- Gradually progress strengthening
- Since the [psoas major]({{< var ref-psoas-major.origin >}}) and [minor]({{< var ref-psoas-minor.origin >}}) originate from the thoracolumbar junction, it is important to monitor lumbopelvic stability during exercises
- Lumbopelvic strengthening and stabilization exercises are important to start early to create a stable foundation for the iliopsoas complex before exercising it
    - supine lumbopelvic stabilization &rarr; CKC lumbopelvic stabilization
- marching in supine &rarr; Seated &rarr; Standing [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]
- Apta recommended resisted hip flexion from 20&deg; extension to 45&deg; flexion 
- Loaded hip flexion with ankle weights, bands, and cables 
    - Standing hip marches have changing torque on the hip, with the most torque at 90&deg; hip flexion
    - Supine SLR exercise will have increased torque at 0&deg; hip flexion with decreasing load as you approach 90&deg;

## RTS

- ballistic speed exercises [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]

Criteria

- Symptoms still reproducible
- substantial strength asymmetries
