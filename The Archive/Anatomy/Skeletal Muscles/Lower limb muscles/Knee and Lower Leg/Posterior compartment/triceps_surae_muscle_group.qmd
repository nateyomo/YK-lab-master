- Since the gastrocnemius is a *biarticular* muscle, its ability to plantarflex is influenced by the knee position.
    - When the knee is extended, the gastrocnemius is lengthened and is more efficient at plantarflexion.
    - When the knee is *flexed* the gastrocnemius is shortened and becomes less efficient while plantarflexing.
- Conversely, the soleus is a monoarticular muscle, so its length-tension curve is only affected by the ankle's position.
