# Origin {#origin}

- Inferior pubic ramus and Ischial ramus @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
    - My professor referred to the inferior pubic ramus and ischial ramus as the origin for the adductor aspect of the adductor magnus
- Ischial tuberosity @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
    - My professors referred to the ischial tuberosity as the hamstring portion

# Insertion {#insertion}

- **Deep part (“fleshy insertion”)**: medial lip of the linea aspera @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
- **Superficial part (“tendinous insertion”)**: Adductor tubercle of the femur @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020

# Innervation {#innervation}

- **Deep (Adductor) Part**: [Obturator N.]({{< var ref-obturator-nerve.path >}}) ([L2]({{< var ref-nerve-root.l2 >}}), [L3]({{< var ref-nerve-root.l3 >}}), [L4]({{< var ref-nerve-root.l4 >}})) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
- **Superficial (Hamstring) Part**: [Tibial N.]({{< var ref-tibial-nerve.path >}}) ([L4]({{< var ref-nerve-root.l4 >}})) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020

# Action {#action}

- **Hip**: Adduction, Extension, and slight flexion (the tendinous insertion is also active in internal rotation) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
- **Pelvic Stabilization**: Coronal and Sagittal planes @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020

# Anatomy

“The anterior	 head	of	the	adductor	magnus has two sets of fibers: horizontal and oblique. The relatively small (and often poorly defined) set of horizontally directed fibers crosses from the inferior pubic ramus to the extreme proximal end of the linea aspera, often called the adductor minimus. The larger obliquely directed fibers run from the ischial ramus to nearly the entire length of the linea aspera, as far distally as the medial supracondylar line. ” @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017

“The posterior	 head	 of	 the	 adductor	 magnus consists of a thick mass of the fibers arising from the region of the pelvis adjacent to the ischial tuberosity. From this posterior attachment, the fibers run vertically and attach as a tendon on the adductor tubercle on the medial side of the distal femur. The posterior head of the adductor magnus is innervated by the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve, as are most of the hamstring muscles. Because location, innervation, and action are similar to those of the hamstring muscles, the posterior head may also be referred to as the extensor	 head of the adductor magnus” @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017

# Overview
“the adductor magnus is the largest of the adductor muscles, accounting for 60% of the total cross ­sectional area of the entire adductor muscle group.222 As a whole, the adductor magnus attaches proximally to the pelvis from two heads: an anterior head from the ischial ramus and a posterior head from the ischial tuberosity. Realize, however, that other anatomic classifications have been suggested” @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017
