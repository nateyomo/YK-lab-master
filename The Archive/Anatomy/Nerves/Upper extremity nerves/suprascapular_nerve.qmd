# Anatomy

# Origin {#origin}
The [suprascapular nerve]({{< var ref-suprascapular-nerve.path >}}) originates from nerve roots {{< var ref-suprascapular-nerve.roots >}} via the [Superior Trunk]({{< var ref-brachial-plexus.superior-trunk >}}) at Erb’s point @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.

## Path

The suprascapular nerve comes off the [Superior Trunk]({{< var ref-brachial-plexus.superior-trunk >}}) and travels inferiorly and laterally posterior to the brachial plexus, parallel to the *omohyoid muscle*, and inferior to the trapezius to the superior edge of the scapula then through the suprascapular notch @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
The suprascapular artery and vein initially run with the suprascapular nerve, but deviate and run superior to the transverse suprascapular ligament over the suprascapular notch @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.

## Termination

- After passing through the notch, the nerve supplies motor innervation to the [supraspinatus muscle]({{< var ref-supraspinatus.path >}}) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020. 
- The nerve also gives off afferent articular branches to the GHJ and ACJ [@gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020; @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020].
- The suprascapular nerve then passes inferiorly to the scapular spine via the spinoglenoid notch to provide motor innervation to the [infraspinatus muscle]({{< var ref-infraspinatus.path >}}) [@gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020; @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020].




# Motor Innervation

- [Infraspinatus]({{< var ref-infraspinatus.path >}})

# Joint innervation

- Suprascapular nerve provides sensory and sympathetic afferent fibers to the GHJ @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Suprascapular nerve provides sensory and sympathetic afferent fibers to the ACJ @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Suprascapular nerve provides sensory and sympathetic afferent fibers to 2/3 of the "shoulder capsule" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

# Cutaneous Innervation

The suprascapular nerve has cutaneous branches, which provide sensation to the proximal $\frac{1}{3}$ of the arm, but their distribution overlaps with that of the supraclavicular and axillary nerves @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020. 

# Examination

- Empty can / Jobe test can be used to determine suprascapular nerve integrity by testing supraspinatus muscle

# Injury

Compression, traction, or laceration can all cause injury to the suprascapular nerve @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.

## Compression Injury
A direct trauma at Erb’s point can cause a compression-type injury @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
Compression neuropathy of the suprascapular nerve commonly occurs at the scapular notch under the transverse scapular ligament or at the spinoglenoid notch @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
Compression at either of these notches occurs through extraneural inflammation, lipoma or cyst development, scarring following distal clavicle resection, or ligament entrapment @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
Ligament entrapment can be caused from an acute trauma resulting from a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH), scapular fracture, or overuse injuries due to repetitive overhead motions @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020. 

:::{.callout-important}
Entrapment of the suprascapular nerve is easily misdiagnosed as rotator cuff tendinitis, RTC tear, or cervical disk disease @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
:::

# Clinical Presentation

Pain due to suprascapular nerve entrapment can radiate to the lateral neck or posterior and lateral aspects of the glenohumeral joint capsule @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020. 


As the suprascapular nerve is a mixed nerve, the patient presentation can include motor and sensory symptoms:

1. A dull, deep ache at the posterior and lateral aspects of the shoulder, which may have a burning quality @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
1. Muscle atrophy and weakness of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
1. Compensatory GHJ changes due to supraspinatus weakness, such as increased scapular elevation during arm elevation @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
    - This may produce impingement-like findings and complicate the diagnosis @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
1. Full external rotation of the G-H joint and passive horizontal adduction are painful @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020


# Intervention

## Conservative

"Conservative intervention includes rest, ice, analgesics, and a series of perineural injections of corticosteroid to help reduce neural inflammation. A home exercise program of scapular pivoter strengthening (see Chapter 16), scapulohumeral coordination exercises (see Chapter 16), and activity-specific training may be indicated" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

## Surgical

"Surgical intervention, involving neurolysis, cyst removal, or the excision of the transverse scapular ligament is indicated if symptoms persist" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
