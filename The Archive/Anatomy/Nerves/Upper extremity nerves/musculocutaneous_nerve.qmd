The musculocutaneous nerve (Fig. 3-10) is the terminal branch of the lateral cord, which in turn is derived from the anterior division of the upper and middle trunks of the fifth through seventh cervical nerve roots.1

# Anatomy

# Origin {#origin}

The [musculocutaneous nerve]({{< var ref-musculocutaneous-nerve.path >}}) arises from the terminal branch of the [lateral cord]({{< var ref-brachial-plexus.lateral-cord >}}) which comes from anterior divisions of the [Superior trunk]({{< var ref-brachial-plexus.superior-trunk >}}) and [middle trunk]({{< var ref-brachial-plexus.middle-trunk >}}) and thus is supplied by nerve roots {{< var ref-musculocutaneous-nerve.roots >}} @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.

# Path

After arising from the [lateral cord]({{< var ref-brachial-plexus.lateral-cord >}}) of the brachial plexus at the level of [coracoid process]({{< var ref-scapula-bone.coracoid-process >}}) and proceeds caudally and laterally @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020. 
As it travels caudally and laterally down the arm, the musculocutaneous nerve gives branches to the coracobrachialis, before penetrating this muscle 3–8 cm below the [coracoid process]({{< var ref-scapula-bone.coracoid-process >}}) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
The nerve then runs through and supplies, the biceps brachii and partially innervates brachialis muscles, before emerging between the biceps brachii and the brachioradialis muscles 2–5 cm above the elbow @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020. 
After emerging between the biceps and brachioradialis (2-5cm above the elbow), the musculocutaneous nerve becomes the Lateral Cutaneous (antebrachial) Nerve of the Forearm which supplies the anterior-lateral aspect of the forearm @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.

# Dysfunction

- Coracobrachialis entrapment @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

# Lesion

- **Muscular impact** Coracobrachialis, biceps brachii, and brachialis
- **Impact**: Weak elbow flexion with forearm supinated @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

# Etiology

## Atraumatic

Cases of atraumatic isolated musculocutaneous neuropathies are rare @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020. 
Reported cases include poor positioning while under anesthesia, neoplastic structures impinging the musculocutaneous nerve, and strenuous upper extremity exercise without apparent underlying disease @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
Some theorize that exercise-related cases are caused by entrapment of the nerve within the coracobrachialis and/or traction between a proximal fixation point at the coracobrachialis and a distal fixation point at the deep fascia at the elbow @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.\
Injury to this nerve can also result from demanding physical work involving shoulder flexion and repetitive elbow flexion with a pronated forearm.35 Although rare, an isolated lesion to the musculocutaneous nerve can result in weakness of the biceps, coracobrachialis, and brachialis (Table 3-3). These muscles help stabilize the elbow and the G-H joint and maintain the static position of the arm.



# Clinical Presentation

The typical clinical presentation includes ▶ reports or evidence of muscle wasting and sensory changes to the lateral side of the forearm; ▶ weakness of the biceps, brachialis, and coracobrachialis; ▶ diminished biceps reflex; ▶ decreased sensation at the lateral forearm; and ▶ positive electromyogram (EMG) study.

# Intervention

## Conservative Intervention

Conservative intervention as recommended by Dutton incldues cessation of aggravating activities and a gradual return to activity with resolution of symptoms @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
