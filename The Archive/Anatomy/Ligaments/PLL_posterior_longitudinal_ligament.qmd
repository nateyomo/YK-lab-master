title: Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL)
---


# Anatomy

- Sacrum to body of C2
- Continuous w tectoral membrane

# Function

- Prevents disk protrusions and restrains flexion of vert column
- Dural mater strongly adhered to PLL at C3 and higher, diminishes lower



# Manual therapy

- IASTM between 
- Cupping
- Fascial pumping (to Lumbar spine and sacrum) @NickPerkinsClinicalInternship
    - place one hand on T/S kyphosis with fingers pointing rostrally
    - Place the other hand on the sacrum with fingers pointing caudally
    - As the patient inhales, assist the spine into flexion and distraction
    - As the patient exhales, hold the position, then slowly decrease the flexion and distraction force
