# Ligamentous instability

<!-- "Damage to the ligaments controlling stability of the column may occur in the absence of evident bony pathology. This is particularly prevalent in inflammatory disease of the upper cervical spine, where rheumatoid arthritis may weaken or destroy the ligaments on which atlanto-axial stability depends (Fig. 46.57). The transverse ligament is stronger than the dens, which therefore usually fractures before the ligament ruptures. The alar ligaments are weaker, and combined head flexion and rotation may avulse one or both alar ligaments; rupture of one side results in an increase of about one-third in the range of rotation to the opposite side. Pathological softening of the transverse and adjacent ligaments or of the lateral atlanto-axial joints results in atlanto-axial subluxation, which may cause spinal cord injury. Ligamentous damage may also occur in spinal injuries (Fig. 46.58), particularly at cervical levels. Damage may also occur as a result of spinal surgery where ligament removal in addition to bone removal (such as partial facet resection) may result in iatrogenic instability." @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021 -->
