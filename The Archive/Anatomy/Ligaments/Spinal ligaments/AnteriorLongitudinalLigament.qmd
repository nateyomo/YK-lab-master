# Anatomy

The Anterior longitudinal ligament spans vertically from the Sacrum to anterior part of C2


The *ALL* spans the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021.

The ALL is thicker and narrower in the thoracic spine, compared to the cervical or lumbar spine @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021.


The most rostral aspect of the *ALL* starts at the basilar bone (C00) and extends to the *anterior tubercles* of C01 @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021.

The *ALL* continues on the anterior aspect of the spine and ends on the anterior aspect of the *sacrum* @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021.

## Attachments

The *ALL* is simply stated to attach to the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies and the sacrum.
Reality is much less clean, the *ALL's longitudinal fibers* attach to the IVDs, vertebral end-plates, and margins of adjacent vertebrae @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021.

The *ALL* fibers blend with the deeper periosteum, perichondrium, and the periphery of the annulus fibrosus @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021.


## Longitudinal Fibers

The ALL can be broken down into layers starting anterior to posterior @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021.

- Superficial Layer @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021
- Intermediate Layer @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021
- Deepest Layer @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021

**Superficial Layer** is more global and extends 3-4 vertebrae @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021.

**Intermediate layer** extends 2-3 vertebrae @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021

**Deepest Layer** extends from 1 vertebrae to the next @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021.


## Lateral Fibers

The *lateral fibers* of the ALL are also known as "short fibres" and connect adjacent vertebrae @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021

# Nomenclature

The ALL can be referred to based on the vertebral body it is covering.
ALL-C01 refers to the aspect of ALL that attaches to the surface of the vertebral body of C01.

The ALL is *not* referred to based on segment (C01-C02) since the space between vertebral bodies is a fraction of the area the vertebral body covers.
On the contrary, tissues that extend span *transverse processes* or *spinous processes* should be referred to based on segment they span since the segment is a large space than the vertebra.


# Function

FXN: Restricts extension @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

# Dysfunction

The ALL is vulnerable to hyperextension trauma @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
