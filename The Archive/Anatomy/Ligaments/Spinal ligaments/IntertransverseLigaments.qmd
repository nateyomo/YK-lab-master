title: Intertransverse Ligaments
---

<!-- "Intertransverse ligaments run between adjacent transverse processes. At cervical levels, they consist of a few, irregular fibres that are largely replaced by intertransverse muscles; in the thoracic region, they are cords intimately blended with adjacent muscles; and in the lumbar region, they are thin and membranous. For the detailed anatomy of the lumbar intertransverse ligaments, see Bogduk (2012)." @standringGraysAnatomyAnatomical2021 -->
