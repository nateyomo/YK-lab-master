title: Supraspinous ligament
---

<!-- The supraspinous ligament (see Fig. 46.54B) is a strong, fibrous cord that connects the tips of spinous processes from C7 to L3 or L4. It is regularly deficient. The most superficial fibres extend over three or four vertebrae, the deeper span two or three, and the deepest connect adjacent spines and are continuous with the interspinous ligament. Most of the ligament is formed by the tendons of muscles with posterior midline attachments, i.e. semispinalis, longissimus, trapezius and latissimus dorsi. Only the most superficial fibres lack any connection with muscle. Below L4, the ligament is replaced by the decussating fibres of latissimus dorsi. -->

# Treatment

## Fascial Pumping
- Fascial pumping (to Lumbar spine and sacrum) @NickPerkinsClinicalInternship
    - place one hand on T/S kyphosis with fingers pointing rostrally
    - Place the other hand on the sacrum with fingers pointing caudally
    - As the patient inhales, assist the spine into flexion and distraction
    - As the patient exhales, hold the position, then slowly decrease the flexion and distraction force


## Fascial Counterstrain
