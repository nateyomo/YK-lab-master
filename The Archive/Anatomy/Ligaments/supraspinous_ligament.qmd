    - place one hand on T/S kyphosis with fingers pointing rostrally
    - Place the other hand on the sacrum with fingers pointing caudally
    - As the patient inhales, assist the spine into flexion and distraction
    - As the patient exhales, hold the position, then slowly decrease the flexion and distraction force
