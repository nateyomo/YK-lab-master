Tubular, synovial-lined ligament that spans the [transverse acetabular ligament]({{< var ref-transverse-acetabular-ligament.path >}}) to the *fovea* of the *femoral head* @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Function

Functions to sheath and guide the *acetabular artery* (a branch of the *obturator artery*)to supply the *femoral head* [@gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020; @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017]. 

This is especially important when provindg blood flow to neonates, but the blood supply from the *acetabular artery* decreases with age @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
By adulthood the *acetabular artery* supplies little to no bloodflow since the majority of the bloodflow to the *head* and *neck* of the femur is through the *medial* and *lateral circumflex arteries* @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


:::{.callout-note}
There are speculations that the *ligamentum teres* may have a mechanical function to stabilize the fetal hip

# Mechanics

According to Atlas of Anatomy by Gilroy @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020, the ligamentum teres has "no *mechanical* function" @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020.
Neumann @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 disagrees and states that the ligamentum teres "undoubtedly provides some functional stability to the hip," @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 but its exact role is unknown.
There are many positions that tension the *ligamentum teres* such as:

- Flexion + Adduction + ER @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017
- Internal rotation @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017
- External rotation @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017
- Flexion + abduction @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017

## Flexion + Abduction

In the flexed and abducted position, the *ligamentum teres* is theorized to act as a sling and support the inferior aspect of the *femoral head* when in a squat-like position @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Sensory Function

The ligamentum teres contains *mechanoreceptors* and may offer an indirect function to stability through improved proprioception @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Dysfunction

*Ligamentum teres* stress or injury can be a source of *intra-articular hip pain* @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
