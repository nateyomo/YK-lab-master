# Anatoy

C1 lacks a dorsal root @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022

# Innervation {#innervation}

This root supplies muscles that provide multiple functions:

- Support the head
- Fix the neck
- Assist in neck flexion
- Assist in extension
- Tilt the head to one side

Specific Muscle innervations

infrahyoid muscles.

# Lesion

Due to the lack of motor root, C1 lesions are characterized purely by motor symptoms @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022.


Clinically, C1 lesions usually result in minor motor difficulties.

"Because there is no dorsal root from C1, lesions of this root result in purely motor symptoms. This root supplies muscles that support the head, fix the neck, assist in neck flexion and extension, and tilt the head to one side. These, include the longus capitis, rectus capitis, obliquus capitis, longissimus capitis and cervicis, multifidi, intertransversarii, rotatores, semispinalis, and infrahyoid muscles. C1 lesions usually result in minor motor difficulties." @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022
