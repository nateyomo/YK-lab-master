# Anatomy

Types of cervical rib:

- Type I: complete cervical rib articulates with the first rib or manubrium of sternum @hooperPart1ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Type II: incomplete cervical ribs with a free end expanded to form a bulbous tip @hooperPart1ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Type III: an incomplete rib that is continued by a fibrous band @hooperPart1ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Type Iv: rib that appears as a short bar of bone with a length of a few millimeters beyond the C7 TP @hooperPart1ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010

# Costal Cartilage

The costal cartilage of the 1st rib is at the anterior aspect of the 1st rib and it articulates with the sternum at the [1st sternocostal joint]({{< var ref-1st-sternocostal-joint.path >}}) @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Elevation {#elevation}

1st rib elevation is a cause of [Thoracic Outlet Syndrome]({{< var ref-thoracic-outlet.syndrome >}}) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

# Hypomobility {#hypomobility}

1st Rib hypomobility or restriction can be caused by:

- 1st rib subluxation at costotransverse joint

Can result in secondary pathologies, such as:

-  Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS)

- Tests:
    - [Cervical Rotation Lateral Flexion]({{< ref-cervical-rotation-lateral-flexion.path >}})
    - [Costoclavicular Test]({{< var ref-tos-costoclavicular-test.path >}})



# Assessment

## Presentation

- Neck and vague ipsilateral upper limb distribution of symptoms (pain and paresthesia) @mastromarchiFirstRibDysfunction2021
    - Especially ulnar nerve distribution

## Aggravations

Functional

- Restricted and aggravating Neck activity @mastromarchiFirstRibDysfunction2021
    - BIL neck rotations @mastromarchiFirstRibDysfunction2021
    - BIL lateral-flexions @mastromarchiFirstRibDysfunction2021
    - BIL combined movements with extension were the main aggravating activities with restricted range of movement @mastromarchiFirstRibDysfunction2021
- Shoulder girdle @mastromarchiFirstRibDysfunction2021
- Respiratory activities @mastromarchiFirstRibDysfunction2021

Assessment



## Onset

Onset was associated with direct traumas, whiplash, shoulder girdle efforts, such as carrying heavy bags or pulling on ipsilateral arm, and shoulder surgery @mastromarchiFirstRibDysfunction2021


# Mobilization {#mobilization}


## Safety

- If pain/paresthesias w/ rib mobs, authors discourage use @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a
- However if associated w a release phenomenon (nerve function regaining), continue doing mobilizations @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a


## Indication

- [Thoracic outlet syndrome]({{< var ref-thoracic-outlet.syndrome >}}) due to costoclavicular space compression @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a

# Release {#release}

I learned this 1st rib technique from Brad Jones @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
It could be considered a *mobilization with movement (MWM)* but I consider it to be more like a release since at the end of the mobilization, I hold the position and wait for the tissues around the 1st rib to release.


- Patient in supine
- Stand on the ipsilateral side facing the patient's feet
- Palpate the patient's ipsilateral clavicle and follow it medially.
- Move posteriorly from the clavicle into the *posterior triangle* of the neck
- Place your fingertips on the 1st rib and scalenes
- Grip the patient's upper arm
- Drive the 1st rib inferiorly while you bring the shoulder into abduction
- When you reach the end feel, hold the inferior glide and the abduction position for a few seconds until it releases.

Dosage: ~2x10
