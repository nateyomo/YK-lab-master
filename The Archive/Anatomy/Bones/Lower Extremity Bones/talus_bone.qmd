title: Talus Bone
---


The lateral talar surface provides an adjusting vertical surface for the fibula as it externally rotates with dorsiflexion and internally rotates with plantarflexion @jonesProjectFoundations2025.

# Palpation

"The talus can be located by moving from the distal aspect of the medial malleolus along a line joining the navicular tuberosity. It can be more easily located by everting and inverting the foot. Eversion causes the talar head to become more prominent while inversion causes the head to be less visible." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 


# Dysfunction


At end range dorsiflexion, the *talar neck* contacts the anterior margin of the tibial surface @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
Forceful dorsiflexion
