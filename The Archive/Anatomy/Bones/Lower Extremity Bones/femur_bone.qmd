# Histology {#histology}

![A frontal plane cross­section of the proximal femur @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017](/The Archive/Anatomy/Bones/Lower Extremity Bones/images/neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 fig12.10 femur compact and cancellous bone.png)

## Compact bone {#compact-bone}

The cortex of the femur contains mostly [compact bone]({{< var ref-compact-bone.path >}}) @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
The [compact bone]({{< var ref-compact-bone.path >}}) tissue is "dense" and "unyielding," and thus can withstand large loads especially shear and torsional forces @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


## Cancellous bone {#cancellous-bone}

[Cancellous bone]({{< var ref-cancellous-bone.path >}}) is a *relatively* porous and spongy bone tissue that is made up of 3D trabecular lattices which span the inside of the femur @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
[Cancellous bone]({{< var ref-cancellous-bone.path >}}) gives the femur its elastic properties, allowing it to repeatedly absorb external forces @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

Due to Wolff's Law, cancellous bone will concentrate along lines of stress, resulting in defined trabecular networks @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
The trabeculae is separated into the *medial trabecular network* and *arcuate trabecular network* @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Osteologic features

## Femoral head

The femoral head can be found just *inferior* to the middle 1/3 of the *inguinal ligament* @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

The femoral head is covered by *articular cartilage* except for the *fova* @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

## Femoral Neck

The length of the femoral neck impacts the efficiency of the [gluteus medius]({{< var ref-gluteus-medius.path >}}) and [glute min]({{< var ref-gluteus-minimus.path >}}) muscles @jonesProjectFoundations2025. 

If there was no femoral neck, the available ROM of the hip would increase *significantly*, but the moment arm of the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus would shorter and thus its torque generation would be significantly less @jonesProjectFoundations2025.


# Load-Absorption

The femur can withstand the high repetitive forces due to walking and other activities via its composition of [compact bone](#compact-bone) and [cancellous bone](#cancellous-bone) @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.



# Angle of Inclination (AoI) {#angle-of-inclination}

The *angle of inclination* refers to the angle between the femoral neck and medial femoral shaft in the frontal plane @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


| Stage of Development | Angle of Inclination |
|-|-|
| Birth | 165-170 &deg; @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 |
|2-8 y/o | Decreases by 2 &deg;/yr @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 |
|Adulthood | 125 &deg; @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 |

| Name | Angle |
|-|-|
| Coxa vara | <125 &deg; @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 |
| Normal | 125 &deg; @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 |
| Coxa Valga | >125 &deg; @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 |

<!-- "The angle of inclination of the proximal femur describes an angle in the frontal plane between the femoral neck and the medial side of the femoral shaft (Fig. 12.7). At birth this angle measures, on average, about 165–170 degrees. Primarily because of muscle activity and loading across the femoral neck during walking, this angulation usually decreases by about 2 degrees per year between 2 and 8 years of age.233 The angle of inclination continues to decrease by varying rates until reaching its normal adulthood value of about 125 degrees.29,176 As depicted by the pair of red dots in Fig. 12.7A, this angulation typically optimizes the align ment of the joint surfaces. A change in the normal angle of inclination is referred to as either coxa vara or coxa valga. Coxa vara (Latin coxa, hip, and vara, to bend inward) describes an angle of inclination markedly less than 125 degrees; coxa valga (Latin valga, to bend outward) describes an angle of inclination markedly greater than about 125 degrees (see Fig. 12.7B–C for angles that may be considered abnormal). Abnormal angles can significantly alter the articula tion between the femoral head and the acetabulum, thereby affect ing hip biomechanics. Severe malalignment may lead to dislocation or stress induced degeneration of the joint. Although variable, persons with cerebral palsy typically possess a coxa valga deformity that well exceeds that depicted in Fig. 12.7C.233 The reduced or abnormal loading across the hips in this population apparently interferes with the gradual decline in the angle of inclination observed in active, ambulatory children with a typically developed neuromuscular system." @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 -->

# Femoral Torsion

*Femoral torsion* refers to the relative twist between the femur's shaft and neck in the transverse plane @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


| Name | Angle |
|-|-|
| Retroversion | <8 &deg; |
| Normal | 8-20 &deg; anteversion |
| Excessive Anteversion | >20 &deg; |

Femoral torsion can be measured via the [Craig's Test]({{< var ref-craigs-test.path >}})

<!-- "Femoral torsion describes the relative rotation (twist) between the bone’s shaft and neck. Typically, as viewed from above, the femoral neck typically projects several degrees anterior to a medial lateral axis through the femoral condyles. Fig. 12.8A depicts a normal anteversion angle of about 15 degrees, although “normal” values reported in the literature vary from 8 to 20 degrees.61,120 In con junction with the normal angle of inclination (described earlier), an approximate 15 degree angle of anteversion affords optimal alignment and joint congruence (see alignment of red dots in Fig. 12.8A)." @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017

"Femoral torsion is considered abnormal if it markedly deviates from 15 degrees. Torsion greatly beyond 15 degrees is called excessive anteversion (see Fig. 12.8B) and torsion significantly less than 15 degrees (i.e., approaching 0 degrees) is called retroversion (see Fig. 12.8C). Because of the natural variability in the amount of femoral torsion across the population, the clinical distinction between what is “normal” and “abnormal” is often unclear and arbitrarily defined. Some authors have suggested that abnormal femoral torsion be based on values that fall at least 1 standard deviation from the mean." @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017

"Typically a healthy infant is born with about 40 degrees of femoral anteversion.66 With continued bone growth, increased weight bearing, and muscle activity, this angle usually reduces (or “de rotates”) to about 15 degrees by 16 years of age. Excessive anteversion that persists into adulthood can increase the likeli hood of hip dislocation, articular incongruence, increased joint contact stress, and increased wear on the articular cartilage or acetabular labrum.61,90 These factors may lead to secondary osteo arthritis of the hip" @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 

"Excessive anteversion in children may be associated with an abnormal gait pattern called “in toeing.” In toeing is a walking pattern with exaggerated posturing of lower limb internal rota tion.38 This gait pattern may be a compensation to guide the excessively anteverted femoral head more directly into the acetabulum (Fig. 12.9). In addition, Arnold and colleagues have shown that the exaggerated internally rotated position during walking serves to increase the moment arm of the important hip abductor muscles—leverage that is reduced with excessive femoral anteversion.14 With this preference to walk with the hip internally rotated, some of the muscles and ligaments crossing the hip might eventually become structurally shortened, limiting the range of external rotation. The gait pattern typically improves with time because of a natural normalization of the anteversion or a combined structural compensation in other parts of the lower extremity, most commonly the tibia.221 No evidence thus far has shown that nonoperative treatment can reduce excessive femoral anteversion." @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017

"Excessive femoral anteversion of 25 to 45 degrees is common in persons with cerebral palsy; in fact, anteversion as high as 60 to 80 degrees has been reported.13,29 In toeing typically persists in children with cerebral palsy who are ambulatory.192 Spasticity or tightness of hip internal rotator and adductor muscles along with excessive pelvic rotation may contribute to the in toeing postur ing.210 In select cases, a femoral de rotational osteotomy may be considered as a way of reducing the excessive internal rotational posturing observed in gait.38" @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017

# Femoral condyles

These two condyles are not identical.

The medial condyle is narrower and projects more anteriorly than the lateral condyle.

## Intertrochanteric Crest {#intertrochanteric-crest}


## Quadrate Tubercle

The quadrate tubercle refers to the distal attachment of the [Quadratus Femoris muscle]({{< var ref-quadratus-femoris.path >}})

## Lesser Trochanter {#lesser-trochanter}

The lesser trochanter projects posterior-medially from the inferior end of the intertrochanteric crest @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
The lesser trochanter serves as the insertion for the Iliopsoas muscle, and is thus indirectly related to hip flexion and vertical L/S stabilization @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.



# Fracture

The majority of femoral fractures occur at the *femoral neck* in elderly individuals with predisposing conditions such as osteoporosis @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020.

*Femoral shaft* fracture can occur, but are less common and require extreme amounts of force, such as a motor vehicle accident @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020.
