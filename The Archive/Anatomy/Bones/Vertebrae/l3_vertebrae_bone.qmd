title: L3 Vertebrae
---


# Mobility

L3 in most cases serves as the peak or apex of the lumbar lordotic curve, and thus has the most mobility.

# Malalignment

Due to the Psoas major's proximal attachment from the anterior aspect of L3, an overactive Psoas major can result in an anterior translation of the vertebrae.
The attachment at L3's transverse process can also result in ipsilateral rotation of that segment.
