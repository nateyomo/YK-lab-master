## C1 Transverse process {#transverse-process-palpation}

To palpate the Transverse process of C1

- Locate the angle of the mandible on the lateral aspect of the jawbone, it should feel "sharp" @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
- Move posteriorly from the *angle of the mandible* and you should feel the bony prominence of the C1 transverse process @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
- C1 TP lies between the *angle of the mandible* and the *mastoid process* @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.

::: {.callout-caution}
Palpate the C1 transverse process gently since this area may be quite tender @finandoTriggerPointTherapy2005.
