# Overview

The acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) is a *gliding/plane joint* that refers to the articulation between the lateral aspect of the clavicle and the [acromion of the scapula]({{< var ref-scapula-bone.acromion >}}) @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Anatomy

The joint consists of:

- 2 bones
    - Acromion of the scapula
    - Lateral aspect of the clavicle
- 1 articular disc (acromioclavicular articular disc)
- ligaments
- muscles


The part of the acromion that accepts the clavicular facet faces *superiorly* and *medially* @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Periarticular connective tissue

The connective tissue of the ACJ includes:

- Acromioclavicular articular disc
- AC Joint capsule
- Ligaments
    - Coracoclavicular
    - Coracoclavicular

## Coracoclavicular ligament

The coracoclavicular ligament provides passive stability to the AC joint @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


This ligament is broken into 2 distinct parts:

1. Coracoclavicular Trapezoid lig.
1. Coracoclavicular Conoid lig.



::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Trapezoid lig.

The trapezoid lig. extends superolaterally from the superior surface of the [coracoid process]({{< var ref-scapula-bone.coracoid-process >}}) to the trapezoid line on the clavicle @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017. 
:::
::: {.column}

### Conoid lig. {#conoid}

The conoid ligament near vertically from the proximal base of the [coracoid process]({{< var ref-scapula-bone.coracoid-process >}}) to the [conoid tubercle on the clavicle]({{< var ref-clavicle-bone.conoid-tubercle >}}) @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
:::
:::

The coracoclavicular lig. is one of the strongest ligaments in the shoulder @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
The coracoclavicular ligaments' near-vertical attachment, suggest that it plays an important role in suspending the scapula and subsequent upper extremity from the clavicle @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


## Superior capsular ligament {#superior-capsular-ligament}

The *superior capsular ligament* is reinforced by the deltoid and trapezius attachments @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.









# Joint cartilage

The articular surfaces of the clavicle and acromion are lined with a layer of fibrocartilage tissue @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Articular disc {#articular-disc}

The fibrocartilaginous articular disc separates the articular surfaces at the ACJ @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
Based on cadaveric dissection, the acromioclavicular articular disc is found "fully complete" in only 10% of cadavers, indicating that this joint is prone to degeneration @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Kinematics


The motions of the ACJ have both proximal and distal functions.
Proximally, the ACJ's motions help to maintain the optimal mobility and alignment of the [scapulothoracic joint]({{< var ref-scapulothoracic-joint.path >}}) @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

Distally, the ACJ orients the scapula to optimize the articulation of the glenohumeral joint @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


The ACJ's motions are described based on scapular movement relative to the clavicle @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

The ACJ is a triaxial joint with 3 degrees of freedom:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Primary motions

- **Frontal plane**: [Upward](#upward-rotation) & [downward rotation](#downward-rotation) @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017

:::
::: {.column}
### Secondary motions

- **Sagittal plane**: Anterior & Posterior tilting
- **Transverse plane**: 

:::
:::








Since the joint surfaces of the clavicle and scapula are so flat, the concave-convex rules do not apply to this joint @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

## Posterior Rotation

Coracoclavicular (Conoid and Trapezoid) helps posterior rotation


Coracoacromial ligament makes up the roof of the GHJ

## Upward rotation {#upward-rotation}

Upward rotation refers to when the scapula moves upward and outward in the frontal plane relative to the clavicle @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
The ACJ can have up to 30&deg; of upward rotation @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

Upward rotation is important during full shoulder abduction or flexion @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
This motion is an important factor in scapulohumeral rhythm and scapulothoracic mobility @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.



## Downward rotation {#downward-rotation}

*Downward rotation* of the ACJ refers to the motion of returning the scapula from upward rotation back to neutral @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
Downward rotation is associated with shoulder adduction or extension @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

## Anterior Tilt {#anterior-tilt}

ACJ *anterior tilt* refers to the anterior horizontal movement of the glenoid fossa in the sagittal plane @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

Anterior tilt is an important component in full shoulder flexion.



## Posterior Tilt {#posterior-tilt}

ACJ *posterior tilt* refers to the posterior horizontal movement of the glenoid fossa in the sagittal plane @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

Posterior tilt is best appreciated during full shoulder extension.


## Internal Rotation {#ir}

*Internal rotation* (IR) is a secondary motion of the ACJ that refers to the rotation of the *glenoid fossa* in the transverse plane @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
ACJ IR is considered a "secondary motion" since it functions to maintain scapular alignment with the thorax @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


ACJ IR is important during full protraction and horizontal adduction.


## External Rotation {#er}

ACJ *external rotation* (IR) is a secondary motion of the ACJ that refers to the rotation of the *glenoid fossa* away from midline in the transverse plane @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
ACJ ER is considered a "secondary motion" since it functions to maintain scapular alignment with the thorax @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


ACJ ER is important during full retraction and horizontal abduction.


# Innervation {#innervation}

[Suprascapular nerve]({{< var ref-suprascapular-nerve.path >}}) provides sensory and sympathetic afferent fibers to the ACJ @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

# Dysfunction

AC joint injuries are a common shoulder injury in contact sports @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
Most ACJ injuries are [partial strains](#partial-strain), but [dislocations](#dislocation) can occur at this joint as well @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Partial strain {#partial-strain}
# Dislocation {#dislocation}

The ACJ is susceptible to dislocation due to the sloped orientation of the articular facets as well as the likelihood of receiving shear forces through the UE @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


For example, if one were to fall and strike the superior aspect of the shoulder, this can result in an inferior and medial translation of the acromion on the clavicle @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

The superior and inferior capsular ligaments act as the 1st line of defense in preventing the acromion from dislocating inferomedially @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
If the translation is severe enough, the [coracoclavicular ligament](#coracoclavicular-ligament) can secondary resistance to horizontal shear @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


If the shear force exceeds the strength of the active and passive stabilizers, this can result in muscle strain, ligament ruptuer, and dislocation of the ACJ @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Osteoarthritis

Chronic trauma to the ACJ and its CT may result in instability and compensatory movement and postural patterns of the scapulothoracic joint @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
These patterns may result in *posttraumatic ACJ osteoarthritis* @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


# Mobilizations

## Anterior glide

An *anterior glide* mobilization of the ACJ is indicated for patients with limited mobility of the ACJ @kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018.

### Technique

- Place the patient in sitting or prone
- Stand behind the patient
- Wrap your lateral hand around the acromion process to stabilize the scapula @kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018.
- Patient Position Sitting or prone
- Place the thumb of your medial hand on the posterior distal clavicle. You may have to push through the *upper trapezius* muscle @kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018.
- Apply the mobilizing force with your thumb by pushing the clavicle anteriorly relative to the acromion @kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018.

::: {.callout-tip}
If the patient is in prone, you can stabilize the acromion by placing a towel under the ipsilateral shoulder @kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018.

# Exercises

- Low-high cable row with deep squat inhale
    - This is a good exercise for working on ACJ mobility since the cables will pull your shoulders into forward into ACJ IR
    - At the bottom of the squat, focusing on a large inhale will expand the lungs and the back of the thorax, requiring even more ACJ IR
