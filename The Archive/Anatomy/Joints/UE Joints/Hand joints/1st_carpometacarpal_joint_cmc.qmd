To remember this, I like to think about the fact that all of the finger joints are concave on convex when moving in open kinetic chain.
Thus, it helps me to remember that the thumb's saddle joint is concave-on-convex when moving into flexion and extension.
Since it is a saddle joint, I know that the other plane (abduction/adduction) must be convex-on-concave,
