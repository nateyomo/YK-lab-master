title: Femoroacetabular Joint (Hip Joint)
---

# Anatomy

The femoroacetabular joint AKA the "hip joint" is a "classic" [ball-and-socket joint]({{< var ref-ball-and-socket-joint.path >}}) where the "ball" is the femoral head which sits in the acetabulum (socket) @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

## Acetabulum
Acetabulum forms the socket aspect of hip, and its name originates from latin meaning "vinegar cup" @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
The acetabulum forms a partial circle with an inferior opening of 60-70&deg; wide @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

:::{.callout-note}
This circle is completed by the *transverse acetabular ligament* @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

## Contact

The femoral head generally contacts the *acetabulum* along the articular cartilage lined *lunate surface* @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Gait

During gait the hip experiences forces ranging from 13%BW in midswing to >300% BW at midstance @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

# Force absorption

Force absorption at the hip joint occur through a combination of passive structures including the articular cartilage and cancellous bone of the proximal femur in conjunction with active shock absorption through eccentric muscle activation @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

When experiencing high amounts of force, such as midstance in gait, the acetabulum can deform and widen to increase contact area and decrease pressure on the joint @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

:::{.callout-note}
This widening of the acetabulum decreases pressure ($\frac{\textrm{force}}{\textrm{area}}$) and can potentially decrease *peak force* but does not change total force experienced at the joint

# Angle of Torsion

The angle of torsion refers to the angle in the Transverse plane of the twist from the head and neck of femur to the femoral shaft

## Normal

- Infant: 40&deg;
- Adult: 8-15&deg;

## Anteversion

- />15&deg;
- Common w CP
- Can lead to hip dislocation
- Can lead to OA
In toe to improve alignment so that there is greater moment arm of abductors and stability, but this lengthens hip ERs , and shortens IRs

Excessive anteversion

- MR>LR
- Compensations: lateral tibial torsion
- Tibiofemoral ER
- Tends to W sit (stable position) 
- Butterfly uncomfy

## Retroversion

- <8&deg;
- Toe out

Excessive Retroversion

- Femoral LR
- HIP prom LR>MR
- Compensations: medial tibial torsion, tibiofemoral MR

## Examination

Femoral Torsion can be measured using the following test(s):

- [Craig's Test]({{< var ref-craigs-test.path >}})
- Functional squat (neutral, IR, ER)


# Stabilization

- Active stabilization
- Passive stabilization
- Mechanical seal resists first 1-2mm of joint distraction @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 

## Mechanical seal {#mechanical-seal}

The "mechanical seal" or "suction seal" refers to the intra-articular pressure within the synovial capsule of the femoroacetabular joint @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

Formed by:

1. [Acetabular labrum](#acetabular-labrum)

This mechanical seal resists the first 1-2 mm of joint distraction @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017

# Center Edge Angle

Center edge angle refers to the extent to which acetabulum covers femoral head @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017. 

Normal values:

- Adults: 35-40&deg;
    - If larger: more likely to develop hip impingement

A low (25-35&deg;) CE angle indicates that there is reduced acetabular coverage of the *femoral head* which places the individual at greater risk of dislocation and decreases contact surfaces within the joint @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
Decreased contact surfaces will increase the amount of pressure the contact surfaces experience for the same amount of force @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

## Pincer Impingement

- inc center edge angle, too much coverage of acetabulum, labrum can be crushed

## CAM impingement

- Thickened bone at intersection of head/neck 
- Can cause impingement of labrum
- If smaller: more likely to dislocate

# Acetabular anteversion

- Extent to which acetabulum surrounds femoral head
- Normal: 20
- />20 = dislocation
- <20 = inc stability


# Capsular pattern

1. IR
2. Flexion
3. Abduction


# Ligaments & Capsule


- Iliofemoral: 
    - Strongest @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
    - Limits Ext and ER
- Pubofemoral lig. @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
    - Limits abd and ext, less er
- Ischiofemoral lig. @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
    - Limits IR and Ext

- Zona orbicularis (Anular ligament)


# Joint Capsule

The joint capsule is weakest in the *gaps* between joint ligaments @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020.

![Fig 31.9 @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020]()

There is a gap between the iliofemoral lig. and pubofemoral lig. on the anterior aspect of the hip @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020.

There is a second gap between the Iliofemoral lig. and the Ischiofemoral lig. on the posterior aspect of the hip @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020.

# Acetabular labrum {#labrum}

The acetabular labrum refers to the ring of *fibrocartilage* projecting from the *acetabular rim* @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

The labrum improves joint stability by helping to form the [mechanical seal](#mechanical-seal) of the hip joint @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.

The labrum maintains the environment for a healthy joint by creating a [fluid seal](#fluid-seal) for the synovial fluid @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.


# Synovium

## Fluid seal {#fluid-seal}
The fluid seal is supported by the:

- [Acetabular labrum](#acetabular-labrum) @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
