# Tone {#tone}

Skeletal muscle tone refers to baseline contraction or "tautness" the skeletal muscles have at rest @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.



Skeletal muscles do not contract without the action potential from the fibers, this tone is the product of low rate nerve impulses from the spinal cord @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
These *low level nerve impulses* are modulated partially by the brain and partially by the muscle spindles @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
The brain sends afferent signals to the anterior motoneurons of the spinal cord @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
The muscle spindle within the skeletal muscle sends signals to the muscle belly itself @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

## Dysfunction

Tone dysfunction can be divided into hypertonia, paratonia, or dystonia.

*Spasticity* and *rigidity* are the two types of hypertonia.
These forms of hypertonia result from dysfunction in the supraspinal pathways and the interaction between spinal cord and muscle spindle @gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021.

Dystonia and paratonia are *not* related to physiological dysfunction in tone pathways @gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021.
The other two disorders of altered tone, namely dystonia and paratonia, are not exactly related to the physiological dysfunction of the tone pathways @gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021.

In the motor control system, spasticity and rigidity are primarily an "output system" problem, whereas *dystonia* is a "system level processing" problem @gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021.

Dystonia and paratonia have altered tone secondary to network disruption in the basal ganglia, the thalamocortical circuits, and their connections.

# Motor control

Intrinsic motor control of a muscle is almost entirely dictate by information from [muscle spindles]({{< var ref-muscle-spindle.path >}}) and [golgi tendon organs]({{< var ref-golgi-tendon-organ.path >}})

# Sensory endings

II 6–12 μm myelinated Secondary spindle ending Muscle length (little rate sensitivity)  
II 6–12 μm myelinated Nonspindle endings Deep pressure  
III 2–6 μm myelinated Free nerve endings Pain, chemical stimuli, and temperature (important for physiological responses to exercise)  
IV 0.5–2 μm nonmyelinated Free nerve endings Pain, chemical stimuli, and temperature

## Type Ia afferent {#type-ia-afferent}

- AKA "primary ending" or "annulospiral ending" @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021
- Refers to a large sensory nerve fiber that encircles the central (receptor) portion of each intrafusal fiber @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021
- Found in the center of the muscle spindle @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021  
- ~17&micro;m in diameter @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
- Transmission velocity: 70-120 m/s (fast as any type of nerve fiber in the body) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

Type Ia afferents are excited by all 3 intrafusal sensory fibers: [static nuclear bag fibers](#static-nuclear-bag-fibers), [dynamic nuclear bag fibers](#dynamic-nuclear-bag-fibers), and [nuclear chain fibers](#nuclear-chain-fibers) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
This allows type Ia afferents to receive and transmit information about **both** length of receptor (static response) and rate of change of receptor length (dynamic response) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.


::: {.callout}
"Selective stimulation of the two types of gamma motor neurons has different effects on the firing of the Ia sensory fibers from the spindle. Without gamma stimulation, the Ia fiber shows a small dynamic response to muscle stretch and a modest increase in steady-state firing. When a static gamma motor neuron is stimulated, the steadystate response of the Ia fiber increases but the dynamic response decreases. When a dynamic gamma motor neuron is stimulated, the dynamic response of the Ia fiber is markedly enhanced, but the steady-state response gradually returns to its original level." @kandelPrinciplesNeuralScience2021
:::

## Type Ib afferent {#type-1b-afferent}

## Type II afferent {#type-ii-afferent}

- [Type II afferent]({{< var ref-type-ii-afferent.path >}}) AKA "secondary afferent ending" @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021
- Sometimes encircles intrafusal fibers similar to [type Ia fibers](#primary-ending) but more often spreads out like branches known as "flowerspray endings" @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
- ~8&micro;m diameter @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021

Type II afferents receive information **only** from [nuclear chain fibers](#nuclear-chain-fibers) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
As a result, type II afferents can only receive and transmit information regarding length of a receptor (static response) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

## Type III afferent {#type-iii-afferent}

## Type IV afferent {#type-iv-afferent}

# Muscle spindle {#muscle-spindle}


Muscle spindles are special sensory receptors located in the muscle belly that transmit *muscle length* and *rate of change of muscle length* to the nervous system @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

- Muscle spindles are ~3-10mm in length @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021
- Muscle spindles are surrounded by 3-12 [intrafusal fibers](#intrafusal-fibers) @hallettFunctionalNeurologicDisorders2016
- The [intrafusal fibers](#intrafusal-fibers) are pointed at the ends of the muscle spindle and attach to the glycocalyx of the [extrafusal fibers](#extrafusal-fibers) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

The midportion of the muscle spindle contains its sensory "stretch" receptors @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
There are 2 ways a muscle spindle can be excited:

1. Lengthening of the entire muscle results in a stretch of the midportion of the muscle spindle @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
1. Contraction at both ends of the muscle spindle @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

There are 2 sensory endings in the midportion of the muscle spindle: [type Ia afferent](#type-ia-afferent) and [type II afferent](#type-ii-afferent)



## Intrafusal fibers {#intrafusal-fiber}

Intrafusal fibers are tiny skeletal muscle fibers.
Intrafusal fibers are distinct from [extrafusal fibers](#extrafusal-fibers) since intrafusal fibers have little to no actin and myosin filaments between its two ends @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
As a result, when activated, the central portion of the intrafusal muscle fiber does *not* contract when the ends contract, but rather functions as a sensory receptor @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

The central portion of the intrafusal fiber is encircled by a large [type Ia afferent]({{< var ref-type-ia-afferent.path >}}) which forms the *primary ending* (annulospiral ending) and transmits sensory afferent signals to the spinal cord @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

Motor signals from the small [type A &gamma;-motor neurons]({{< var ref-type-A-gamma-motor-neuron >}}) in the [anterior horn of the spinal cord]() are sent through [&gamma;-motor neurons]({{< var ref-gamma-motor-neuron.path >}}) to activate the [intrafusal fibers]({{< var ref-skeletal-muscle.intrafusal-fibers >}}) causing its ends containing actin and myosin to contract [@gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021; @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021].

There are 3 types of intrafusal fiber: [*Dynamic* and *Static* Nuclear bag fibers](#nuclear-bag-fibers) and [nuclear chain fibers](#nuclear-chain-fibers) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

### Dynamic Nuclear bag fibers {#dynamic-nuclear-bag-fiber}

### Static Nuclear bag fibers {#nuclear-bag-fiber}

- 1-3 per muscle spindle @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021
- These get their name since the nuclear are congregated into "bags" in the central portion of the intrafusal fiber @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

Nuclear bag fibers can only activate [type Ia afferents]({{< var ref-type-ia-afferent.path >}}) and *cannot* activate [type II afferents]({{< var ref-type-ii-afferent.path >}}) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

Nuclear bag fibers contract when activated by &gamma;-dynamic motor efferents @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
This contraction enhances the [dynamic response](#dynamic-response) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

### Nuclear chain fibers {#nuclear-chain-fiber}

- 3-9 per muscle spindle @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021
- 50% smaller than [nuclear bag fibers](#nuclear-bag-fibers) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
- 50% shorter than [nuclear bag fibers](#nuclear-bag-fibers) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
- The name "chain" comes from the way the nuclei are aligned in a chain through the receptor area @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

Nuclear chain fibers can activate both [type II afferents]({{< var ref-type-ii-afferent.path >}}) and [type Ia afferents]({{< var ref-type-ia-afferent.path >}}) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

Nuclear chain fibers contract when activated by &gamma;-static motor efferents @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
Contraction of nuclear chain fibers enhances the [static response](#static-response)
## Responses

There are 2 responses detected by the muscle spindle:

1. Static response: Length of the receptor changes
1. Dynamic response: Rate of change of receptor length

### Static response

The static response refers to a receptor response to change in the length of the receptor.

The static response occurs when the central (receptor) portion of the intrafusal fibers are stretched **slowly** @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
During this, the [nuclear chain fibers](#nuclear-chain-fibers) are activated and transmit signals to the [type Ia]({{< var ref-type-ia-afferent.path >}}) and [II]({{< var ref-type-ii-afferent.path >}}) afferents.
The number of signals transmitted by [type Ia]({{< var ref-type-ia-afferent.path >}}) and [II]({{< var ref-type-ii-afferent.path >}}) afferents is **directly proportional** to the **amount of stretch** @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

The [type Ia]({{< var ref-type-ia-afferent.path >}}) and [II]({{< var ref-type-ii-afferent.path >}}) afferents will continue to send these signals for several minutes @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

### Dynamic response

The dynamic response refers to the *rate* of change in receptor length @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

The dynamic response occurs when the central (receptor) portion of the intrafusal fibers are stretched suddenly @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
The [nuclear bag fibers](#nuclear-bag-fibers) detect this rapid and sudden stretch and transmit this signal to *only* the [type Ia afferent] @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

This is a *powerful* activation, much stronger than the [static response](#static-response) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

This can be activated even when the intrafusal fiber is stretched &lt;1&micro;m for a fraction of a second and will still result in a powerful activation, sending a high number of impulses through the [type Ia afferent]({{< var ref-type-ia-afferent.path >}}) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
This powerful stimulation only occurs while the **length is actually increasing** and it stops and returns to the [static response](#static-response) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

::: {.callout-note}
Shortening of the intrafusal fiber can also incur a response, notifying the spinal cord of a decrease in intrafusal length @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
:::

## Motor efferents {#gamma-efferent}

&gamma;-motor efferents are important in controlling the *intensity* of the [static](#static-response) and [dynamic responses](#dynamic-response) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

There are two types:

1. [&gamma;-dynamic efferents (&gamma;-d)](#gamma-dynamic)
1. [&gamma;-static efferents (&gamma;-s)](#gamma-static)

### Gamma-dynamic {#gamma-dynamic}

Mainly excites [nuclear bag intrafusal fibers](#nuclear-bag-fibers) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

When the &gamma;-d efferents excite the [nuclear bag fibers]({{< var ref-intrafusal-fiber.nuclear-bag-fiber >}}), this *enhances* the [dynamic response]({{< var ref-muscle-spindle.dynamic-response >}}) and negligibly impacts the [static response]({{< var ref-muscle-spindle.static-response >}}) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

### Gamma-static {#gamma-static}

Mainly excites the [nuclear chain intrafusal fibers](#nuclear-chain-fibers) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

&gamma;-s excitation of the [nuclear chain fibers]({{< var ref-intrafusal-fiber.nuclear-chain-fiber >}}) *enhances* the [static response]({{< var ref-muscle-spindle.static-response >}}) and negligibly impacts the [dynamic response]({{< var ref-muscle-spindle.dynamic-response >}}) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.



# Extrafusal fibers {#extrafusal-fiber}


The [&alpha;-motor neurons (type A&alpha-nerve fiber)]({{< var ref-alpha-motor-neuron.path >}}) activate the [extrafusal fibers]({{< var ref-skeletal-muscle.extrafusual-fibers >}}) [@gangulyMuscleTonePhysiology2021; @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021].




# Exercise

"The final common determinant of success in athletic events is what the muscles can do for you—that is, what strength they can give when it is needed, what power they can achieve in the performance of work, and how long they can continue their activity. " @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021

# Muscular Strength

"The strength of a muscle is determined mainly by its size, with a maximal contractile force between 3 and 4 kg/cm2 of muscle cross-sectional area. Thus, a person who has enlarged his or her muscles through an exercise training program will have correspondingly increased muscle strength." @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021 

"To give an example of muscle strength, a world-class male weight lifter might have a quadriceps muscle with a cross-sectional area as great as 150 square centimeters. This measurement would translate into a maximal contractile strength of 525 kilograms (or 1155 pounds), with all this force applied to the patellar tendon. Therefore, one can readily understand how it is possible for this tendon at times to be ruptured or actually to be avulsed from its insertion into the tibia below the knee. Also, when such forces occur in tendons that span a joint, similar forces are applied to the surfaces of the joint or sometimes to ligaments spanning the joints, thus accounting for such happenings as displaced cartilages, compression fractures about the joint, and torn ligaments." @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021 

## Holding Strength

"The holding strength of muscles is about 40% greater than the contractile strength. That is, if a muscle is already contracted and a force then attempts to stretch out the muscle, as occurs when landing after a jump, this action requires about 40% more force than can be achieved by a shortening contraction. Therefore, the force of 525 kilograms previously calculated for the patellar tendon during muscle contraction becomes 735 kilograms (1617 pounds) during holding contractions, which further compounds the problems of the tendons, joints, and ligaments. It can also lead to internal tearing in the muscle. In fact, forceful stretching of a maximally contracted muscle is one of the surest ways to create the highest degree of muscle soreness." @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021 

# Mechanical Work

"Mechanical work performed by a muscle is the amount of force applied by the muscle multiplied by the distance over which the force is applied. The power of muscle contraction is different from muscle strength because power is a measure of the total amount of work that the muscle performs in a unit period of time. Power is therefore determined not only by the strength of muscle contraction but also by its distance of contraction and the number of times that it contracts each minute. Muscle power is generally measured in kilogram meters (kg-m) per minute. That is, a muscle that can lift 1-kilogram weight to a height of 1 meter or that can move some object laterally against a force of 1 kilogram for a distance of 1 meter in 1 minute is said to have a power of 1 kg-m/min. The maximal power achievable by all the muscles in the body of a highly trained athlete with all the muscles working together is approximately the following:" @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021

See more at the [Myofascial trigger point page]({{< var ref-myofascial-trigger-point.path >}}).



# Tightness

*Muscle Tightness* refers to a pathological state of a muscle @bhimaniConsensusDefinitionMuscle2020.

Although muscle tightness is frequently used interchangeably with terms like "Muscle tension" or "muscle tone" these are distinct terms @bhimaniConsensusDefinitionMuscle2020.

Some definitions of muscle tightness include "decreased range of motion" but this is faulty since it implies that muscle tightness is mainly in the extremities and does not include throat, chest, abdomen, etc @bhimaniConsensusDefinitionMuscle2020.



Definition:

- Range of motion of associated segments @bhimaniConsensusDefinitionMuscle2020
- Loss of Daily functioning: Loss of function such as *activities of daily living* was considered a sign of muscle tightness @bhimaniConsensusDefinitionMuscle2020.
- Change in muscle tissue texture: Sometimes tight muscles are **dense**, **ropey**, and **lack pliability** @bhimaniConsensusDefinitionMuscle2020.
- Change in sensation: Patients may complain of change in sensation, such as increased irritation, soreness, and a swollen feeling @bhimaniConsensusDefinitionMuscle2020.
- Pain: @bhimaniConsensusDefinitionMuscle2020
- Asymmetry: Could be asymmetry from left to right, or during postural observation, or gait @bhimaniConsensusDefinitionMuscle2020.
- Contracted muscle state: A "tight" muscle is in a shortened and contracted state @bhimaniConsensusDefinitionMuscle2020.

Final definition: "Muscle tightness is an inability of a muscle(s) or muscle groups to move through a full  range of motion for a specified body part. The muscle(s) may undergo a change in tissue  quality and result in a semi-contracted state in which the muscle(s) are unable to relax or  lengthen. The tightness in the muscle produces and causes asymmetry and restricts  flexibility. This may result in loss of partial or full function for the affected muscle(s) or  muscle group. Muscle tightness may or may not include uncomfortable sensations or pain  experiences." @bhimaniConsensusDefinitionMuscle2020.



# Guarding

*Guarding* is a phrase used commonly at my clinical with Brad Jones @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
We used the term *guarding* to refer to a muscle that had increased tension.

A guarded muscle was seen as a muscle that was compensating for other dysfunction and being *overused* @jonesProjectFoundations2025.
