Thyroid gland produces hormones that act to control the rate at which cells burn the fuel from food.




The anterior pituitary releases <i>thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)</i> which stimulates the [thyroid gland]({{< var ref-thyroid-gland.path >}}) to produce and release more <i>Triiodothvronine (T3)</i> and <i>Thyroxine (T4)</i>. 


# Dysfunction


When dysfunctional, the thyroid gland can either be overactive or underactive.
