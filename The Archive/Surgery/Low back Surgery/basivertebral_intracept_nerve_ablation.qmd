title: Basivertebral Nerve Ablation (Intracept)
---

# Anatomical and Physiological Basis

During degenerative disease, the degeneration can lead to damage to nociceptors in the vertebral end plates which transmit pain signals via the *basivertebral nerves* @huangBasivertebralNerveAblation2022.
Basivertebral nerves (BVNs) are sensory afferents that transmit nociceptive signals from the vertebral endplate @huangBasivertebralNerveAblation2022.

# Technique

## Anesthesia

This procedure can use a variety of anesthesia such as general anesthesia or moderate sedation @huangBasivertebralNerveAblation2022.
<!-- basivertebral ablation (BVA) is the Intracept system by Relievant (Intracept System, Relievant Medsystems, Sunnyvale, CA), although radiofrequency ablation of the basivertebral nerve can be achieved using other systems as well in Europe. -->
