title: Step width
---


Step width refers to the distance between the opposite feet in the frontal plane @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
This only takes into account frontal plane distance and **not** the distance in the sagittal plane.

When progressing from walking to running to sprinting, the step width should decrease and then become negative as a crossover gait pattern is utilized @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017.
