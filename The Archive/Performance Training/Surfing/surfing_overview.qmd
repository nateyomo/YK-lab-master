title: Surfing (Overview)
---

We can break surfing into multiple sections

- Paddling
    - Breathing
    - Endurance
    - Thoracic extension
- Duckdiving
- Paddle in
    - Double paddle
    - Kicking
- Takeoff (Pop-up)
- Bottom turn
- Surfing maneuvers


All surfing maneuvers are 3 dimensional techniques that require power, mobility, and stability in multiple planes of motion.



Fundamental parts of each maneuver:

- Compression
- Extension
- Rotation

# Pre-surf Warm up

- Shoulder movement prep
- Prone press

# Land training

The goal for land training is to improve surf recovery and to create general mobility and stability.
From a physical therapy perspective, we should be optimizing a surfer's body to be able to achieve their goals.
We should *not* be telling them *how* to surf.

## Improve mobility

- Prone press
    - This is designed to improve active thoracic extension
    - This is *not* supposed to be a way to replace a surfer's takeoff.

- Rotation
    - low-high chop - closing pattern

- Lateral deadlift
    - Stability while weight shifting

- Bridge position
    - 9090 Alternating hip thrust
    - Elevated long bridge
    - Elevated long bridge with contralateral press

## Plyos


- Ladder 90&deg; rotation jumps
    - focus on landing with both feet at the same time
