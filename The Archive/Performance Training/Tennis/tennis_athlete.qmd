# Tennis Serve {#tennis-serve}


When the shoulder is brought into overhead flexion during a serve, this aligns the myofascial lines of the [coracobrachialis]({{< var ref-coracobrachialis.action >}}) and [pectoralis minor]({{< var ref-pectoralis-minor.action >}}), allowing them to work together @myersAnatomyTrains2021.
These lines can be extended to the *Deep front of arm line* and the *Superficial Front Line* @myersAnatomyTrains2021.
