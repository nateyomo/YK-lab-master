# Functional Techniques Certification

## Chain reaction

Refers to the interplay between the joints and muscles when someone moves.



## Muscle function

Dr. Gray states that when he was studying in PT school, they were taught to perform assessments on the table in a "nonfunctional" and "context-dependent" position.

Gray states that in reality (based on studies they have read), the muscles do not have isolated functions in single planes or on select joints @grayinstituteFunctionalTechniques.
Rather, the muscles work on all 3 planes of motion and on multiple joints @grayinstituteFunctionalTechniques.

## Environment {#environment-fms}

Environment is one of the 3 physical principles.
You should be constantly asking yourself, "is this environmental functional for the goal?"



## Gravity & GRF {#gravity-grf-fms}




## Mass & Momentum {#mass-momentum-fms}

## Motion {#motion-fms}

## Reaction {#reaction-fms}

## Proprioceptors {#proprioceptors-fms}
## Muscles {#muscles-fms}
## Joints {#joints-fms}

## Task {#task-fms}

## Specificity {#specificity-fms}

Specificity is a way to change how functional a movement is.
Movements that have "Stagnation" of positions, are considered non-functional.
Whereas, movements with "Transformation" (changing position and momentum) are considered more functional.

Stagnation refers to when many of the movements that are specific to the functional goal, are being *inhibited*.

An example of a movement with transformation is walking/running, where the body alternates between force production and force absorption.

## Encouragement {#encouragement-fms}

## Empowerment {#empowerment-fms}

## Engagement {#engagement-fms}


# Foundations Certificate

In module 1, we took a deep dive into the *functional movement spectrum* and how it relates exercise prescription.
It is not necessarily a bad thing to be on the non-functional side of the spectrum, as long as you know that you are choosing nonfunctional movements and *why*.


In module 2, I learned about the importance of terminology and nomenclature.
The Gray Institute applies the "SFT Syntax": Sagittal Frontal Transverse.





# Alternative viewpoints


- Gray institute's AFS focuses on performing movements, rather than working on specific cues to correct the improper movements.
