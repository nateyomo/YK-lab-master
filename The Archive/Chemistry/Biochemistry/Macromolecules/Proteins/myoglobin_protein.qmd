# Myoglobinuria

Myoglobinuria refers to excess myoglobin in urea @armstrongMechanismsExerciseinducedDelayed1984.
Elevated levels are indicative of [exertional rhabdomyolysis]({{< var ref-exertional-rhabdomyolysis.path >}}) @armstrongMechanismsExerciseinducedDelayed1984.

Extended periods of high myoglobinuria can result in renal failure due to myoglobinuric tubular necrosis and other mechanisms which are not known @armstrongMechanismsExerciseinducedDelayed1984.
