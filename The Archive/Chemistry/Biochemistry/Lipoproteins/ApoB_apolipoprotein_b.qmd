title: Apolipoprotein B (Apo B)

According to Dr. Paul Mason, *Apo B* serves as a "tag" or "barcode" that is attached to the LDL lipoprotein as it leaves the liver.
If the *Apo B* "tag" remains intact after the LDL circulates, the liver will reuptake it.
If the *apo B* tag is damaged, the liver will not reuptake it.
