# Sunscreen function

Vitamin D<sub>3<sub> is form of vitamin D produced on the surface of human skin.
Dr. Paul Mason theorizes that this was designed to primarily function as a sunscreen.

Vitamin D<sub>3<sub> has properties that block UVB radiation and there is evidence that it was used as a sunscreen in many organisms for thousands of years.


Vitamin D<sub>3<sub> is synthesized on the skin when in the presence of UVB radiation from cholesterol, and if Vitamin D<sub>3<sub> does function as a sunscreen, this would explain why individuals with higher cholesterol have *lower* rates of skin cancer.
