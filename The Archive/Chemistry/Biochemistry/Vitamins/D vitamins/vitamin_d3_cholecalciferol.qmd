# Sunscreen function

*Cholecalciferol (D3)* is form of vitamin D produced on the surface of human skin.
Dr. Paul Mason theorizes that this was designed to primarily function as a sunscreen.

*Cholecalciferol* has properties that block UVB radiation and there is evidence that it was used as a sunscreen in many organisms for thousands of years.


*Cholecalciferol* is synthesized on the skin when in the presence of UVB radiation from cholesterol, and if *cholecalciferol* does function as a sunscreen, this would explain why individuals with higher cholesterol have *lower* rates of skin cancer.
