  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Rehabilitation is an important aspect of the continuum of care in stroke. With advances in the acute treatment of stroke, more patients will survive stroke with varying degrees of disability. Research in the past decade has expanded our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stroke recovery and has led to the development of new treatment modalities. This article reviews and summarizes the key concepts related to poststroke recovery.                                         Recent Findings:               Good data now exist by which one can predict recovery, especially motor recovery, very soon after stroke onset. Recent trials have not demonstrated a clear benefit associated with very early initiation of rehabilitative therapy after stroke in terms of improvement in poststroke outcomes. However, growing evidence suggests that shorter and more frequent sessions of therapy can be safely started in the first 24 to 48 hours after a stroke. The optimal amount or dose of therapy for stroke remains undetermined, as more intensive treatments have not been associated with better outcomes compared to standard intensities of therapy. Poststroke depression adversely affects recovery across a variety of measures and is an important target for therapy. Additionally, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appears to benefit motor recovery through pleiotropic mechanisms beyond their antidepressant effect. Other pharmacologic approaches also appear to have a benefit in stroke rehabilitation.                                         Summary:               A comprehensive rehabilitation program is essential to optimize poststroke outcomes. Rehabilitation is a process that uses three major principles of recovery: adaptation, restitution, and neuroplasticity. Based on these principles, multiple different approaches, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, exist to enhance rehabilitation. In addition to neurologists, a variety of health care professionals are involved in stroke rehabilitation. Successful rehabilitation involves understanding the natural history of stroke recovery and a multidisciplinary approach with judicious use of resources to identify and treat common poststroke sequelae.},

With the aging population, the number of people with atherosclerotic stroke will increase in the coming decades. This article reviews the recent developments in the assessment and treatment of extracranial and intracranial atherosclerotic disease.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               More intensive dual antiplatelet therapy can now be recommended for patients with transient ischemic attack or stroke. More stringent blood pressure and lipid control is also advised. The need for carotid revascularization will likely decrease in the coming decades because of advances in multimodal medical therapy; in particular, the role of revascularization for treating asymptomatic carotid stenosis is controversial. Patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis should receive intensive medical therapy. Interest in high-resolution carotid plaque imaging is growing.

RECENT FINDINGS               Although prior studies suggested women have worse outcomes after stroke, it is now clear that age, prestroke functional status, and comorbidities explain many of the differences between men and women in stroke severity, functional outcomes, and mortality. Several meta-analyses and large cohort studies have evaluated the risk factors for women related to reproductive factors and found that fewer years between menarche and menopause, pregnancy complications (preeclampsia/eclampsia, preterm delivery, and stillbirth), oophorectomy, hormone replacement therapy use, and younger age at menopause all increase the risk of stroke. Although the nonreproductive risks of stroke overlap between men and women, those with greater impact on women include age, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, socioeconomic status, and depression.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Extracranial or intracranial large artery atherosclerosis is often identified as a potential etiologic cause for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. Given the high prevalence of large artery atherosclerosis in the general population, determining whether an identified atherosclerotic lesion is truly the cause of a patient's symptomatology can be difficult. In all cases, optimally treating each patient to minimize future stroke risk is paramount. Extracranial or intracranial large artery atherosclerosis can be broadly compartmentalized into four distinct clinical scenarios based upon the individual patient's history, examination, and anatomic imaging findings: asymptomatic and symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis, intracranial atherosclerosis, and extracranial vertebral artery atherosclerotic disease. This review provides a framework for clinicians evaluating and treating such patients.                                         Recent Findings:               Intensive medical therapy achieves low rates of stroke and death in asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Evidence indicates that patients with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis should undergo carotid revascularization sooner rather than later and that the risk of stroke or death is lower using carotid endarterectomy than with carotid stenting. Specific to stenting, the risk of stroke or death is greatest among older patients and women. Continuous vascular risk factor optimization via sustained behavioral modifications and intensive medical therapy is the mainstay for stroke prevention in the setting of intracranial and vertebral artery origin atherosclerosis.                                         Summary:               Lifelong vascular risk factor optimization via sustained behavioral modifications and intensive medical therapy are the key elements to reduce future stroke risk in the setting of large artery atherosclerosis. When considering a revascularization procedure for carotid stenosis, patient demographics, comorbidities, and the periprocedural risks of stroke and death should be carefully considered.},

Recent Findings:               Up to a 10\% risk of recurrent stroke exists after a TIA, and up to 80\% of this risk is preventable with urgent assessment and treatment. Imaging of the brain and intracranial and extracranial blood vessels using CT, CT angiography, carotid Doppler ultrasound, and MRI is an important part of the diagnostic assessment. Treatment options include anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, carotid revascularization for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, antiplatelet therapy, and vascular risk factor reduction strategies.

These therapies contrast with acute stroke treatments such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and thrombectomy that target clots, aim to salvage threatened brain tissue to limit injury, and have a time window measured in hours. Restorative therapies target the brain, aim to promote plasticity within surviving brain tissue, and have a time window measured in days to weeks or longer.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               A number of drugs are under study. Preclinical studies are providing attractive therapeutic candidates for translation, such as the C-C chemokine receptor 5 inhibitor maraviroc. Some drug studies have used a pragmatic approach, which is premature for the nascent field of neural repair. Substantial data support the utility of activity-dependent therapies, including constraint-induced movement therapy, with recent studies supporting the need for very high doses to generate the best functional gains. While stem cell therapies are at an early stage, mounting preclinical evidence supports the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells; some initial human studies are supportive. Several types of brain stimulation have been examined, and in some cases initial studies are promising.

Management of these entities requires knowledge of which patients are at high risk for hemorrhage and what treatment options are available. This article summarizes the epidemiology, natural history, and management strategies for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations, developmental venous anomalies, and capillary telangiectasias.                                         Recent Findings:               Pooled cohort studies and meta-analyses have improved the ability to predict hemorrhage for each vascular abnormality. Scores and tools have been developed to aid the practitioner in predicting hemorrhage risk for unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Advances in endovascular techniques for unruptured intracranial aneurysms have improved the ability to treat difficult wide-necked aneurysms.                                         Summary:               Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are a common incidental finding. The PHASES (population, hypertension, age, size of aneurysm, earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage from another aneurysm, site of aneurysm) score and Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysm Treatment Score may be useful tools for predicting natural history and treatment recommendations. The overall risk of hemorrhage for both arteriovenous malformations and cavernous malformations is about 2\% to 4\% per year. With both of these entities, prior hemorrhage predicts future hemorrhage. In addition, other select patient and radiologic factors influence risk of hemorrhage. The risk of future hemorrhage should be compared to the risk of treatment. Developmental venous anomalies and capillary telangiectasias are largely benign entities and rarely symptomatic.},

Survivors of childhood stroke and their families are often left to cope with long-lasting sequelae, such as barriers to school reentry and long-term challenges in attaining independence as adults. Because childhood stroke is rare and providers may not be familiar with the disorder, this article reviews the risk factors, acute management, and sequelae of ischemic stroke in children.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               High-quality evidence has resulted in an organized approach to emergent treatment of ischemic stroke in adults, but most front-line providers are less prepared for emergent stroke management in children. The level of evidence for reperfusion therapies in children remains low but is growing. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy are sometimes considered for hyperacute treatment of stroke in children. Readiness for pediatric stroke at regional centers should include an organized approach to pediatric stroke triage and management based on extrapolation from adult stroke trials, expert consensus, and emerging pediatric studies.

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               The growing use of factor Xa inhibitors has increasingly caused patients with stroke to be excluded from treatment with IV thrombolysis. Important geographic, socioeconomic, sex, race, and ethnic disparities have been identified in the implementation of IV thrombolysis and need to be overcome. IV thrombolysis substantially improves outcomes when provided within the first golden hour after stroke onset in patients treated in mobile stroke units, supporting the ``time is brain'' concept and encouraging the possible value of more widespread implementation of the mobile stroke unit approach. At the same time, other studies have shown that IV thrombolysis can be successful in patients whose ``tissue clock'' is still ticking up to 9 hours after stroke onset or in patients who awaken with their stroke, as demonstrated by favorable imaging profiles. These considerations, along with the emergence of endovascular thrombectomy, have fostered examination of our care systems, including the ``drip and ship'' versus direct to comprehensive or endovascular thrombectomy stroke center approaches, as well as the possibility of skipping IV thrombolysis in certain patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy. Data suggesting that tenecteplase is at least noninferior to alteplase, as well as its more convenient dosing, has led to its increased use. Ongoing studies are evaluating newer thrombolytics and adding antithrombotic therapy to IV thrombolysis.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               IV thrombolysis remains the most common acute stroke treatment. Advances in acting faster to treat stroke have increased its efficacy, and advances in imaging have expanded its use.

In addition, the incidence of new and recurrent stroke is declining, likely because of the increased use of specific prevention medications, such as statins and antihypertensives. Despite these positive trends in incidence and mortality, many strokes remain preventable. The major modifiable risk factors are hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and hyperlipidemia, as well as lifestyle factors, such as obesity, poor diet/nutrition, and physical inactivity. This article reviews the current recommendations for the management of each of these modifiable risk factors.                                         Recent Findings:               It has been documented that some blood pressure medications may increase variability of blood pressure and ultimately increase the risk for stroke. Stroke prevention typically includes antiplatelet therapy (unless an indication for anticoagulation exists), so the most recent evidence supporting use of these drugs is reviewed. In addition, emerging risk factors, such as obstructive sleep apnea, electronic cigarettes, and elevated lipoprotein (a), are discussed.                                         Summary:               Overall, secondary stroke prevention includes a multifactorial approach.

Summary:               Medical complications from stroke are common and are associated with poor clinical outcomes, increased length of hospital stays and higher rates of readmission, increased cost of care, delayed time to rehabilitation, and increased mortality. Being cognizant of the common complications encountered, taking appropriate measures to prevent them, and knowing how to manage them when they do occur are essential to the continued care of patients with stroke.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Most cryptogenic strokes appear embolic, leading to the term                 embolic stroke of undetermined source                 . It was previously thought that embolic stroke of undetermined source was a single, therapeutically relevant entity, the underlying sources of which would respond to anticoagulant therapy; however, two large randomized trials found no benefit with anticoagulation compared to antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention after embolic stroke of undetermined source. A single antiplatelet drug remains the recommended long-term antithrombotic treatment for secondary stroke prevention in embolic stroke of undetermined source. However, three caveats should be considered with regard to cryptogenic stroke. First, those with minor stroke symptoms presenting early after onset should receive 3 weeks of dual antiplatelet therapy. Second, all patients with cryptogenic stroke should be monitored for atrial fibrillation. Third, patients 60 years of age or younger with a patent foramen ovale (PFO) should be carefully evaluated to determine whether the PFO may have caused the stroke and whether they might benefit from PFO closure.                                                        SUMMARY               More personalized strategies may soon be available to guide treatment of cryptogenic stroke. In the meantime, it is hoped that the application of recent findings from clinical trials will reduce stroke recurrence in this important population.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Recent developments for secondary stroke prevention include evidence to support the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy after minor stroke and transient ischemic attack, direct oral anticoagulants for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, reversal agents for direct oral anticoagulant--associated hemorrhage, and aspirin rather than presumptive anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant for embolic stroke of undetermined source.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), thrombosis of the dural sinus, cerebral veins, or both, is a rare cerebrovascular disease. Although mortality rates after CVT have declined over time, this condition can result in devastating neurologic outcomes. This article reviews the latest literature regarding CVT epidemiology, details new factors associated with the development of CVT, and describes advances in CVT treatment. It also contains a discussion of future directions in the field, including novel diagnostic imaging modalities, and potential strategies to reduce the risks associated with CVT.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               The incidence of CVT may be as high as 2 per 100,000 adults per year. It remains a difficult condition to diagnose given its variable clinical manifestations and the necessity of neuroimaging for confirmation. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a novel CVT trigger, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), as well as an association between COVID-19 infection and CVT. Although VITT is a very rare event, timely diagnosis and treatment of CVT due to VITT likely improves patient outcomes. Direct oral anticoagulants are currently being used to treat CVT and emerging data suggest that these agents are as safe and effective as vitamin K antagonists. The role of endovascular therapy to treat CVT, despite a recent clinical trial, remains unproven.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               The incidence of CVT has increased, outcomes have improved, and the use of direct oral anticoagulants to treat CVT represents an important advance in the clinical care of these patients. Rates of CVT as a complication of COVID-19 vaccines using adenoviral vectors are very low ({$<$}5 per million vaccine doses administered), with the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination far outweighing the risks.},

Recent Findings:               The risk for recurrence and mortality appear to be low for neonatal and childhood stroke. Most children have relatively mild deficits, but those who have greater neurologic deficits, poststroke epilepsy, or strokes early in life are at risk for lower overall cognitive function. Stroke recurrence and long-term mortality after stroke in young adults are greater than originally thought. Cognitive impairments, depression, and anxiety are associated with higher levels of poststroke unemployment and represent targets for improved poststroke care. Poststroke care in young adults involves more than medical management. Self-reported memory and executive function impairments may be more severe than what is detected by objective measures. Assessment of possible cognitive impairments and appropriate management of psychological comorbidities are key to maximizing the long-term functional outcome of stroke survivors.                                         Summary:               Childhood and young adult stroke survivors survive for many more years than older patients with stroke. To ensure that these survivors maximize the productivity of their lives, neurologists must not only optimize medical management but also recognize that impairments in cognition and mood may be remediable barriers to long-term functional independence.},

Recent Findings:               Fabry disease causes early-onset stroke, particularly of the vertebrobasilar system; enzyme replacement therapy should be considered in affected patients. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, causes migraines, early-onset lacunar strokes, and dementia. Moyamoya disease can cause either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke; revascularization is recommended in some patients. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy causes both microhemorrhages and macrohemorrhages, resulting in typical stroke symptoms and progressive dementia. Pregnancy raises the risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, particularly in women with preeclampsia/eclampsia. Pregnant women are also at risk for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Experts recommend that pregnant women with acute ischemic stroke not be systematically denied the potential benefits of IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.                                         Summary:               Neurologists should become familiar with these uncommon causes of stroke to provide future risk assessment and family counseling and to implement appropriate treatment plans to prevent recurrence.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in acute stroke treatment, including the use of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion and, more recently, of IV thrombolysis in an extended time window, have resulted in a paradigm shift in how imaging is used in patients with acute stroke. This paradigm shift, combined with the understanding that ``time is brain,'' means that imaging must be fast, reliable, and available around the clock for physicians to make appropriate clinical decisions. CT has therefore become the primary imaging modality of choice. Recognition of a large vessel occlusion using CT angiography has become essential in identifying patients for endovascular thrombectomy, and techniques such as imaging collaterals on CT angiography or measuring blood flow to predict tissue fate using CT perfusion have become useful tools in selecting patients for acute stroke therapy. Understanding the use of these imaging modalities and techniques in dealing with an emergency such as acute stroke has therefore become more important than ever for physicians treating patients with acute stroke.

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Identifying the presence of patent foramen ovale, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and unstable plaque is now routinely included in an increasingly nuanced workup in patients with stroke, even as ongoing trials seek to clarify the best approaches for treating these and other comorbidities. Multicenter trials have demonstrated the therapeutic utility of patent foramen ovale closure in select patients younger than age 60 years. Insertable cardiac monitors detect atrial fibrillation lasting more than 30 seconds in about one in ten patients monitored for 12 months following a stroke. MRI of carotid plaque can detect unstable plaque at risk of being a source of cerebral embolism.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               To optimize the prevention of recurrent stroke, it is important to consider pathologies of intracranial and extracranial blood vessels and of cardiac structure and rhythm as well as other inherited or systemic causes of stroke.

Its incidence is expected to rise because of the age-related incidence of atrial fibrillation and an aging population. This article summarizes the different causes of cardioembolism and outlines current management guidelines.                                         Recent Findings:               Since cardioembolic stroke is not a single disease entity, its diagnosis requires initial clinical suspicion and a comprehensive evaluation, including ECG, echocardiography, brain imaging, and cardiac monitoring. Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke, and anticoagulation is usually recommended. This article reviews risk stratification models to assist in the decision-making process and highlights the increased use of novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. New data support the importance of prolonged cardiac monitoring for diagnosing occult atrial fibrillation. Current data on other mechanisms of cardioembolic stroke, such as prosthetic heart valves and aortic arch atherosclerosis, are also presented, and the available evidence regarding patent foramen ovale closure in cryptogenic stroke is summarized.

More effective approaches to enhance motor recovery following stroke are needed. This article reviews the rehabilitative principles and strategies that can be used to maximize post-stroke recovery.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Evidence dictates that mobilization should not begin prior to 24 hours following stroke, but detailed guidelines beyond this are lacking. Specific classes of potentially detrimental medications should be avoided in the early days poststroke. Patients with stroke who are unable to return home should be referred for evaluation to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Research suggests that a substantial increase in both the dose and intensity of upper and lower extremity exercise is beneficial. A clinical trial supports vagus nerve stimulation as an adjunct to occupational therapy for motor recovery in the upper extremity. The data remain somewhat mixed as to whether robotics, transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation are better than dose-matched traditional exercise. No current drug therapy has been proven to augment exercise poststroke to enhance motor recovery.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Neurologists will collaborate with rehabilitation professionals for several months following a patient's stroke. Many questions still remain about the ideal exercise regimen to maximize motor recovery in patients poststroke.

RECENT FINDINGS               The incidence of ischemic stroke in young adults has been increasing since the 1980s, which has occurred in parallel with increasing prevalence of vascular risk factors and substance abuse among the younger population. Young adults have a considerably wider range of risk factors than older patients, including age-specific factors such as pregnancy/puerperium and oral contraceptive use. Behavioral risk factors such as low physical activity, excess alcohol consumption, and smoking are factors as well. More than 150 identified causes of early-onset ischemic stroke exist, including rare monogenic disorders. Several recent advances have been made in diagnosis and management of stroke in young adults, including molecular characterization of monogenic vasculitis due to deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 and transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale for secondary prevention. Compared with the background population of the same age and sex, long-term mortality in patients remains fourfold higher with cardiovascular causes underlying most of the deaths. The cumulative rate of recurrent stroke extends up to 15\% at 10 years. Patients with atherosclerosis, high-risk sources of cardioembolism, and small vessel disease underlying their stroke seem to have the worst prognosis regarding survival and recurrent vascular events. Young stroke survivors also often have other adverse outcomes in the long term, including epilepsy, pain, cognitive problems, and depression.                                         SUMMARY               Systematic identification of risk factors and causes and the motivation of patients for long-term prevention and lifestyle changes are of utmost importance to improve the prognosis of early-onset ischemic stroke.},

Recent Findings:               The results of several randomized controlled trials consistently and conclusively demonstrating that previously functional patients with disabling strokes from a proximal intracranial artery occlusion benefit from prompt recanalization with mechanical thrombectomy using a retrievable stent have changed the landscape of acute stroke therapy. Mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours of symptom onset should now be considered the preferred treatment for these patients along with IV thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within the first 4.5 hours for all patients who do not have contraindications for systemic thrombolysis. Patients who are ineligible for IV rtPA can also benefit from mechanical thrombectomy. Collateral status and time to reperfusion are the main determinants of outcome.                                         Summary:               Timely successful reperfusion is the most effective treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Systems of care should be optimized to maximize the number of patients with acute ischemic stroke able to receive reperfusion therapy.},

RECENT FINDINGS               In addition to the previously established indications for intravenous (IV) thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within 4.5 hours of stroke symptom onset and endovascular therapy with mechanical thrombectomy for patients with large artery occlusion who can be treated within 6 hours of symptom onset, recent randomized controlled trials have now established new indications for emergency reperfusion in patients with wake-up stroke or delayed presentation (up to 24 hours from last known well in the case of mechanical thrombectomy). Identification of patients who may benefit from acute reperfusion therapy within this extended time window requires screening with perfusion brain imaging or, in the case of IV thrombolysis for wake-up strokes, emergency brain MRI. Collateral status and time to reperfusion remain the primary determinants of outcome.

RECENT FINDINGS               Cerebral small vessel disease is increasingly prevalent and highly heterogeneous in neuroimaging and clinical presentation. Small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, cortical microinfarcts, and white matter hyperintensity of presumed vascular origin represent the major neuroimaging markers of small vessel disease. Increasing small vessel disease burden is associated with risk of incident stroke and dementia, as well as other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Current research strategies are targeting elucidation of the mechanisms of small vessel disease pathogenesis and pursuing clinical trials of therapeutic agents to reduce the clinical manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease.                                         SUMMARY               Cerebral small vessel disease is common in aging adults and represents a major risk factor for multiple acute and chronic neurologic diseases. Increased awareness of cerebral small vessel disease as a modifiable risk factor holds potential for reducing neurologic disease morbidity and mortality across diverse populations in the United States and worldwide.},

This article provides a practical approach to the management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms and unruptured brain AVMs and reviews the risk of rupture, risk factors for rupture, preventive treatment options with their associated risks, and the approach of treatment versus observation for both types of vascular malformations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               For unruptured intracranial aneurysms, scoring systems on the risk of rupture can help with choosing preventive treatment or observation with follow-up imaging. Although the literature provides detailed information on the complication risks of preventive treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, individualized predictions of these procedural complication risks are not yet available. With observation with imaging, growth of unruptured intracranial aneurysms can be monitored, and prediction scores for growth can help determine the optimal timing of monitoring. The past years have revealed more about the risk of complications of the different treatment modalities for brain AVMs. A randomized clinical trial and prospective follow-up data have shown that preventive interventional therapy in patients with brain AVMs is associated with a higher rate of neurologic morbidity and mortality compared with observation.                                         SUMMARY               The risk of hemorrhage from both unruptured intracranial aneurysms and brain AVMs varies depending on the number of risk factors associated with hemorrhage. For both types of vascular malformations, different preventive treatment options are available, and all carry risks of complications. For unruptured intracranial aneurysms, the consideration of preventive treatment versus observation is complex, and several factors should be included in the decision making. Overall, it is recommended that patients with unruptured asymptomatic brain AVMs should be observed.},

This article reviews the pathophysiology, etiology and risk factors, evaluation, management, and outcomes of spontaneous cervical artery dissection.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Cervical artery dissection is believed to be a multifactorial disease, with environmental factors serving as possible triggers in patients who have a genetic predisposition to dissection formation. Cervical artery dissection can cause local symptoms or ischemic events, such as ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Neuroimaging is used to confirm the diagnosis; classic findings include a long tapered arterial stenosis or occlusion, dissecting aneurysm, intimal flap, double lumen, or intramural hematoma. Patients with cervical artery dissection who present with an acute ischemic stroke should be evaluated for IV thrombolysis, endovascular therapy eligibility, or both. Antithrombotic therapy with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment is used to prevent stroke from cervical artery dissection. The risk of recurrent ischemia appears low and is mostly limited to the first two weeks after symptom onset.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Cervical artery dissection is a known cause of ischemic strokes. Current data show no difference between the benefits and risks of anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy in the acute phase of symptomatic extracranial cervical artery dissection, thereby supporting the recommendation that clinicians can prescribe either treatment. Further research is warranted to better understand the pathophysiology and long-term outcomes of cervical artery dissection.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common neurologic condition that contributes to considerable mortality and disability because of its impact on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke risk and dementia. While attributes of the disease have been recognized for over two centuries, gaps in knowledge remain related to its prevention and management. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge for CSVD.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS                                CSVD can be recognized by well-defined radiographic criteria, but the pathogenic mechanism behind the disease is unclear. Hypertension control remains the best-known strategy for stroke prevention in patients with CSVD, and recent guidelines provide a long-term blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mm Hg for patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, including those with stroke related to CSVD. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the second leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage and may be increasingly recognized because of newer, more sensitive imaging modalities.                 Transient focal neurologic episodes                 is a relatively new term used to describe ``amyloid spells.'' Guidance on distinguishing these events from seizures and transient ischemic attacks has been published.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               CSVD is prevalent and will likely be encountered by all neurologists in clinical practice. It is important for neurologists to be able to recognize CSVD, both radiographically and clinically, and to counsel patients on the prevention of disease progression. Blood pressure control is especially relevant, and strategies are needed to improve blood pressure control for primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with CSVD.},

This article summarizes some of the recent innovations in this field and discusses likely future developments.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               At present, there is robust activity to improve all facets of care for patients with large vessel occlusion stroke, including better prehospital routing, more efficient in-hospital screening, expanding indications for thrombectomy eligibility, innovating novel thrombectomy devices, and improving the effects of recanalization on clinical outcomes. In addition, the integration of endovascular stroke therapy (EVT)---an emergent and frequently off-hours procedure that requires a specialized team of nurses, technologists, and physicians---into acute stroke care has transformed referral patterns, hospital accreditation pathways, and physician practices. The eligibility for the procedure will potentially continue to grow to include patients screened without advanced imaging, larger core infarcts, and more distal occlusions.

RECENT FINDINGS               Six randomized controlled trials undoubtedly confirmed the benefits of using endovascular thrombectomy on the clinical outcome of patients with stroke with large vessel occlusion within 6 hours from symptom onset compared with those receiving only standard medical care. In a meta-analysis of individual patient data, the number needed to treat with endovascular thrombectomy to reduce disability by at least one level on the modified Rankin Scale for one patient was 2.6. Recently, the concept of ``tissue window'' versus time window has proved useful for selecting patients for mechanical thrombectomy up to 24 hours from symptom onset. The DAWN (DWI or CTP Assessment With Clinical Mismatch in the Triage of Wake-Up and Late Presenting Strokes Undergoing Neurointervention) trial included patients at a median of 12.5 hours from onset and showed the largest effect in functional outcome ever described in any acute stroke treatment trial (35.5\% increase in functional independence). In DEFUSE 3 (Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution 3), patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy at a median of 11 hours after onset had a 28\% increase in functional independence and an additional 20\% absolute reduction in death or severe disability.                                         SUMMARY               For patients with acute ischemic stroke and a large vessel occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation who can be treated within 6 hours of stroke symptom onset, mechanical thrombectomy with a second-generation stent retriever or a catheter aspiration device should be indicated regardless of whether the patient received treatment with intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in patients with limited signs of early ischemic changes on neuroimaging. Two clinical trials completely disrupted the time window concept in acute ischemic stroke, showing excellent clinical outcomes in patients treated up to 24 hours from symptom onset. Time of ischemia is, on average, a good biomarker for tissue viability; however, the window of opportunity for treatment varies across different individuals because of a range of compensatory mechanisms. Adjusting time to the adequacy of collateral flow leads to the concept of tissue window, a paradigm shift in stroke reperfusion therapy.},

This article examines the evidence for using the available options.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Carotid endarterectomy is an effective treatment option for reducing the risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients. Patients should be stratified for future stroke risk based on both the degree of stenosis and the presence of symptoms referable to the culprit lesion. Carotid stenting is also useful in reducing stroke risk, again in carefully selected patients. Because of the publication of significant data regarding both carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting in the last several years, selection can be far more personalized and refined for individual patients based on demographics, sex, patient preference, and medical comorbidities. Routine extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery remains unproven as a therapeutic option for large vessel occlusion in reducing the incidence of ischemic stroke although some carefully screened patient populations remaining at high risk may benefit; procedural risks and pathology related to alterations in blood flow dynamics are challenges to overcome. Indirect revascularization remains an appropriate solution for carefully selected patients with cerebral large vessel steno-occlusive disease, and multiple variations of surgical technique are patient specific. Indirect revascularization may benefit from clinical trials with larger patient populations for validation in specific pathologies and offers the advantages of lower surgical complication rates and reduced risk of pathologic responses to altered cerebral flow dynamics.

Prompt diagnosis of the underlying mechanism may improve secondary prevention strategies. This article reviews recent randomized trials, observational studies, case reports, and guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of cardioembolic stroke.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Several pathologies can lead to cardioembolic stroke, including atrial fibrillation, aortic arch atheroma, patent foramen ovale, left ventricular dysfunction, and many others. Secondary stroke prevention strategies differ across these heterogeneous mechanisms. In addition to medical treatment advances such as the use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation, surgical treatments such as closure of patent foramen ovale have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in select patients. Furthermore, left atrial appendage occlusion is a promising strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation who are candidates for short-term oral anticoagulation therapy but not long-term oral anticoagulation therapy.
