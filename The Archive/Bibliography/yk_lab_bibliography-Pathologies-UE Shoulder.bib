  abstract = {Swimming has become a popular recreational activity as well as a highly competitive sport in the United States. The repetitive nature of swimming can predispose the shoulder to mechanical impingement and microtrauma, which may lead to laxity, rotator cuff fatigue, and subsequent secondary impingement. Improper stroke mechanics can place the swimmer's shoulder at further risk. The purpose of this paper is to describe the pathology of secondary impingement in freestyle swimmers and to discuss the clinical implications for rehabilitation of swimmers with the pathology. A thorough subjective and objective evaluation is necessary to design a successful rehabilitation program. The rehabilitation program for swimmers with secondary impingement includes modification of training, flexibility, range of motion, strengthening, and mobilization as indicated. Functional and proprioceptive training may also be useful techniques in the rehabilitation of swimmer's shoulder. Improper stroke mechanics can also have clinical implications on swimmer's shoulders with secondary impingement. The clinical implication of secondary impingement in freestyle swimmers suggests that the primary goal of rehabilitation is to promote equilibrium of the shoulder complex while accounting for the demands of the sport.},

The purpose of this study is to create a systematic review evaluating postsurgical rehabilitation protocols treating MDI. Articles were included if a postsurgical rehabilitation protocol was described following surgical treatment for MDI. Identified articles underwent 2 phases of screening by blinded team members. Remaining articles had their level of evidence determined by a predefined grading system, ranging from levels I to V. Articles with evidence levels I to IV were included in analysis. Of the 163 articles identified in the literature, 9 were included in this study. Surgical techniques examined in these articles include capsular plication, rotator interval closure, and capsular shift. Rehabilitation protocols were evaluated for duration of treatment and physical therapy modalities. Article results were evaluated for subjective and objective measures of protocol success. Overall, there is a lack of evidence to indicate the optimal rehabilitation protocol post-MDI surgery. Further research is needed to compare rehabilitation protocols following specific surgical procedures to determine their effect on postsurgical patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Traditional rehabilitation for shoulder dislocation has a success rate of only 20\%. The body blade has been hypothesized to strengthen the muscles stabilizing the shoulder girdle by training the contractile tissues directly and also indirectly affecting the joint and surrounding noncontractile tissues when responding to rapid positional changes and mechanical energy. Shoulder dislocation negatively affects both the active (musculature) and passive (joint and ligaments) stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint. Therefore, the purpose of this case report was to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic exercise using the body blade in the conservative management of an individual with glenohumeral instability. The patient, an 18-year-old male, dislocated his left shoulder after a wave crashed on top of him. Intervention included therapeutic exercise using the body blade. Measures were taken at examination, re-evaluation (6th visit), and discharge (11th visit). According to the 11-point numeric pain rating scale, worst pain was reduced from 4 to 0. Glenohumeral ROM measures at discharge were all within normal range except external rotation (deficit of 10 degrees), compared to the initial ROM deficits of 10-35\% of noninvolved values. Post intervention strength, as assessed by handheld dynamometry, revealed deficits only in scapular retraction compared to the uninvolved side (21\% compared to an initial deficit of 39\%). Other muscle groups showing deficits from 20\% to 40\% at initial examination exceeded the comparative strength of the other limb at discharge. The SPADI and WOSI scores were reduced from 13 to 0 and 482 to 46, from initial examination to discharge, respectively. Furthermore 6 months post episode of care the patient reported no recurrent dislocation of the involved shoulder. The success rate of an exercise program with individuals who have dislocated their glenohumeral joint is poor. After 11 visits of physical therapy using the body blade the patient improved in ROM, strength, and function.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an exercise protocol, with and without manual therapy, on scapular kinematics, function, pain, and mechanical sensitivity in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. BACKGROUND: Stretching and strengthening exercises have been shown to effectively decrease pain and disability in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. There is still conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of adding manual therapy to an exercise therapy regimen. METHODS: Forty-six patients were assigned to 1 of 2 groups, one of which received a 4-week intervention of stretching and strengthening exercises (exercise alone) and the other the same intervention, supplemented by manual therapy targeting the shoulder and cervical spine (exercise plus manual therapy). All outcomes were measured preintervention and postintervention at 4 weeks. Outcome measures were scapular kinematics in the scapular and sagittal planes during arm elevation, function as determined through the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, pain as assessed with a visual analog scale, and mechanical sensitivity as assessed with pressure pain threshold. RESULTS: Independent of the intervention group, small, clinically irrelevant changes in scapular kinematics were observed postintervention. A significant group-by-time interaction effect (P = .001) was found for scapular anterior tilt during elevation in the sagittal plane, with a 3.0{$^\circ$} increase (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -1.5{$^\circ$}, 7.5{$^\circ$}) relative to baseline in the exercise-plus-manual therapy group compared to a decrease of 0.3{$^\circ$} (95\% CI: -4.2{$^\circ$}, 4.8{$^\circ$}) in the exercise-alone group. Pain, mechanical sensitivity, and the DASH score improved similarly for both groups by the end of the intervention period. CONCLUSION: Adding manual therapy to an exercise protocol did not enhance improvements in scapular kinematics, function, and pain in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. The noted improvements in pain and function are not likely explained by changes in scapular kinematics.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To give an overview of current knowledge and guidelines with respect to evidence-based rehabilitation of athletes with glenohumeral instability. METHODS: This narrative review combines scientific evidence with clinical guidelines based on the current literature to highlight the different components of the rehabilitation of glenohumeral instability. RESULTS: Depending on the specific characteristics of the instability pattern, the severity, recurrence, and direction, the therapeutic approach may be adapted to the needs and demands of the athlete. In general, attention should go to (1) restoration of rotator cuff strength and inter-muscular balance, focusing on the eccentric capacity of the external rotators, (2) normalization of rotational range of motion with special attention to the internal rotation ROM, (3) optimization of the flexibility and muscle performance of the scapular muscles, and (4) gradually increasing the functional sport-specific load on the shoulder girdle. The functional kinetic chain should be implemented throughout all stages of the rehabilitation program. Return to play should be based on subjective assessment as well as objective measurements of ROM, strength, and function. CONCLUSIONS: This paper summarizes evidence-based guidelines for treatment of glenohumeral instability. These guidelines may assist the clinician in the prevention and rehabilitation of the overhead athlete. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Expert opinion, Level V.},

There are sections covering the mechanisms of shoulder stability, the clinical assessment of patients and imaging techniques. Beyond that there is a discussion on the common classifications systems used and the typical management options. Some patients fall into reasonably well defined categories of classification and in these cases, the management plan is relatively easy to define. Unfortunately, other patients can elude simple classification and in these instances their management requires very careful consideration.

Outcomes considered included recurrence of instability and return to premorbid function. Overall, the quantity and quality of evidence were low. Immobilization for three to four weeks followed by a structured 12-week rehabilitation program of range of motion and glenohumeral and scapular stability exercises for patients with primary dislocations to maximize return to premorbid activity level is supported by weak evidence. Level II evidence suggests that recurrence is lower in patients managed with surgical as compared with conservative management.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: A variety of instabilities are grouped under multidirectional instability (MDI) of the shoulder. This makes understanding its diagnostic process, presentation and treatment difficult due to lack of evidence-based consensus. This review aims to propose a novel classification for subtypes of MDI. METHODS: A systematic search was performed on PubMed Medline and Embase. A combination of the following 'MeSH' and 'non-MesH' search terms were used: (1) Glenohumeral joint[tiab] OR Glenohumeral[tiab] OR Shoulder[tiab] OR Shoulder joint[tiab] OR Shoulder[MeSH] OR Shoulder joint[MeSH], (2) Multidirectional[tiab], (3) Instability[tiab] OR Joint instability[MeSH]. Sixty-eight publications which met our criteria were included. RESULTS: There was a high degree of heterogeneity in the definition of MDI. Thirty-one studies (46\%) included a trauma etiology in the definition, while 23 studies (34\%) did not. Twenty-five studies (37\%) excluded patients with labral or bony injuries. Only 15 (22\%) studies defined MDI as a global instability (instability in all directions), while 28 (41\%) studies considered MDI to be instability in two directions, of which one had to include the inferior direction. Six (9\%) studies included the presence of global ligamentous laxity as part of the definition. To improve scientific accuracy, the authors propose a novel AB classification which considers traumatic etiology and the presence of hyperlaxity when subdividing MDI. CONCLUSION: MDI is defined as symptomatic instability of the shoulder joint in two or more directions. A comprehensive classification system that considers predisposing trauma and the presence of hyperlaxity can provide a more precise assessment of the various existing subtypes of MDI.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the muscle activity of patients with multidirectional instability treated in a conservative or complex manner (capsular shift with postoperative rehabilitation) and the muscle activity of stable shoulder joints before and after treatment during pull, push, and elevation of upper extremities and during overhead throw. SCOPE: The study was carried out on 34 patients with multidirectional shoulder instability treated non-operatively, on 31 patients with multidirectional shoulder instability treated operatively, and on 50 healthy subjects. Signals were recorded by surface EMG from eight different muscles. The mean and standard deviation of the maximum amplitude of normalized voluntary electrical activity for the different movement types and time broadness values during overhead throw were determined for each muscle in all groups and compared with each other. CONCLUSION: The centralization of the glenohumeral joint and the reduction of instability is attempted to be ensured by the organism through increasing the role of rotator cuff muscles (p=0.009) and decreasing the role of the deltoid, biceps brachii, and pectoralis maior muscles (p=0.007). At patients after short-term and long-term conservative treatment, the maximum amplitude of normalized voluntary electrical activity of stabilizer muscles is significantly higher (p=0.006), and that of accelerator muscles is significantly lower (p=0.005) and the time broadness is significantly longer (p=0.01) than that of the control group. At patients after complex treatment (open capsular shift with postoperative conservative rehabilitation) the characteristic of the muscle pattern is similar (p=0.19) to the control group. The complex treatment resolves the labral ligamentous abnormalities by operative treatment and restores the impaired muscular control by postoperative rehabilitation, whereas the conservative treatment restores only the muscular control.},

  abstract = {Multidirectional instability (MDI) of the shoulder was first described in 1980 as a complex condition of the shoulder defined by instability in 2 or more planes of motion.~The shoulder joint is unique in the way it provides a tremendous range of motion. In fact, it has the greatest mobility of any joint in the human body. However, mobility and stability are inversely proportional, and the complex interplay between the stabilizers of the shoulder works with little margin for error before instability occurs. Therefore the balance between the extraordinary physiologic range of motion and shoulder stability has proved to be delicate. The primary responsibility of the shoulder is to position the hand in space. Hence, some activities show preference toward mobility (swimming) while others favor stability (weight lifting, football lineman).~Shoulder stability is maintained through both dynamic and static stabilizers. The dynamic structures responsible for joint stability include the rotator cuff muscles, the tendon of the long head of the biceps, and the periscapular musculature. The static stabilizers include the glenohumeral articular congruity, glenoid labrum complex, glenohumeral ligaments as well as the negative pressure created within the joint. Shoulder instability becomes symptomatic once the motion of the humeral head exceeds the boundaries set by the glenoid labrum complex. This is a result of pathology within the static and/or dynamic stabilizers. Shoulder instability was originally thought to fall within one of two categories. The first is Traumatic Unilateral with Bankart lesion treated Surgically (TUBS). The second category is Atraumatic, Multidirectional, Bilateral, which typically responds to Rehabilitation or Inferior capsular shift (AMBRI). Although these two categories offer a simple classification system for MDI, they are oversimplified and do not fully represent the full spectrum of pathologic laxity. As we have discovered more about the MDI process, modifications have been made to the original simplistic classification.},

  abstract = {\&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Introduction:\&lt;/b\&gt; Multidirectional shoulder instability (MDI) occurs when the shoulder is dislocating in at least two directions. The patient usually experiences pain with apprehension and a clicking sensation inside the joint. So far, a few classification scales of shoulder instability have been made. Despite this fact, MDI is highly problematic for clinicians in diagnosis and treating.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Aim:\&lt;/b\&gt; This article presents the current trends in the conservative treatment of multidirectional instability, assess effectiveness of rehabilitation and indicates the directions of MDI research.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Material and methods:\&lt;/b\&gt; In order to find current literature and conduct a critical analysis, the following scientific database was used: Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), MEDLINE and PubMed. We chose four articles which included a comparison of conservative and operative treatment, and four which evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Results:\&lt;/b\&gt; Low quality evidence shows priority of surgical treatment over conservative treatment. The protocol developed by Watson obtains a statistically significant advantage over the Burkhead and Rockwood protocol. Discussion: The effectiveness of rehabilitation reaches different levels. Rehabilitation should last from 3 to 12 months. If rehabilitation does not achieve a sufficient effect, arthroscopic methods of reducing the volume of the articular capsule should be considered. Due to the small number of scientific reports and their quality, the obtained data should be interpreted with caution. Much further research is required to create a precise and most effective algorithm.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Conclusion:\&lt;/b\&gt; Rehabilitation exercises play an important role in the treatment of multidirectional instability of the shoulder joint, especially when the patient has not had an injury. Exercise types and load should be dosed individually. At present, the protocol described by Watson is the most effective.\&lt;/br\&gt.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several functional outcome scores have been proposed for the evaluation of shoulder instability. Most are multiple-item questionnaires, which can be time-consuming and difficult for patients to understand, as well as leading to lack of compliance. The Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score is a single question that has recently gained widespread acceptance based on its simplicity and correlation with more complex scoring systems. The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation of a new modified version of the SANE score, the SANE-instability score, with the Rowe score after treatment for shoulder instability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated a consecutive series of 253 patients (268 shoulders) treated surgically or nonoperatively for shoulder instability between November 2017 and November 2019, for whom the Rowe and SANE-instability scores were collected before treatment and/or after treatment. The SANE-instability score was assessed with the following question: "What is the overall percent value of your shoulder if a completely stable shoulder represents 100\%?"~Correlations were tested using the Pearson~coefficient (r) and interpreted as very high (r = 0.90-1.00), high (r = 0.70-0.89), moderate (r = 0.50-0.69), low (r = 0.30-0.49), or negligible (r = 0.00-0.29). Subgroup analyses were also performed to observe correlation variations according to follow-up length (before treatment and at 6, 12, 26, 52, and 104 weeks after treatment), patient age ({$<$}20, 20-29, 30-39, or {$\geq$}40 years), and type of treatment (nonoperative or surgical). RESULTS: The overall correlation between the SANE-instability and Rowe scores was high (r = 0.85, P {$<$} .001). Subgroup analyses revealed that the correlation between the 2 scores was high before treatment (r = 0.74); moderate at 6 and 12 weeks after treatment (r = 0.66 and r = 0.57, respectively); and then high at 26, 52, and 104 weeks after treatment (r = 0.75, r = 0.75, and r = 0.78, respectively) (P {$<$} .001). The correlation was high across all types of treatment (r = 0.76-0.85), high for patients aged {$\geq$} 20 years (r = 0.80-0.86), and very high for patients aged {$<$} 20 years (r = 0.93) (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a significant correlation between the SANE-instability and Rowe scores before and after treatment, as well as across all patient age groups and treatments. Owing to its high simplicity, the SANE-instability score could be used as an alternative to the Rowe score for patient follow-up at various time points.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze outcomes of surgical and conservative treatment options for multidirectional instability (MDI). METHODS: A systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was performed. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases using various combinations of the keywords "shoulder," "multidirectional instability," "dislocation," "inferior instability," "capsulorrhaphy," "capsular plication," "capsular shift," "glenoid," "humeral head," "surgery," and "glenohumeral," over the years 1966 to 2014 was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-four articles describing patients with open capsular shift, arthroscopic treatment, and conservative or combined management in the setting of atraumatic MDI of the shoulder were included. A total of 861 shoulders in 790 patients was included. The median age was 24.3 years, ranging from 9 to 56 years. The dominant side was involved in 269 (58\%) of 468 shoulders, whereas the nondominant side was involved in 199 (42\%) shoulders. Patients were assessed at a median follow-up period of 4.2 years (ranging from 9 months to 16 years). Fifty-two of 253 (21\%) patients undergoing physiotherapy required surgical intervention for MDI management, whereas the overall occurrence of redislocation was seen in 61 of 608 (10\%) shoulders undergoing surgical procedures. The redislocation event occurred in 17 of 226 (7.5\%) shoulders with open capsular shift management, in 21 of 268 (7.8\%) shoulders with arthroscopic plication management, in 12 of 49 (24.5\%) shoulders undergoing arthroscopic thermal shrinkage, and in 11 of 55 (22\%) shoulders undergoing arthroscopic laser-assisted capsulorrhaphy. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic capsular plication and open capsular shift are the best surgical procedures for treatment of MDI after failure of rehabilitative management. Arthroscopic capsular plication shows results comparable to open capsular shift. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV studies.},

  abstract = {In conclusion, instability as a cause of shoulder pain in the young athlete is a difficult and often missed diagnosis. These young patients often seek treatment of shoulder pain but do not recall any episodes of shoulder instability. As a result, these uncommon, poorly described forms of instability are often misdiagnosed. A heightened clinical suspicion and an accurate, prompt diagnosis of instability is of paramount importance in this athletic group. It dictates appropriate treatment of the condition, avoids treatment delays and failure, provides better outcomes, and ensures timely return to play. UPS and MDI are two forms of this diagnosis. In UPS, patients at risk are young hyperlax athletes with a history of direct trauma or forceful overextension of the shoulder. They have shoulder pain that is described as deep anterior, reproduced with an anterior apprehension test and relieved with a relocation test. Soft tissue and/or bony lesions consistent with instability (observed on imaging or at arthroscopy) are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of UPS. Once the diagnosis is made, standard arthroscopic techniques with labrum reinsertion and/or anteroinferior capsule plication can lead to predictable good results and return to sport. In MDI, patients at risk are also young hyperlax athletes. However, these patients often do not have a history of trauma. They have shoulder pain that is often somewhat vague in location and is reproduced with a sulcus and/or hyper abduction test. Soft tissue and/or bony lesions consistent with instability are uncommon, with the exception of capsular laxity. The mainstay of treatment is physiotherapy rehabilitation. When surgery is necessary, open capsular shift and arthroscopic capsular plication are effective.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the effectiveness of two home-based exercise programs for treating multidirectional shoulder instability (MDI) in patients diagnosed with Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) or Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders (HSD). METHODS: Twenty-one hEDS/HSD patients with MDI were recruited from the Center for Medical Genetics of the Ghent University Hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group. Both groups received a 6-month home-based exercise program. The primary outcome measure was the Western Ontario Shoulder Index (WOSI). Secondary outcomes included the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), Global Rating of Change (GROC), and pain pressure thresholds. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 6\,weeks, 12\,weeks, and 24\,weeks. RESULTS: Significant main effects for time were observed for all questionnaires, except for the TSK (p\,=\,0.12). Patients improved 240 and 325 points on the WOSI after 12 (p\,=\,0.02) and 24\,weeks (p\,=\,0.001), respectively. Additionally, patients improved 8.6 points on the DASH (p\,=\,0.002), 4.3 points on the PSFS (p\,=\,0.01), and 1.02 points on the GROC (p\,=\,0.001) after 24\,weeks. CONCLUSION: No significant differences were found between group A and B. Both home-based exercise programs led to significant improvements in shoulder function. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONHome-based exercise therapy may be effective for treating MDI in the hEDS/HSD population.Home-based training is beneficial for improving shoulder function, but a multidisciplinary, supervised approach might be more effective for altering kinesiophobia in this patient population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Close Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test (CKCUES test) is a low cost shoulder functional test that could be considered as a complementary and objective clinical outcome for shoulder performance evaluation. However, its reliability was tested only in recreational athletes' males and there are no studies comparing scores between sedentary and active samples. The purpose was to examine inter and intrasession reliability of CKCUES Test for samples of sedentary male and female with (SIS), for samples of sedentary healthy male and female, and for male and female samples of healthy upper extremity sport specific recreational athletes. Other purpose was to compare scores within sedentary and within recreational athletes samples of same gender. METHODS: A sample of 108 subjects with and without SIS was recruited. Subjects were tested twice, seven days apart. Each subject performed four test repetitions, with 45 seconds of rest between them. The last three repetitions were averaged and used to statistical analysis. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient ICC2,1 was used to assess intrasession reliability of number of touches score and ICC2,3 was used to assess intersession reliability of number of touches, normalized score, and power score. Test scores within groups of same gender also were compared. Measurement error was determined by calculating the Standard Error of the Measurement (SEM) and Minimum detectable change (MDC) for all scores. RESULTS: The CKCUES Test showed excellent intersession reliability for scores in all samples. Results also showed excellent intrasession reliability of number of touches for all samples. Scores were greater in active compared to sedentary, with exception of power score. All scores were greater in active compared to sedentary and SIS males and females. SEM ranged from 1.45 to 2.76 touches (based on a 95\% CI) and MDC ranged from 2.05 to 3.91(based on a 95\% CI) in subjects with and without SIS. At least three touches are needed to be considered a real improvement on CKCUES Test scores. CONCLUSION: Results suggest CKCUES Test is a reliable tool to evaluate upper extremity functional performance for sedentary, for upper extremity sport specific recreational, and for sedentary males and females with SIS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most commonly recommended treatment for multidirectional instability (MDI) of the glenohumeral joint is exercise-based management. The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise-based management in patients with MDI. The secondary aim was to observe the types of exercise protocols and outcomes used, as well as any adverse results associated with exercise. METHODS: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Medline, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PEDro, Current Contents, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), Australasian Medical Index (AMI), Ausport, and Clinical Trials Registers were searched for published and unpublished studies from the inception date to June 2012 using the keywords multidirectional instability, glenohumeral, and exercise. Selection criteria included all study designs (except case reports and case series) and participants with clinically diagnosed MDI using exercise-based management. Inclusion criteria were not limited by outcomes. The authors' own risk-of-bias tool was used for quality assessment of studies. The GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to synthesize the evidence. RESULTS: The risk of bias was high in all 7 included studies. For before-and-after comparisons of exercise-based management, GRADE assessment showed very low-quality evidence for improvements in shoulder kinematics, the Rowe score, overall status rating, and peak muscle strength. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of exercise-based management on MDI was variable across the included studies because of study heterogeneity and a high level of bias. There is a need for high-quality intervention studies to be undertaken to validate the effect of exercise for MDI.},

This review was performed to identify the scores most commonly used and to evaluate them according to the 4 core domains of shoulder trials (according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [COMET] initiative) and their respective psychometric qualities. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature of 3 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed) was undertaken. Studies were identified using eligibility criteria and critically appraised by 2 authors. Data were extracted using an a priori template. Outcome scores were identified and assessed regarding COMET domain inclusion and their psychometric properties. RESULTS: The most frequently used scores were the Rowe (58\%), Constant (33\%), Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI; 24\%), and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (23\%) scores. The majority of outcome scores assessed pain and all assessed physical functioning. Quality of life and a global assessment of treatment success were rarely incorporated. No single outcome score considered all core COMET domains. The WOSI was the most acceptable measure of those assessed with respect to its validity, reliability, and responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The WOSI incorporated 3 of the 4 core domains for shoulder trials (pain, physical functioning, and health-related quality of life). It had the most psychometric testing of the identified scores, confirming its reliability, validity, and responsiveness in the setting of shoulder instability. We recommend its use in this setting; however, it should be supplemented with additional outcome scores, such as the University of California-Los Angeles score, to cover all of the core COMET domains.},

Disruption of this interplay or poor development of any of these factors may result in instability, pain, and a loss of function. Rehabilitation will vary based on the type of instability present and the key principles described. Whether a course of nonoperative rehabilitation is followed or the patient presents postoperatively, a comprehensive program designed to establish full ROM and balance capsular mobility, in addition to maximizing muscular strength, endurance, proprioception, dynamic stability, and neuromuscular control is essential. A functional approach to rehabilitation using movement patterns and sport-specific positions along with an interval sport program will allow a gradual return to athletics. The focus of the program should minimize the risk of recurrence and ensure that the patient can safely return to functional activities.},
