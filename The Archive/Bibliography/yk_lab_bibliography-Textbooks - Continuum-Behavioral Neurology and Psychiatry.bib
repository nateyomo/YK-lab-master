  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Up to 80\% of survivors of right brain stroke leave acute care without being diagnosed with a major invisible disability. Studies indicate that a generic cognitive neurologic evaluation does not reliably detect spatial neglect, nor does it identify unawareness of deficit after right brain stroke; this article reviews the symptoms, clinical presentation, and management of these two cognitive disorders occurring after right brain stroke.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Stroke and occupational therapy practice guidelines stress a quality standard for spatial neglect assessment and treatment to reduce adverse outcomes for patients, their families, and society. Neurologists may attribute poor outcomes associated with spatial neglect to stroke severity. However, people with spatial neglect are half as likely to return to home and community, have one-third the community mobility, and require 3 times as much caregiver supervision compared with similar stroke survivors. Multiple randomized trials support a feasible first-line rehabilitation approach for spatial neglect: prism adaptation therapy; more than 20 studies reported that this treatment improves daily life independence. Evidence-based treatment of anosognosia is not as developed; however, treatment for this problem is also available.                                         SUMMARY               This article guides neurologists' assessment of right brain cognitive disorders and describes how to efficiently assemble and direct a treatment team to address spatial neglect and unawareness of deficit.},

Key aspects of the pathophysiology, signs, and symptoms, treatment and rehabilitation, and recovery from concussion/mild TBI are reviewed with an emphasis on the variety of factors that may contribute to cognitive concerns following injury.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms that occur in the immediate aftermath of an applied force and in the hours, days, and weeks thereafter. Although advances have been made in advanced diagnostics, including neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers in hopes of developing objective indicators of injury, such markers currently lack sufficient specificity to be used in clinical diagnostics. The symptoms of concussion are heterogeneous and may be seen to form subtypes, each of which suggests a targeted rehabilitation by the interdisciplinary team. Although the majority of patients with concussion recover within the first 30 to 90 days after injury, some have persistent disabling symptoms. The concept of                 postconcussion syndrome                 , implying a chronic syndrome of injury-specific symptoms, is replaced by a broader concept of                 persistent symptoms after concussion                 . This concept emphasizes the fact that most persistent symptoms have their basis in complex somatic, cognitive, psychiatric, and psychosocial factors related to risk and resilience. This framework leads to the important conclusion that concussion is a treatable injury from which nearly all patients can be expected to recover.                                                        SUMMARY               Concussion/mild TBI is a significant public health problem in civilian, military, and organized athletic settings. Recent advances have led to a better understanding of underlying pathophysiology and symptom presentation and efficacious treatment and rehabilitation of the resulting symptoms. An interdisciplinary team is well-positioned to provide problem-oriented, integrated care to facilitate recovery and to advance the evidence base supporting effective practice in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.},

These disorders are not merely historical curiosities, however. As apraxia, neglect, and agnosia have important clinical implications, it is important to possess a working knowledge of the conditions and how to identify them.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Apraxia is a disorder of skilled action that is frequently observed in the setting of dominant hemisphere pathology, whether from stroke or neurodegenerative disorders. In contrast to some previous teaching, apraxia has clear clinical relevance as it is associated with poor recovery from stroke. Neglect is a complex disorder with many different manifestations that may have different underlying mechanisms. Neglect is, in the author's view, a multicomponent disorder in which impairment in attention and arousal is a major contributor. Finally, agnosias come in a wide variety of forms, reflecting impairments ranging from low-level sensory processing to access to stored knowledge of the world (semantics).                                         SUMMARY               The classic behavioral disorders reviewed here were of immense interest to early neurologists because of their arresting clinical phenomenology; more recent investigations have done much to advance the neuroscientific understanding of the disorders and to reveal their clinical relevance.},

It highlights the primary mood disorders and secondary neurologic causes of mood disorders that are commonly encountered in a clinical setting. As the literature and our understanding evolve, recent additions to the current literature are important to bring forth to the readers.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advancements in clinical medicine have strengthened our understanding of the associations of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. This article highlights the medications frequently used with newly identified mood disorders and the common side effects of these medications. A paradigm shift has moved toward newer treatment modalities, such as the use of ketamine, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and complementary and alternative medicine. The risks and benefits of such therapies, along with medications, are reviewed in this article.

The importance and sequelae of lifetime trauma burden are discussed, with reference to trends in prevention, early intervention, and treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                PTSD has different clinical phenotypes, which are reflected in the changes in                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 (                 DSM-5                 ) criteria. PTSD is almost always complicated by comorbidity. Treatment requires a multimodal approach, usually including medication, different therapeutic techniques, and management of comorbidity. Interest is growing in the neurobiology of childhood survivors of trauma, intergenerational transmission of trauma, and long-term impact of trauma on physical health. Mitigation of the risk of PTSD pretrauma in the military and first responders is gaining momentum, given concerns about the cost and disability associated with PTSD. Interest is also growing in screening for PTSD in medical populations, with evidence of improved clinical outcomes. Preliminary research supports the treatment of PTSD with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.                                                        SUMMARY               PTSD is a trauma-related disorder with features of fear and negative thinking about the trauma and the future. Untreated, it leads to ongoing disruption of life due to avoidance, impaired vocational and social functioning, and other symptoms, depending on the phenotype. Despite a theoretical understanding of underlying mechanisms, PTSD remains challenging to treat, although evidence exists for benefit of pharmacologic agents and trauma-focused therapies. A need still remains for treatments that are more effective and efficient, with faster onset.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Two important changes have been made to the recent                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 (                 DSM-5                 ) diagnostic criteria: the criteria that conversion symptoms must be shown to be involuntary and occurring as the consequence of a recent stressor have been dropped. Outcome studies show that the rate of misdiagnosis has declined precipitously since the 1970s and is now around 4\%. Functional neuroimaging has revealed a fairly consistent pattern of hypoactivation in brain regions linked to the specific conversion symptom, accompanied by ancillary activations in limbic, paralimbic, and basal ganglia structures. Cognitive-behavioral therapy looks promising as the psychological treatment of choice, although more definitive data are still awaited, while preliminary evidence indicates that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation could prove beneficial as well.                                                        SUMMARY               Symptoms of conversion are common in neurologic and psychiatric settings, affecting up to 20\% of patients. The full syndrome of conversion disorder, while less prevalent, is associated with a guarded prognosis and a troubled psychosocial outcome. Much remains uncertain with respect to etiology, although advances in neuroscience and technology are providing reproducible findings and new insights. Given the confidence with which the diagnosis can be made, treatment should not be delayed, as symptom longevity can influence outcome.},

RECENT FINDINGS               As updated methods become available to neurologists, the ability to accurately identify and treat patients with memory disorders evolves. An appreciation of current concepts in the anatomic, physiologic, and psychological aspects of memory, combined with a rational application of everyday tools (such as clinical examination, bedside testing, standardized cognitive screening, and formal neuropsychological examination), allows the clinician to identify possible etiologies and track longitudinal changes in functional memory status. Recent findings regarding the interactions of limbic, anterior temporal, primary sensory, parietal, and dorsal prefrontal structures shed new light on the putative classifications of procedural and declarative memory and their subfunctions.                                         SUMMARY               An understanding of memory profiles pertaining to registration, encoding, consolidation, storage, and retrieval, as well as methods to assess those functions, facilitates the clinician's identification of underlying pathology and affected cerebral territories. The memory profile must be appreciated in the context of the entire individual, including possible confounds of comorbid conditions, psychiatric disorders, and normal healthy aging.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Despite the ubiquity of anxiety, the evidence is that most individuals with an anxiety disorder are not identified and do not receive guideline-level care. In part, this may be because of the manifold clinical presentations of anxiety disorders and clinicians' lack of confidence in accurately diagnosing and treating these conditions, especially in nonpsychiatric settings. Anxiety disorders represent the complex interplay between biological, psychological, temperamental, and environmental factors. Converging lines of evidence point to dysfunction in regulating activity in the ``threat circuit'' in the brain as a putative common pathophysiology underlying anxiety disorders. Evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressant medications, have been shown to regulate activity in this circuit, which consists of reciprocal connections between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and amygdala.                                         SUMMARY               Anxiety disorders are the most common class of emotional disorders and a leading cause of disability worldwide. A variety of effective treatment strategies are available, which may exert their therapeutic benefits from top-down or bottom-up modulation of the dysfunctional brain activity associated with anxiety disorders.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Our understanding of memory formation advances each year. Successful episodic memory formation depends not only on intact medial temporal lobe structures but also on well-orchestrated interactions with other large-scale brain networks that support executive and semantic processing functions. Recent discoveries of cognitive control networks have helped in understanding the interaction between memory systems and executive systems. These interactions allow access to past experiences and enable comparisons between past experiences and external and internal information. The semantic memory system is less clearly defined anatomically. Anterior, lateral, and inferior temporal lobe regions appear to play a crucial role in the function of the semantic processing system. Different but tightly interconnected cortical regions, such as the prefrontal region, may play a controlling role in this system. The presentation of clinical disease affecting memory is the result of the selective vulnerability of the memory system. An understanding of current concepts of memory anatomy, physiology, and evaluation plays a central role in establishing an accurate diagnosis.                                         SUMMARY               Different memory systems rely on separate but overlapping distributed brain networks. Certain pathologic processes preferentially affect memory systems.

SUMMARY               This article guides clinicians in testing for and diagnosing the different forms of upper limb apraxia, identifying the underlying diseases that may cause apraxia, managing the different forms of the disorder, and possible forms of rehabilitation.},

This article reviews these processes and the underlying neuroanatomy and provides an approach to the assessment of prefrontal lobe functions at the bedside.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive and behavioral frontal lobe functions are mediated by the prefrontal regions rather than the frontal lobes as a whole. At least five separate prefrontal functions have been defined: energization, task setting, monitoring, behavioral/emotional regulation, and metacognition. Energization is mediated by the superior medial prefrontal cortices bilaterally, task setting by the left lateral frontal cortex, monitoring by the right lateral prefrontal cortex, behavioral/emotional regulation by the orbitofrontal cortex, and metacognition by the frontal poles. Only task setting and monitoring are considered executive functions.                                         SUMMARY               Distinct cognitive and behavioral processes are mediated by different parts of the frontal lobe. Lesions in these areas result in characteristic clinical deficits that are discussed in this article. Key messages are that prefrontal regions mediate the higher cortical functions (as opposed to the frontal lobes in general) and that prefrontal functions are not equivalent to executive functions.},

The clinical manifestations of lesions to the lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal, and frontopolar cortex are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Traditional lesion studies have emphasized the role of a brain region in controlling a cognitive function. With advances in neurology, neuropsychology, and neuroimaging, the participation of the prefrontal cortex in large-scale networks has been established with recognition that cognitive dysfunction can arise not only from a lesion within a network but also from degenerative disease targeting these large-scale, dynamic neural networks. Although executive dysfunction can result from frontal lobe injury, this article highlights the role of distributed processes subserving executive functions. An atypical phenotype of Alzheimer disease has been described that selectively targets parietal-temporal-frontal networks important for core executive functions.                                         SUMMARY               Executive function comprises working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition and depends on top-down (ie, goal-driven) control of distributed processes occurring throughout the brain. The exact behavioral output (ie, function) depends on the content of the processes being controlled. Prefrontal cortex regions serve key cognitive functions related to social, emotional, and motivational aspects of behavior. The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in working memory, goal-driven attention, task switching, planning, problem-solving, and novelty-seeking. The ventral lateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in inhibition, response selection, and monitoring; the medial prefrontal cortex in self-knowledge, motivation, emotional regulation, and updating goal-directed behavior; the orbitofrontal cortex in personality, inhibition, and emotional and social reasoning. Although dysexecutive syndromes have been traditionally associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex injury, it is now recognized that they can also result from an impaired parietal-temporal-frontal system, which is targeted in a distinct form of atypical Alzheimer disease. This dysexecutive Alzheimer phenotype is characterized by impaired task performance on a wide battery of neuropsychological tests and simple daily tasks that require executive control. In contrast, dysexecutive syndromes more localized to the frontal lobe involve impaired executive control of social, emotional, and motivational aspects of behavior.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Emerging evidence supports significant connections between psychosis and structural and functional brain changes in both primary psychotic and neurologic disorders. In addition to antidopaminergic activity, the mechanism of new-generation antipsychotics shifts to act on serotonin receptors, which potentially contributes to their benefits in the treatment of negative symptoms of psychosis and a lesser frequency of extrapyramidal side effects compared with typical antipsychotics. This is also helpful in the treatment of psychosis in patients who have neurodegenerative diseases and are vulnerable to developing extrapyramidal side effects from typical antipsychotics.                                         SUMMARY               Even with significant overlap, management of psychosis in primary psychotic disorders differs from the approach of psychosis in neurologic diseases.

Guidance for effectively identifying obsessive-compulsive symptoms is provided, and treatment options, including psychotherapy, pharmacologic management, and neuromodulation approaches for treatment-resistant OCD, are discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                OCD affects 2\% to 3\% of adults worldwide and is associated with substantial individual disability and societal costs. Lack of recognition of common OCD symptom types, in addition to shame and fear of stigma on the part of patients, has created an average delay in diagnosis by almost 10 years and a delay in effective treatment (ie, a treatment gap) of nearly 2 years. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically a form of CBT that includes a type of behavioral intervention called                 exposure and response prevention                 , remains the most effective form of treatment for OCD. If CBT is not effective or not available, pharmacologic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or clomipramine, a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, can also be of benefit. Neuromodulation approaches such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation are rapidly emerging as effective treatments for OCD, particularly for patients who have not experienced an adequate response to psychotherapy or pharmacologic management.                                                        SUMMARY               OCD affects more than one in every 50 adults in the United States but is recognized and adequately treated in fewer than half of those affected. Early intervention and appropriate treatment can substantially reduce OCD symptom severity, improve quality of life, and minimize the functional disability associated with this chronic and often debilitating illness.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Ongoing research, building on landmark work regarding parallel distributed processing (PDP), provides the basis for understanding cognitive functions as a manifestation of the activity of populations of millions or billions of neurons in various highly interconnected networks. Population encoding networks have the following intrinsic properties that provide an orderly explanation for normal and degraded language: (1) a capacity for settling into stable ``attractor'' states; (2) processing occurs in and knowledge (long-term memories) is stored in exactly the same network; (3) a capacity for incorporating statistical regularities of experience, frequency, and age of acquisition; (4) support of content-addressable memory; and (5) graceful degradation, such that lesions increase the probability of errors but do not fundamentally transform network operations. Knowledge in parallel distributed processing networks resides in the strength of connections between units (synapses in the brain). Aphasia, whether stemming from stroke or dementing disorders, can be understood in terms of the degradation of one or more domains of knowledge.

RECENT FINDINGS               With a lifetime prevalence estimated at 2.5\%, OCD is a common condition that can also present comorbidly with neurologic disease. The core symptoms of OCD are obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive repetitive thoughts, urges, images, or impulses that trigger anxiety and that the individual is not able to suppress. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts occurring in response to an obsession with the intention of reducing the distress caused by obsessions. Neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and pharmacologic studies suggest that the expression of OCD symptoms is associated with dysfunction in a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit. Evidence-based treatments for OCD comprise pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line drugs recommended for OCD, but significant differences exist in their use for OCD compared to their use for other mood and anxiety conditions, including the need for higher dosage, longer trials necessitated by a longer lag for therapeutic response, and typically lower response rates. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, based on the principles of exposure and response prevention, shows results superior to pharmacologic treatments with lower relapse rates on long-term follow-up and thus should be considered in the treatment plan of every patient with OCD.

Epidemiologic and neurobiological data are reviewed as well as common associated symptoms, including sleep disruption, and treatment approaches to these conditions.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                PTSD is no longer considered an anxiety-related disorder in the                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 classification and instead is associated with trauma/stressor-related disorders. PTSD symptoms are clustered into four domains including intrusive experiences, avoidance, mood, and arousal symptoms. Despite this reclassification, similarities exist in consideration of diagnosis, treatment, and comorbidities with anxiety disorders. PTSD and anxiety-related disorders are heterogeneous, which is reflected by the neural circuits involved in the genesis of symptoms that may vary across symptom domains. Treatment is likely to benefit from consideration of this heterogeneity.                              Research in animal models of fear and anxiety, as well as in humans, suggests that patients with PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder have difficulty accurately determining safety from danger and struggle to suppress fear in the presence of safety cues.               Empirically supported psychotherapies commonly involved exposure (fear extinction learning) and are recommended for PTSD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been shown to be effective in other anxiety-related disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly used in the treatment of PTSD and anxiety disorders in which pharmacologic intervention is supported. Treating sleep disruption including sleep apnea (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]), nightmares, and insomnia (preferably via psychotherapy) may improve symptoms of PTSD, as well as improve mood in anxiety disorders.                                         SUMMARY               PTSD has a lifetime prevalence that is close to 10\% and shares neurobiological features with anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are the most common class of mental conditions and are highly comorbid with other disorders; treatment considerations typically include cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacologic intervention. Developing technologies show some promise as treatment alternatives in the future.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article reviews the treatment of aggression and agitation in dementia. Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to responsive behaviors are discussed. Practical treatment strategies are applied to common behavioral symptoms.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Aggressive and agitated behavior is common in dementia. Behavioral symptoms lead to reduced quality of life and distress for both patients and caregivers. They can also lead to poor outcomes and are associated with significant financial implications for the individual and health care system. A wide range of difficult behaviors exists, with limited evidence for deciding on treatment. Clinicians should integrate the available evidence with practical and commonsense strategies to target these difficult-to-treat behaviors.                                         SUMMARY               Treating aggression and agitation in dementia is challenging. Viewing behaviors as a response to either internal or external stimuli can help guide treatment. Treatment should emphasize nonpharmacologic approaches as an initial step, using practical and commonsense strategies. Caregivers and family should be actively involved in the planning and implementation of behavioral plans. It is essential to minimize both medical and nonmedical factors that may be contributing to behaviors. When pharmacologic options are required, it is important to choose medications that will target specific behavioral goals, having both practical consideration and the best evidence in mind.},
