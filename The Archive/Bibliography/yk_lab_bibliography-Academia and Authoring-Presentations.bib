  abstract = {Good presentation skills are important. Why? When you improve your presentation skills, you improve your ability to engage your audience and communicate whatever science you happen to do. In graduate school you learn how to do research, and you sometimes learn how to teach, but how often do you actually learn how to give an effective, engaging presentation? In this personal view I recount some of my early experiences as a presenter and some of the techniques I use to (hopefully) engage my audiences.},
