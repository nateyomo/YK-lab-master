  abstract = {Adults commonly present to their family physicians with hip pain, and diagnosing the cause is important for prescribing effective therapy. Hip pain is usually located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. Anterior hip pain includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes; extra-articular etiologies, such as hip flexor injuries; and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or osteoarthritis in older adults. Lateral hip pain is most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction. Posterior hip pain includes referred pain such as lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy. In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Because femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Iliotibial band (ITB) syndrome is a common overuse injury in runners and cyclists. It is regarded as a friction syndrome where the ITB rubs against (and `rolls over') the lateral femoral epicondyle. Here, we re-evaluate the clinical anatomy of the region to challenge the view that the ITB moves antero-posteriorly over the epicondyle. Gross anatomical and microscopical studies were conducted on the distal portion of the ITB in 15 cadavers. This was complemented by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of six asymptomatic volunteers and studies of two athletes with acute ITB syndrome. In all cadavers, the ITB was anchored to the distal femur by fibrous strands, associated with a layer of richly innervated and vascularized fat. In no cadaver, volunteer or patient was a bursa seen. The MR scans showed that the ITB was compressed against the epicondyle at 30{$^\circ$} of knee flexion as a consequence of tibial internal rotation, but moved laterally in extension. MR signal changes in the patients with ITB syndrome were present in the region occupied by fat, deep to the ITB. The ITB is prevented from rolling over the epicondyle by its femoral anchorage and because it is a part of the fascia lata. We suggest that it creates the illusion of movement, because of changing tension in its anterior and posterior fibres during knee flexion. Thus, on anatomical grounds, ITB overuse injuries may be more likely to be associated with fat compression beneath the tract, rather than with repetitive friction as the knee flexes and extends.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal management of a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 121 young, active adults with acute ACL injury in which we compared two strategies: structured rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and structured rehabilitation with the option of later ACL reconstruction if needed. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 2 years in the average score on four subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)--pain, symptoms, function in sports and recreation, and knee-related quality of life (KOOS(4); range of scores, 0 [worst] to 100 [best]). Secondary outcomes included results on all five KOOS subscales, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and the score on the Tegner Activity Scale. RESULTS: Of 62 subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, 1 did not undergo surgery. Of 59 assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction, 23 underwent delayed ACL reconstruction; the other 36 underwent rehabilitation alone. The absolute change in the mean KOOS(4) score from baseline to 2 years was 39.2 points for those assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and 39.4 for those assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed reconstruction (absolute between-group difference, 0.2 points; 95\% confidence interval, -6.5 to 6.8; P=0.96 after adjustment for the baseline score). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups with respect to secondary outcomes. Adverse events were common in both groups. The results were similar when the data were analyzed according to the treatment actually received. CONCLUSIONS: In young, active adults with acute ACL tears, a strategy of rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction was not superior to a strategy of rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction. The latter strategy substantially reduced the frequency of surgical reconstructions.

Follow-up time ranged from one to five years, with a mean of 2.5 years. Symptoms mimicking the well known iliotibial band (ITB) friction syndrome were observed in 77 knees (7.2\%). Initial conservative treatment consisted of anti-inflammatory medication (77 knees) and local steroid injection (35 knees). The pain persisted in 22 knees (2\%), leading to a surgical release of the iliotibial band. Other surgical interventions included revision for infection (6 knees, 0.5\%), revision for tibial component loosening (6 knees, 0.5\%), revision for tibiofemoral dislocation (3 knees, 0.3\%), revision for patellar component loosening (5 knees, 0.4\%), revision for instability (1 knee, 0.1\%) and secondary patellar resurfacing (1 knee, 0.1\%). The overall survivorship with partial or total implant revision as an endpoint was 98\%. The development of lateral knee pain in association with the use of a guided motion design can be explained by the forced posterior translation of the lateral condyle in flexion. The asymmetric cam and post mechanism, acting as a hard driver of posterior femoral translation and internal tibial rotation during flexion, does not allow for the natural kinematic variability occurring in native knees. This repetitive and forced stretching of the ITB seems to induce a painful traction syndrome in some patients.},

High speed videography (200 fps), a force platform (500 Hz), and a Cybex II+ isokinetic dynamometer were used to assess rearfoot motion, ground reaction forces, and knee muscular strength and endurance, respectively. A linear discriminant function analysis of the training data revealed weekly mileage, training pace, number of months using current training protocol, \% time spent swimming, and \% time spent running on a track to be significant (P {$<$} 0.10). Height was a significant anthropometric discriminator, while seven isokinetic strength and endurance measures were found to discriminate significantly between the groups. Calcaneal to vertical touchdown angle, and maximum supination velocity were significant rearfoot movement discriminators. Maximum braking force was the only significant kinetic discriminator. A combined discriminant analysis using those variables found to be significant in the previous analyses revealed weekly mileage, and maximum normalized braking force to be the best discriminators (model P {$<$} 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

DESIGN: We reviewed high level athletes with an anterior cruciate ligament rupture on either MRI or arthroscopic evaluation more than 10 years previously, who were treated conservatively. They were pair-matched with patients who had had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patella-tendon-bone, with respect to age, gender and Tegner activity score before injury. PARTICIPANTS: In total 50 patients were pair-matched. RESULTS: We found no statistical difference between the patients treated conservatively or operatively with respect to osteoarthritis or meniscal lesions of the knee, as well as activity level, objective and subjective functional outcome. The patients who were treated operatively had a significantly better stability of the knee at examination. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the instability repair using a bone-patella-tendon-bone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a good knee stabilising operation. Both treatment options however show similar patient outcome at 10 year follow up.},

METHODS: A population-based study was performed within Olmstead County Minnesota, from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1999. MP incidence and its association with age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and DM were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 262 patients with MP, 262 normal controls, and 262 BMI-matched normal controls with mean age of 50 years were identified (51\% men). The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of MP was 32.6 per 100,000 patient years, whereas the incidence of MP in people with DM was 247 per 100,000 patient years, 7 times the occurrence of MP in the general population. Of the patients with MP, 28\% had DM vs 17\% of BMI-matched controls and the majority of people with MP developed DM after the diagnosis of MP. Patients with MP are 2 times more likely to develop DM (odds ratio 2, 95\% confidence interval 1.3-3.0, p = 0.0027). The mean BMI of patients with MP (30.1 kg/m(2), obese class I) was significantly higher than that of age- and gender-matched controls (27.3 kg/m(2), overweight). MP incidence increased 12.9 per 100,000 patient years in the hemidecade study period with an associated increase in both BMI (2.2 kg/m(2)) and average age (3 years). CONCLUSIONS: MP is a frequent painful neuropathy associated with obesity, advancing age, and DM. The incidence rate of MP is predicted to increase as these demographics increase in world populations. Because MP associates with DM beyond weight- and age-matched controls, more aggressive counseling of these patients in prevention of DM may be warranted.},

Due to the high degree of variability in their presentation and outcomes, treatment must be tailored according to factors such as patient demographics, the severity of the damage, and long-term improvement profile. When it comes to ACL injuries, low-quality data have been produced that reveals no difference in patient-reported knee function results between surgical ACL restoration and conservative therapy. However, these results must be evaluated in the perspective of the fact that many individuals with an ACL rupture remained symptomatic after rehabilitation and eventually underwent ACL reconstruction surgery. This article has reviewed the risk factors and the mechanisms that commonly lead to ACL injuries.
