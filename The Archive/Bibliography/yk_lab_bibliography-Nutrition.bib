  abstract = {This study included the following experiments: (1) effects of dextrose solution (250 mL of water containing 75 g of dextrose) or honey solution (250 mL of water containing 75 g of natural honey) on plasma glucose level (PGL), plasma insulin, and plasma C-peptide (eight subjects); (2) effects of dextrose, honey, or artificial honey (250 mL of water containing 35 g of dextrose and 40 g of fructose) on cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) (nine subjects); (3) effects of honey solution, administered for 15 days, on PGL, blood lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine (eight subjects); (4) effects of honey or artificial honey on cholesterol and TG in six patients with hypercholesterolemia and five patients with hypertriglyceridemia; (5) effects of honey for 15 days on blood lipid and CRP in five patients with elevated cholesterol and CRP; (6) effects of 70 g of dextrose or 90 g of honey on PGL in seven patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus; and (7) effects of 30 g of sucrose or 30 g of honey on PGL, plasma insulin, and plasma C-peptide in five diabetic patients. In healthy subjects, dextrose elevated PGL at 1 (53\%) and 2 (3\%) hours, and decreased PGL after 3 hours (20\%). Honey elevated PGL after 1 hour (14\%) and decreased it after 3 hours (10\%). Elevation of insulin and C-peptide was significantly higher after dextrose than after honey. Dextrose slightly reduced cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) after 1 hour and significantly after 2 hours, and increased TG after 1, 2, and 3 hours. Artificial honey slightly decreased cholesterol and LDL-C and elevated TG. Honey reduced cholesterol, LDL-C, and TG and slightly elevated high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Honey consumed for 15 days decreased cholesterol (7\%), LDL-C (1\%), TG (2\%), CRP (7\%), homocysteine (6\%), and PGL (6\%), and increased HDL-C (2\%). In patients with hypertriglyceridemia, artificial honey increased TG, while honey decreased TG. In patients with hyperlipidemia, artificial honey increased LDL-C, while honey decreased LDL-C. Honey decreased cholesterol (8\%), LDL-C (11\%), and CRP (75\%) after 15 days. In diabetic patients, honey compared with dextrose caused a significantly lower rise of PGL. Elevation of PGL was greater after honey than after sucrose at 30 minutes, and was lower after honey than it was after sucrose at 60, 120, and 180 minutes. Honey caused greater elevation of insulin than sucrose did after 30, 120, and 180 minutes. Honey reduces blood lipids, homocysteine, and CRP in normal and hyperlipidemic subjects. Honey compared with dextrose and sucrose caused lower elevation of PGL in diabetics.},

With regard to toxicological aspects, several studies suggest that phthalates would act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and they have been correlated to several forms of cancer. Since the analysis of PAEs in food is challenging, the aim of this study was the development of a simple and direct method, with no sample preparation (only dilution withsolvent), for the analysis of targeted phthalates in vegetable oils, by using cryogenic-modulation comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography combined with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The method was characterized by good repeatability values, limit of quantification values ranging between 0.06 and 2.10~mg/kg, accuracy values ranging from -9.2 to 10.4\%, and a matrix effectranging from -4 to 78\%.The developed technique was used for the analysis of 27 vegetable oils.},

Most recent meta-analyses of randomized trials and observational studies found no beneficial effects of reducing SFA intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality, and instead found protective effects against stroke. Although SFAs increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in most individuals, this is not due to increasing levels of small, dense LDL particles, but rather larger LDL particles, which are much less strongly related to CVD risk. It is also apparent that the health effects of foods cannot be predicted by their content in any nutrient group without considering the overall macronutrient distribution. Whole-fat dairy, unprocessed meat, and dark chocolate are SFA-rich foods with a complex matrix that are not associated with increased risk of CVD. The totality of available evidence does~not support further limiting the intake of such foods.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Falls among elderly individuals occur frequently, increase with age, and lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. The role of vitamin D in preventing falls among elderly people has not been well established. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of vitamin D in preventing an older person from falling. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from January 1960 to February 2004, EMBASE from January 1991 to February 2004, clinical experts, bibliographies, and abstracts. Search terms included trial terms: randomized-controlled trial or controlled-clinical trial or random-allocation or double-blind method, or single-blind method or uncontrolled-trials with vitamin D terms: cholecalciferol or hydroxycholecalciferols or calcifediol or dihydroxycholecalciferols or calcitriol or vitamin D/aa[analogs \& derivates] or ergocalciferol or vitamin D/bl[blood]; and with accidental falls or falls, and humans. STUDY SELECTION: We included only double-blind randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D in elderly populations (mean age, 60 years) that examined falls resulting from low trauma for which the method of fall ascertainment and definition of falls were defined explicitly. Studies including patients in unstable health states were excluded. Five of 38 identified studies were included in the primary analysis and 5 other studies were included in a sensitivity analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent extraction by 3 authors using predefined data fields including study quality indicators. DATA SYNTHESIS: Based on 5 RCTs involving 1237 participants, vitamin D reduced the corrected odds ratio (OR) of falling by 22\% (corrected OR, 0.78; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.92) compared with patients receiving calcium or placebo. From the pooled risk difference, the number needed to treat (NNT) was 15 (95\% CI, 8-53), or equivalently 15 patients would need to be treated with vitamin D to prevent 1 person from falling. The inclusion of 5 additional studies, involving 10 001 participants, in a sensitivity analysis resulted in a smaller but still significant effect size (corrected RR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.96). Subgroup analyses suggested that the effect size was independent of calcium supplementation, type of vitamin D, duration of therapy, and sex, but reduced sample sizes made the results statistically nonsignificant for calcium supplementation, cholecalciferol, and among men. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation appears to reduce the risk of falls among ambulatory or institutionalized older individuals with stable health by more than 20\%. Further studies examining the effect of alternative types of vitamin D and their doses, the role of calcium supplementation, and effects in men should be considered.},

  abstract = {Skin aging has become a recurring concern even for younger people, mainly owing to increased life expectancy. In this context, the use of nutricosmetics as supplements has increased in recent years. Moreover, numerous scientific studies have shown the benefits of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation in improving the signs of skin aging. The objective of this study was to summarize the evidence on the effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on human skin through a systematic review followed by a meta-analysis of clinical trials focusing on the process of skin aging. A literature search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, Cochrane, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), and Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine databases. Eligible studies were randomized, double-blind, and controlled trials that evaluated oral supplementation with hydrolyzed collagen as an intervention and reported at least one of the following outcomes: skin wrinkles, hydration, elasticity, and firmness. After retrieving articles from the databases, 19 studies were selected, with a total of 1,125 participants aged between 20 and 70\,years (95\% women). In the meta-analysis, a grouped analysis of studies showed favorable results of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation compared with placebo in terms of skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkles. The findings of improved hydration and elasticity were also confirmed in the subgroup meta-analysis. Based on results, ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen for 90\,days is effective in reducing skin aging, as it reduces wrinkles and improves skin elasticity and hydration.},

However, much of the human research has concentrated on chronic supplementation in cognitively compromised cohorts. OBJECTIVE: The current pilot study investigated the acute and chronic (28-day) cognitive and mood-enhancing effects of Hericium erinaceus in a healthy, young adult cohort. DESIGN: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups design investigated the acute (60 min post dose) and chronic (28-day intervention) effects of 1.8 g Hericium erinaceus in 41 healthy adults aged 18-45 years. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that following a single dose of Hericium erinaceus, participants performed quicker on the Stroop task (p = 0.005) at 60 min post dose. A trend towards reduced subjective stress was observed following 28-day supplementation (p = 0.051). CONCLUSIONS: The findings tentatively suggest that Hericium erinaceus may improve speed of performance and reduce subjective stress in healthy, young adults. However, null and limited negative findings were also observed. Given the small sample size, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Further investigation in larger sample sizes is crucial, however the findings of this trial offer a promising avenue of interest.},

Although medications may ease suffering for some, in Change Your Diet, Change Your Mind, Dr. Georgia Ede argues that the most powerful way to change brain chemistry is with food, because what we eat is where our brain's chemicals come from. For years, we've been told the way to protect our brains is through superfoods and supplements--we top our oatmeal with blueberries, choose plant-based patties over hamburgers, and wash down handfuls of supplements with green smoothies. But the science says: not only do these strategies fail people, but they can also work against them. The truth about brain food is that meat is not dangerous, vegan diets are not healthier, and antioxidants will not help you. In this provocative, illuminating book, Dr. Ede explains why everything we think we know about eating for neurological psychological well-being is wrong. Most of what we accept as true is based on studies that take an "outside-in" approach, making associations between healthy people and what they eat. In her book, Dr. Ede takes an inside-out stance, drawing on a range of disciplines like biochemistry, neuroscience, and botany to explain why a ketogenic diet combined with "kinder, gentler plant foods" is the best way to nourish, protect, and energize the brain"--},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Magnesium plays a key role in bone health and may, therefore, represent an interesting nutrient for the prevention of bone loss and osteoporosis. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the impact of magnesium intake from any source on bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), bone turnover markers, and fracture risk in older adults. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using Embase, Medline Ovid and Cochrane Central from database inception to October 2020. All studies that related magnesium intake with bone health outcomes among adults aged {$\geq$}60~years were included. Two investigators independently conducted abstract and full-text screenings, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments. Authors were contacted for missing data. RESULTS: Once 787 records were screened, six cohort studies, one case-control study and five cross-sectional studies were included. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated a positive trend between higher magnesium intake and higher hip and femoral neck BMD. Meta-analysis of four studies showed a significant positive association between magnesium intake and hip BMD (pooled beta: 0.03, 95\% CI: 0.01-0.06, p~{$<~$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review indicates that a higher magnesium intake may support an increase in hip and femoral neck BMD. Due to limited research no associations with BMD at other sites or fractures were found. There is a need for properly designed cohort studies to determine the association between magnesium intake and bone health in older adults. Next, large and long-term randomized controlled trials in older adults are needed to determine whether an increase in magnesium (supplementation) intake can improve bone health. The combination of several bone nutrients (calcium, vitamin D, protein, magnesium and potentially more) may be needed for the most optimal effect on bone health and to delay or prevent the development of osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {This article has been corrected. The original version (PDF) is appended to this article as a Supplement. BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence has continuously increased over the past few centuries and represents a major health burden worldwide. PURPOSE: To evaluate the possible causal relationship between intake of red and processed meat and cancer mortality and incidence. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest from inception until July 2018 and MEDLINE from inception until April 2019 without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies that included more than 1000 adults and reported the association between consumption of unprocessed red and processed meat and cancer mortality and incidence. DATA EXTRACTION: Teams of 2 reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias; 1 reviewer evaluated the certainty of evidence, which was confirmed or revised by the senior reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 118 articles (56 cohorts) with more than 6 million participants, 73 articles were eligible for the dose-response meta-analyses, 30 addressed cancer mortality, and 80 reported cancer incidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that an intake reduction of 3 servings of unprocessed meat per week was associated with a very small reduction in overall cancer mortality over a lifetime. Evidence of low to very low certainty suggested that each intake reduction of 3 servings of processed meat per week was associated with very small decreases in overall cancer mortality over a lifetime; prostate cancer mortality; and incidence of esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancer. LIMITATION: Limited causal inferences due to residual confounding in observational studies, risk of bias due to limitations in diet assessment and adjustment for confounders, recall bias in dietary assessment, and insufficient data for planned subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION: The possible absolute effects of red and processed meat consumption on cancer mortality and incidence are very small, and the certainty of evidence is low to very low.

Nutrients found in beef are associated with outcomes of wellbeing such as physical and cognitive function, lean body mass, and mood in older adults and individuals with chronic disease. However, it is unclear how beef and nutrients found in beef impact wellbeing in healthy adults {$\geq$}50~years of age. This study systematically reviewed evidence linking the intake of beef and nutrients found in beef to markers of wellbeing in healthy adults. PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched up to August 31, 2021 for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Nutrients included in the analysis were beef, red meat, dietary protein, essential amino acids, branched chain amino acids, tryptophan, arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, choline, zinc, and iron. We identified nine RCTs with results from 55 measurements of markers of wellbeing. An overall positive effect was found of beef and beef's nutrients on wellbeing. There was an overall positive effect of amino acids and protein on wellbeing, with no effect of arginine, vitamin B-12, leucine, and zinc. Physical function was also influenced by beef and nutrients found in beef. Eight of the studies found focused on specific nutrients found in beef, and not beef itself in older adults with one or more chronic diseases. This study identified a need for further research regarding the effect of beef and nutrients found in beef on defined functional outcomes of wellbeing in healthy adults {$\geq$}50~years of age.},

METHODS: Sixty-three cases of idiopathic constipation presenting between May 2008 and May 2010 were enrolled into the study after colonoscopy excluded an organic cause of the constipation. Patients with previous colon surgery or a medical cause of their constipation were excluded. All patients were given an explanation on the role of fiber in the gastrointestinal tract. They were then asked to go on a no fiber diet for 2 wk. Thereafter, they were asked to reduce the amount of dietary fiber intake to a level that they found acceptable. Dietary fiber intake, symptoms of constipation, difficulty in evacuation of stools, anal bleeding, abdominal bloating or abdominal pain were recorded at 1 and 6 mo. RESULTS: The median age of the patients (16 male, 47 female) was 47 years (range, 20-80 years). At 6 mo, 41 patients remained on a no fiber diet, 16 on a reduced fiber diet, and 6 resumed their high fiber diet for religious or personal reasons. Patients who stopped or reduced dietary fiber had significant improvement in their symptoms while those who continued on a high fiber diet had no change. Of those who stopped fiber completely, the bowel frequency increased from one motion in 3.75 d ({\textpm} 1.59 d) to one motion in 1.0 d ({\textpm} 0.0 d) (P {$<$} 0.001); those with reduced fiber intake had increased bowel frequency from a mean of one motion per 4.19 d ({\textpm} 2.09 d) to one motion per 1.9 d ({\textpm} 1.21 d) on a reduced fiber diet (P {$<$} 0.001); those who remained on a high fiber diet continued to have a mean of one motion per 6.83 d ({\textpm} 1.03 d) before and after consultation. For no fiber, reduced fiber and high fiber groups, respectively, symptoms of bloating were present in 0\%, 31.3\% and 100\% (P {$<$} 0.001) and straining to pass stools occurred in 0\%, 43.8\% and 100\% (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Idiopathic constipation and its associated symptoms can be effectively reduced by stopping or even lowering the intake of dietary fiber.},

We aimed to investigate the association of 2 year (2002-2003 to 2004-2005) change in cholesterol with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort study. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study population consisted of 269,391 participants aged more than 40 years who were free of myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort. Cholesterol levels were classified into 1st, 2nd and 3rd tertiles during each of the first and second health examinations, respectively. The participants were followed-up for all-cause and cause-specific mortality from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013. Compared to participants who stayed within the 2nd tertile group for cholesterol during both the first and second examinations, participants who became or maintained cholesterol levels to the 1st tertile during the second examination had increased risk of all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 1.28 (1.18-1.38) in 1st/1st, 1.16 (1.07-1.26) in 2nd/1st and 1.47 (1.32-1.64) in 3rd/1st tertile levels, respectively]. In addition, increased or persistent high cholesterol levels to the 3rd tertile was associated with elevated risk for all-cause mortality [aHR (95\% CI) = 1.10 (1.01-1.20) in 1st/2nd, 1.16(1.03-1.31) in 1st/3rd and 1.15(1.05-1.25) in 3rd/3rd tertile levels]. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in cholesterol levels in either direction to low cholesterol or persistently low cholesterol levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Particularly, spontaneous decline in cholesterol levels may be a marker for worsening health conditions.},

OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the effects of healthy diets that include small or large amounts of red meat on the maintenance of lost weight after successful weight loss, and secondarily on body composition (DXA), resting energy expenditure (REE; indirect calorimetry), and cardiometabolic risk factors. METHODS: In this 5-mo parallel randomized intervention trial, 108 adults with BMI 28-40~kg/m2 (45 males/63 females) underwent an 8-wk rapid weight loss period, and those who lost~{$\geq$}8\% body weight (n~=~80) continued to ad libitum weight maintenance diets for 12 wk: a moderate-protein diet with 25~g beef/d (B25, n~=~45) or a high-protein diet with 150~g beef/d (B150, n~=~35). RESULTS: In per protocol analysis (n~=~69), mean body weight (-1.2 kg; 95\% CI: -2.1, -0.3 kg), mean fat mass (-2.7 kg; 95\% CI: -3.4, -2.0 kg), and mean body fat content (-2.6\%; 95\% CI: -3.1, -2.1\%) decreased during the maintenance phase, whereas mean lean mass (1.5 kg; 95\% CI: 1.0, 2.0 kg) and mean REE (51 kcal/d; 95\% CI: 15, 86 kcal/d) increased, with no differences between groups (all P~{$>~$}0.05). Results were similar in intention-to-treat analysis with multiple imputation for dropouts (20 from B150 compared with 19 from B25, P~=~0.929). Changes in cardiometabolic risk factors were not different between groups, the general pattern being a decrease during weight loss and a return to baseline during weight maintenance (and despite the additional mild reduction in weight and fat mass). CONCLUSIONS: Healthy diets consumed ad libitum that contain a little or a lot of unprocessed beef have similar effects on body weight, energy metabolism, and cardiovascular risk factors during the first 3 mo after clinically significant rapid weight loss.},

  abstract = {The intake of linoleic acid (LA) has increased dramatically in the standard American diet. LA is generally promoted as supporting human health, but there exists controversy regarding whether the amount of LA currently consumed in the standard American diet supports human health. The goal of this narrative review is to explore the mechanisms that underlie the hypothesis that excessive LA intake may harm human health. While LA is considered to be an essential fatty acid and support health when consumed in modest amounts, an excessive intake of LA leads to the formation of oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OXLAMs), impairments in mitochondrial function through suboptimal cardiolipin composition, and likely contributes to many chronic diseases that became an epidemic in the 20th century, and whose prevalence continues to increase. The standard American diet comprises 14 to 25 times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 fatty acids, with the majority of omega-6 intake coming from LA. As LA consumption increases, the potential for OXLAM formation also increases. OXLAMs have been associated with various illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease, among others. Lowering dietary LA intake can help reduce the production and accumulation of OXLAMs implicated in chronic diseases. While there are other problematic components in the standard American diet, the half-life of LA is approximately two years, which means the damage can be far more persistent than other dietary factors, and the impact of reducing excessive LA intake takes time. Therefore, additional research-evaluating approaches to reduce OXLAM formation and cardiolipin derangements following LA consumption are warranted.},

Sensory evaluation scores of samples with celery powder, in fact, were comparable to those of CP during storage. The GSpB samples showed similar and higher values regarding the structural attributes, the related attribute to colour showed decidedly lower values due to a greenish coloration of the slice to the presence of spinach.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Results from observational studies suggest an association of red meat intake with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). However, results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not clearly supported a mechanistic link between red meat intake and T2D risk factors. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on RCTs evaluating the effects of diets containing red meat (beef, pork, lamb, etc.), compared to diets with lower or no red meat, on markers of glucose homeostasis in adults. METHODS: A search of PubMed and CENTRAL yielded 21 relevant RCTs. Pooled estimates were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs) between the red meat intervention and the comparator intervention with less or no red meat. RESULTS: Compared to diets with reduced or no red meat intake, there was no significant impact of red meat intake on insulin sensitivity (SMD: -0.11; 95\% CI: -0.39, 0.16), insulin resistance (SMD: 0.11; 95\% CI: -0.24, 0.45), fasting glucose (SMD: 0.13; 95\% CI: -0.04, 0.29), fasting insulin (SMD: 0.08; 95\% CI: -0.16, 0.32), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; SMD: 0.10; 95\% CI: -0.37, 0.58), pancreatic beta-cell function (SMD: -0.13; 95\% CI: -0.37, 0.10), or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1; SMD: 0.10; 95\% CI: -0.37, 0.58). Red meat intake modestly reduced postprandial glucose (SMD: -0.44; 95\% CI: -0.67, -0.22; P\,{$<$}\,0.001) compared to meals with reduced or no red meat intake. The quality of evidence was low to moderate for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis suggest red meat intake does not impact most glycemic and insulinemic risk factors for T2D. Further investigations are needed on other markers of glucose homeostasis to better understand whether a causal relationship exists between red meat intake and risk of T2D.

  abstract = {Consumers often wish to substitute refined sugar with alternative sweeteners, such as coconut sugar, given growing interest in healthy eating and the public's negative perception of excess sugar intake. Coconut sugar is a healthier, sweetener option than the majority of other sugars that are commercially available. Sap is collected from trees to be transported, stored, and evaporated during processing, which are labor- and resource-intensive operations. Consequently, the cost of production is higher than it is for cane sugar. Given its high nutritional value and low glycemic index, people are willing to pay higher prices for it. However, one barrier is ignorance of its health benefits. This review examines and deals in-depth with the most significant features of coconut sugar chemical analyses to focus on several analytical methodologies given the increasing demand for naturally derived sweeteners in the last 10 years. A deeper understanding of the quality control, safety, health effects, nutritional profile, and sustainability issues corresponding to coconut sugar is necessary to effectively implement them in the food industry.},

Estimates of associations of NHL with 21 pesticide chemical groups and 80 active ingredients were extracted from 44 papers, all of which reported results from analyses of studies conducted in high-income countries. Random effects meta-analyses showed that phenoxy herbicides, carbamate insecticides, organophosphorus insecticides and the active ingredient lindane, an organochlorine insecticide, were positively associated with NHL. In a handful of papers, associations between pesticides and NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicides and the organophosphorus herbicide glyphosate. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicide exposure. Despite compelling evidence that NHL is associated with certain chemicals, this review indicates the need for investigations of a larger variety of pesticides in more geographic areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which, despite producing a large portion of the world's agriculture, were missing in the literature that were reviewed.},

However, numerous highly publicized observational studies of the effect of prevention on health outcomes have reported exaggerated relationships that were later contradicted by randomized controlled trials. A growing body of research has identified sources of bias in observational studies that are related to patient behaviors or underlying patient characteristics, known as the healthy user effect, the healthy adherer effect, confounding by functional status or cognitive impairment, and confounding by selective prescribing. In this manuscript we briefly review observational studies of prevention that have appeared to reach incorrect conclusions. We then describe potential sources of bias in these studies and discuss study designs, analytical methods, and sensitivity analyses that may mitigate bias or increase confidence in the results reported. More careful consideration of these sources of bias and study designs by providers can enhance evidence-based decision-making.},

  abstract = {It is time to shift the arachidonic acid (ARA) paradigm from a harm-generating molecule to its status of polyunsaturated fatty acid essential for normal health. ARA is an integral constituent of biological cell membrane, conferring it with fluidity and flexibility, so necessary for the function of all cells, especially in nervous system, skeletal muscle, and immune system. Arachidonic acid is obtained from food or by desaturation and chain elongation of the plant-rich essential fatty acid, linoleic acid. Free ARA modulates the function of ion channels, several receptors and enzymes, via activation as well as inhibition. That explains its fundamental role in the proper function of the brain and muscles and its protective potential against Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium infection and tumor initiation, development, and metastasis. Arachidonic acid in cell membranes undergoes reacylation/deacylation cycles, which keep the concentration of free ARA in cells at a very low level and limit ARA availability to oxidation. Metabolites derived from ARA oxidation do not initiate but contribute to inflammation and most importantly lead to the generation of mediators responsible for resolving inflammation and wound healing. Endocannabinoids are oxidation-independent ARA derivatives, critically important for brain reward signaling, motivational processes, emotion, stress responses, pain, and energy balance. Free ARA and metabolites promote and modulate type 2 immune responses, which are critically important in resistance to parasites and allergens insult, directly via action on eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells and indirectly by binding to specific receptors on innate lymphoid cells. In conclusion, the present review advocates the innumerable ARA roles and considerable importance for normal health.},

However, several recent studies showed its potential adverse health effects to humans as it may be an endocrine disruptor. This study focuses on the effects of pure glyphosate on estrogen receptors (ERs) mediated transcriptional activity and their expressions. Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer, T47D cells, but not in hormone-independent breast cancer, MDA-MB231 cells, at 10{$^{-12}$} to 10{$^{-6}$}M in estrogen withdrawal condition. The proliferative concentrations of glyphosate that induced the activation of estrogen response element (ERE) transcription activity were 5-13 fold of control in T47D-KBluc cells and this activation was inhibited by an estrogen antagonist, ICI 182780, indicating that the estrogenic activity of glyphosate was mediated via ERs. Furthermore, glyphosate also altered both ER{$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} expression. These results indicated that low and environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate possessed estrogenic activity. Glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used for soybean cultivation, and our results also found that there was an additive estrogenic effect between glyphosate and genistein, a phytoestrogen in soybeans. However, these additive effects of glyphosate contamination in soybeans need further animal study.},

These metabolites are beneficial for the plant itself but toxic to other organisms, including human beings. Some of these toxic chemicals are believed to have therapeutic benefits and are therefore used to protect against chronic health complications such as cancer. Inversely, short- and long-term exposure to significant amounts of these phytotoxins may end up with chronic irreversible negative health problems in important organ systems, and in severe cases, they can be carcinogenic and fatal. A systematic literature search of relevant published articles indexed in Google Scholar{\textregistered}, PubMed{\textregistered}, Scopus{\textregistered}, Springer Link{\textregistered}, Web of Science{\textregistered}, MDPI{\textregistered}, and ScienceDirect databases was used to obtain the necessary information. Various traditional and emerging food-processing techniques have been found to considerably reduce most of the toxicants in the food to their safest level. Despite their ability to preserve the nutritional value of processed foods, emerging food processing methods have limited application and accessibility in middle- and low-income countries. As a consequence, much more work is recommended on the implementation of emerging technologies, with additional scientific work on food processing methods that are effective against these naturally occurring plant food toxicants, particularly pyrrolizidine alkaloids.},

For decades, the conventional wisdom has been that the consumption of saturated fat (SFA) undermines cardiovascular health, clogs the arteries, increases risk of CVD, and leads to heart attacks. It is timely to investigate whether this claim holds up to scientific scrutiny. The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss recent scientific evidence on the association between dietary SFA and CVD.                                         Methods and results               PubMed, Google scholar, and Scopus were searched for articles published between 2010 and 2021 on the association between SFA consumption and CVD risk and outcomes. A review was conducted examining observational studies and prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, and long-term RCTs. Collectively, neither observational studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, RCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have conclusively established a significant association between SFA in the diet and subsequent cardiovascular risk and coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or mortality nor a benefit of reducing dietary SFAs on CVD rick, events, and mortality. Beneficial effects of replacement of SFA by polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat or carbohydrates remain elusive.                                         Conclusion               Findings from the studies reviewed in this paper indicate that the consumption of SFA is not significantly associated with CVD risk, events, or mortality. Based on the scientific evidence, there is no scientific ground to demonize SFA as a cause of CVD. SFA naturally occurring in nutrient-dense foods can be safely included in the diet.},

These five nutrients are highly abundant in beef, and have important physiological roles in anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory reactions, as well as neurological, muscular, retinal, immunological and cardiovascular function. Of particular note, taurine, carnosine, anserine, and creatine are absent from plants, and hydroxyproline is negligible in many plant-source foods. Consumption of 30~g dry beef can fully meet daily physiological needs of the healthy 70-kg adult human for taurine and carnosine, and can also provide large amounts of creatine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline to improve human nutrition and health, including metabolic, retinal, immunological,~muscular, cartilage,~neurological, and cardiovascular health. The present review provides the public with the much-needed knowledge of nutritionally and physiologically significant amino acids, dipeptides and creatine in animal-source foods (including beef). Dietary taurine, creatine, carnosine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline are beneficial for preventing and treating obesity, cardiovascular dysfunction, and ageing-related disorders, as well as inhibiting tumorigenesis, improving skin and bone health, ameliorating neurological abnormalities, and promoting well being in infants, children and adults. Furthermore, these nutrients may promote the immunological defense of humans against infections by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (including coronavirus) through enhancing the metabolism and functions of monocytes, macrophages, and other cells of the immune system.

METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946 to October 2011), Cochrane Library (2011), PubMed for articles on dietary fiber intake and constipation using the terms: constipation, fiber, cellulose, plant extracts, cereals, bran, psyllium, or plantago. References of important articles were searched manually for relevant studies. Articles were eligible for the meta-analysis if they were high-quality RCTs and reported data on stool frequency, stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and gastrointestinal symptoms. The data were extracted independently by two researchers (Yang J and Wang HP) according to the described selection criteria. Review manager version 5 software was used for analysis and test. Weighted mean difference with 95\%CI was used for quantitative data, odds ratio (OR) with 95\%CI was used for dichotomous data. Both I(2) statistic with a cut-off of {$\geq$} 50\% and the {$\chi$}(2) test with a P value {$<$} 0.10 were used to define a significant degree of heterogeneity. RESULTS: We searched 1322 potential relevant articles, 19 of which were retrieved for further assessment, 14 studies were excluded for various reasons, five studies were included in the analysis. Dietary fiber showed significant advantage over placebo in stool frequency (OR = 1.19; 95\%CI: 0.58-1.80, P {$<$} 0.05). There was no significant difference in stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and painful defecation between the two groups. Stool frequency were reported by five RCTs, all results showed either a trend or a significant difference in favor of the treatment group, number of stools per week increased in treatment group than in placebo group (OR = 1.19; 95\%CI: 0.58-1.80, P {$<$} 0.05), with no significant heterogeneity among studies (I(2)= 0, P = 0.77). Four studies evaluated stool consistency, one of them presented outcome in terms of percentage of hard stool, which was different from others, so we included the other three studies for analysis. Two studies reported treatment success. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (P {$<$} 0.1, I(2) {$>$} 50\%). Three studies reported laxative use, quantitative data was shown in one study, and the pooled analysis of the other two studies showed no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups in laxative use (OR = 1.07; 95\%CI 0.51-2.25), and no heterogeneity was found (P = 0.84, I(2)= 0). Three studies evaluated painful defecation: one study presented both quantitative and dichotomous data, the other two studies reported quantitative and dichotomous data separately. We used dichotomous data for analysis. CONCLUSION: Dietary fiber intake can obviously increase stool frequency in patients with constipation. It does not obviously improve stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and painful defecation.},

  abstract = {Fe deficiency is a prevalent nutritional disease, and fatigue is a common complaint in the general and patient population. The association between Fe deficiency without anaemia (IDNA) and fatigue is unclear. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Fe on fatigue in patients with IDNA and the association between IDNA and fatigue in the population. Articles from the PubMed database up to 19 January 2016 were systematically searched. A total of six relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT) and six relevant cross-sectional studies were identified. All outcomes were converted into effect sizes. In the meta-analysis of the six RCT, we identified a significant therapeutic effect of Fe in fatigue patients with IDNA (pooled effect size 0{$\cdot$}33; 95 \% CI 0{$\cdot$}17, 0{$\cdot$}48; I 2=0{$\cdot$}0 \%; P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). A sensitivity analysis found that the overall results (i.e. significant association) were robust. In the meta-analysis of the six cross-sectional studies, the association between IDNA and fatigue was not significant (pooled effect size 0{$\cdot$}10; 95 \% CI -0{$\cdot$}11, 0{$\cdot$}31; I 2=57{$\cdot$}4 \%; P=0{$\cdot$}362). A sensitivity analysis found that the overall results (i.e. no significant association) were not robust; removal of one study made the outcomes significant. These meta-analyses suggest that improving Fe status may decrease fatigue. Further research is necessary to identify diagnostic criteria for selecting fatigue patients who might benefit from Fe therapy and to assess the prevalence of IDNA with fatigue in the general population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between a plant-based diet (vegetarianism) and extended life span is increasingly criticised since it may be based on the lack of representative data and insufficient removal of confounders such as lifestyles. AIM: We examined the association between meat intake and life expectancy at a population level based on ecological data published by the United Nations agencies. METHODS: Population-specific data were obtained from 175 countries/territories. Scatter plots, bivariate, partial correlation and linear regression models were used with SPSS 25 to explore and compare the correlations between newborn life expectancy (e(0)), life expectancy at 5 years of life (e(5)) and intakes of meat, and carbohydrate crops, respectively. The established risk factors to life expectancy - caloric intake, urbanization, obesity and education levels - were included as the potential confounders. RESULTS: Worldwide, bivariate correlation analyses revealed that meat intake is positively correlated with life expectancies. This relationship remained significant when influences of caloric intake, urbanization, obesity, education and carbohydrate crops were statistically controlled. Stepwise linear regression selected meat intake, not carbohydrate crops, as one of the significant predictors of life expectancy. In contrast, carbohydrate crops showed weak and negative correlation with life expectancy. CONCLUSION: If meat intake is not incorporated into nutrition science for predicting human life expectancy, results could prove inaccurate.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Animal organ meat (offal) is a food with high nutrient density that is popular in different parts of the world, but its relationship with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is unclear. We aimed to examine whether daily animal organ meat consumption is associated with the presence of NASH in individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS: A total of 136 Chinese adults with biopsy-proven NAFLD were included. Definite NASH was defined as NAFLD activity score {$\geq$}4 and at least one point for steatosis, ballooning, and lobular inflammation. Daily animal organ meat consumption was estimated using a self-administered validated food frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between animal organ meat intake and liver disease severity. RESULTS: The 136 participants (80.9\% men) of the study had a mean {\textpm} standard deviation (SD) age of 39.0{\textpm}12.5 years and body mass index of 27.4{\textpm}3.6 kg/m2. Prevalence of definite NASH was 65.4\%. Daily median organ meat consumption was 1.30 g/1,000 kcal. Animal organ meat consumption was inversely associated with the presence of NASH even after adjustment of demographics, lifestyle variables, metabolic and dietary factors, as well as liver fibrosis stage; adjusted-odds ratios (95\% confidence intervals) for NASH were 0.15 (0.03, 0.69) for the highest tertile and 0.18 (0.05, 0.70) for the medium tertile, compared to the lowest (reference) tertile of animal organ meat intake (P value for trend =0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest for the first time that higher animal organ meat consumption is associated with a lower prevalence of NASH in Chinese individuals with biopsy-proven NAFLD.},
