  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surfer's myelopathy is a rare, acute, atraumatic myelopathy that occurs in novice surfers. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature and to present an illustrative case. METHODS: Medical literature was queried for all reports of this condition, systematically abstracted, and analyzed. An illustrative case that provides the most definitive support for a vascular cause is presented. Treatment considerations based on prior cases and expert opinions are provided. RESULTS: Sixty-four cases of surfer's myelopathy have been reported to date. This atraumatic thoracic/conus medullaris myelopathy with only a 42\% neurological recovery rate almost uniformly affects young, healthy, novice surfers who have no pre-existent spinal disease. Symptoms usually start with back pain and rapidly progress to complete or incomplete myelopathy. T2 magnetic resonance images show increased signal in the central spinal cord within 24 to 72 hours. Gadolinium enhancement and diffusion-weighted imaging are not helpful. Angiography has been underused. Angiogram in our case showed the absence of a right T12 radicular artery and no artery of Adamkiewicz, which, along with clinical findings, support the vascular origin theory. Incomplete cases often improve within 24 hours of onset, whereas no improvement has been reported for American Spinal Injury Association class A cases. Several acute interventions have been tried. Steroids are most common, and patients receiving steroids improved 55\% of the time with no reported adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Surfer's myelopathy is a clinical entity associated with complete deficit in {$>$}50\% of cases. Its prognosis is almost exclusively dictated by severity at presentation/nadir. Thus, publicizing this rare but serious condition (within and outside the medical literature) may be an effective intervention.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a disabling condition with physical, psychological, and financial consequences. The study's goal is to compare the effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (VR) training in balance among individuals with incomplete paraplegia to that of functional electrical stimulation (FES). DESIGN: Two groups, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Neurological Physiotherapy Out Patient Department, Tertiary Care Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen people aged 18-60 years with incomplete SCI. INTERVENTIONS: VR training along with conventional physical therapy (CPT) and FES for Rectus Abdominis and Erector Spinae with CPT five times a week for 4 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were Modified Functional Reach Test (mFRT) and Function in Sitting Test (FIST) to assess sitting balance and Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (SCIM III) for the level of independence. Assessments were taken before initiating treatment and at the end of the 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. Within-group analyses for the mFRT values were performed using Repeated Measures ANOVA test, and between-group analyses were performed using the independent t-test test. Friedman and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used for analyzing FIST and SCIM III. RESULTS: All variables (mFRT and FIST) improved significantly in both groups (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), with the VR\,+\,CPT group showing a more significant result than the FES\,+\,CPT group (P value\,{$<$}\,0.05), except for SCIM III. CONCLUSION: VR as an adjunct to CPT demonstrated proved to be an effective treatment to improve balance among individuals with incomplete paraplegia.Trial registration: Clinical Trials Registry India identifier: CTRI/2020/03/024080.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the autonomic innervation of the cardiovascular system and the cardiovascular sequelae of spinal cord injuries. METHOD: A literature search was carried out in the PubMed database, with the search phrases "traumatic spinal cord injury"/"traumatic spinal cord injuries" together with "autonomic dysfunction", "autonomic dysreflexia" and "cardiovascular disease". RESULTS: The most important cardiovascular complications in the acute phase are bradyarrhythmia, hypotension, enhanced vasovagal reflexes, supraventricular/ventricular ectopic beats, vasodilation and venous stasis. Important in the chronic phase are orthostatic hypotension and impaired regulation of blood pressure, blood volume and body temperature. Tetraplegia is frequently accompanied by autonomic dysreflexia, impaired transmission of cardial pain, loss of muscle mass in the left ventricle and pseudoinfarction. Patients with injuries above the sixth thoracic vertebra have a predisposition for autonomic dysreflexia. This is a condition characterised by sudden, uncontrolled sympathetic response accompanied by a rise in blood pressure. Autonomic dysreflexia usually leads to headaches and erythema on the upper chest. The condition may cause cerebral haemorrhage and is potentially life threatening. Patients with spinal cord injuries have an increased risk of atherosclerotic disease due to overweight, lipid disorders, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. They are predisposed to thrombotic emboli due to venous stasis and hypercoagulopathy, particularly immediately after the injury. INTERPRETATION: Knowledge of cardiovascular sequelae after spinal cord injuries and assessment of these is important for correct diagnostics, planning of preventive measures and optimal treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post spinal cord injury (SCI), sitting balance is considered a prerequisite for the effective performance of activities of daily living. Virtual Reality Training (VRT) may provide an interactive medium of rehabilitation, preventing a reduction in active participation of the patients while allowing for the training of sitting balance. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of VRT to conventional therapy in improving sitting balance in persons with SCI. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a single blinded randomized control trial conducted on 21 subjects with SCI (level of injury: D10 or below). They were randomly allocated into two groups; both groups received their routine exercise program. In addition, the intervention group, that is, Group B (n = 11) received 30 min of VRT in the seated position using Xbox-Kinect, while the conventional therapy group, that is, Group A (n = 10) received 30 min of additional conventional therapy to equalize the duration of the intervention (3 days/week, 4 weeks). The modified functional reach test and T-shirt test were measured at the beginning and at the end of 4 weeks. RESULTS: MFRT changes for forward (Group A: 1.7 {\textpm} 1.09 cm; Group B: 4.83 {\textpm} 2.95 cm), right lateral (Group A: 2.43 {\textpm} 2.81 cm, Group B: 5.08 {\textpm} 1.85 cm), left lateral (Group A: 3.05 {\textpm} 4.65 cm, Group B: 6.19 {\textpm} 1.51 cm) were statistically significant for Group B (P {$<$} 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the two groups for T-shirt test (P {$>$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: VRT can be used as a part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to improve sitting balance post-SCI.},
