  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Resident's case problem. BACKGROUND: Recent literature has suggested that acetabular labral pathology secondary to femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) may be a precursor to early-onset hip osteoarthritis. The purpose of this resident's case problem was to explore the extent to which abnormal movement at the hip is a possible contributor to acetabular labral pathology. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was a 25-year-old female with a 4-year history of anterior-medial groin pain. Based on a combination of the clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging findings, she was given a diagnosis of acetabular labral tear by her orthopaedic surgeon and referred to a physical therapist for assessment. Movement analysis during a single-leg step down, running, and a drop jump maneuver revealed excessive hip adduction and internal rotation on the involved side, which reproduced her symptoms. Application of a hip-strapping device resulted in decreased hip adduction and internal rotation, and an immediate decrease in symptoms. DISCUSSION: The reduction in pain secondary to controlling hip motion suggests that excessive frontal and transverse plane hip motions may contribute to FAI. Accordingly, physical therapy intervention aimed at controlling and reducing hip adduction and internal rotation during activities may be indicated in patients who present with this movement pattern associated with anterior hip/groin pain.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of the tensor fascia latae (TFL) muscle is often clinically implicated in many musculoskeletal disorders. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature of the TFL muscle to determine whether there are differences in its structure and activation between individuals with and without lower limb musculoskeletal conditions. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, and LILACS was undertaken from year of inception to 9 July 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Studies that directly investigated the structure or activity of the TFL muscle between individuals with a lower limb musculoskeletal condition and a pain-free control group. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included (n\,=\,556 participants), eight reporting structure and ten activation of the TFL muscle. Conditions included lateral hip pain, hip joint pathology, ACL injury, iliotibial band syndrome, and patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis. Meta-analysis identified with low confidence (p value\,=\,0.07) a small tendency towards hypertrophy in the affected side of participants with hip joint diseases (SMD 0.37, 95\% CI [- 0.02, 0.77]). Moderate effect sizes were found for a higher cross-sectional area of the TFL/sartorius ratio in abductor tendon tear (SMD 0.74; 95\% CI [0.05, 1.43, p value\,=\,0.04), and for a smaller body mass normalized TFL volume in patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis (SMD - 0.61; 95\% CI [- 1.23, 0.00], p value\,=\,0.05). Normalised electromyography~(EMG) amplitude did not differ between groups for any condition, but when EMG was analysed as linear envelopes or synergies, some differences in pattern of TFL activation were observed between individuals with lateral hip pain and controls. Timing of TFL activation did not differ between individuals with knee conditions and controls. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Common clinical assumptions of the role of TFL muscle in lower limb musculoskeletal conditions are not well investigated and poorly supported by current research. There are contradictory findings on the muscle size of TFL. Differing methodology in muscle activation studies precludes a clear interpretation for comparison between groups.

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Single-subject research design using 4 consecutive patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether treatment using soft tissue therapy (ART or Active Release Technique), stretching, and strengthening of the hip abductors, hip external rotators, and tensor fascia latae muscles reduces pain and improves self-reported hip function in patients with acetabular labral tears who also have posterolateral hip pain of suspected myofascial origin. BACKGROUND: Acetabular labral tears cause pain in some but not all patients. Pain commonly presents anteriorly but may also present posteriorly and laterally. The standard of care is arthroscopic repair, which helps many but not all patients. It is possible that these patients may present with extra-articular contributions to their pain, such as myofascial pain, making their clinical presentation more complex. No previous study has assessed soft tissue therapy as a treatment option for this subset of patients. METHODS: This A-B-A design used repeated measures of the Hip Outcome Score and visual analog scale for pain. Four patients were treated for 6 to 8 weeks, using a combination of soft tissue therapy, stretching, and strengthening for the hip abductors, external rotators, and tensor fascia latae. Data were assessed visually, statistically, and by comparing mean differences before and after intervention. RESULTS: All 4 patients experienced both statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in posterolateral hip pain and hip-related function. Three patients also experienced reduction in anteromedial hip pain. CONCLUSION: Myofascial hip pain may contribute to hip-related symptoms and disability in patients with acetabular labral tears and posterolateral hip pain. These patients may benefit from soft tissue therapy combined with stretching and strengthening exercises targeting the hip abductors, tensor fascia latae, and hip external rotator muscles.

Some tears may require surgical intervention, especially if they are associated with boney pathology such as femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). A protocol for nonoperative treatment of the hip labral tears is not well established. OBJECTIVE: To identify current nonoperative treatment options, comorbidities, sports participation, and outcomes of adolescent athletes who were diagnosed with hip labral tears. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A regional tertiary level medical and academic institution. PARTICIPANTS: Physically active 8- to 20-year-old males and females who were diagnosed with hip labral tears in 2010 to 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nonoperative treatment interventions including physical therapy (PT), intraarticular injection (IAI), the type of sports participation, and comorbidity were extracted. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics and {$\chi$} tests were used with a priori alpha level {$<$}0.05. RESULTS: Among 76 adolescent athletes who were diagnosed with hip labral tear, 52 (68.4\%) had PT, 55 (72.4\%) received IAI, and 43 (56.6\%) experienced both PT and IAI interventions. Top 3 sports participated were dance (18.4\%), soccer (14.5\%), and gymnastics (7.9\%). The most common comorbidity was FAI, which was observed in 46 individuals (60.5\%). Although there was no difference in a proportion of FAI cases between sexes, a greater proportion of surgical cases were observed among hip labrum-injured athletes with FAI compared with those without FAI (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent athletes with hip labral tears often receive PT, IAI, and a combination of both, as nonoperative treatment options in this study cohort. The adolescent athletes who sustained hip labral tears with comorbidity of FAI had significantly greater proportion of surgical cases after nonoperative treatments.},

An understanding of specific muscles affected will help guide targeted rehabilitation. Objectives of this case-control study were to compare gluteal and tensor fasciae latae (TFL) muscle size and quality (fatty infiltration) in women with symptomatic GTPS to asymptomatic age-matched female controls. Magnetic resonance imaging of 16 women with GTPS (mean age 55.75\,years, range 23-69) and 15 asymptomatic controls (mean age 55.60\,years, range 31-66) was undertaken. Muscle volumes of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and TFL were calculated. Fatty infiltration was rated using the Goutallier classification system for all muscles in their entirety, as well as anterior and posterior segments of gluteus medius and minimus. Muscle volumes and fatty infiltration were compared between groups. Significantly smaller muscle volumes were identified in the symptomatic group for the upper (P =\,0.01) and lower (P =\,0.04) portions of gluteus maximus, gluteus medius (P =\,0.03), and gluteus minimus (P =\,0.02). There was no difference in TFL (P =\,0.18). Symptomatic participants displayed significantly greater fatty infiltration in gluteus maximus upper (P =\,0.021) and lower (P =\,0.049) when adjusted for BMI, and gluteus minimus (P =\,0.018), particularly in the posterior portion (P =\,0.04). Anterior gluteus minimus demonstrated high amounts of fatty infiltration in both groups. Gluteal muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration in women with GTPS suggests gluteus maximus and minimus may be an important target for rehabilitation. Clin.

  abstract = {Microinstability is an increasingly recognized diagnosis in young athletes presenting with hip pain. Causes of microinstability may include abnormality of the hip bony anatomy, acetabular labral tears, joint capsule laxity or injury, and muscle dysfunction. Borderline hip dysplasia is an increasingly recognized factor predisposing to microinstability. The capsuloligamentous structures of the hip, particularly the iliofemoral ligament, provide important restraints to femoral head motion, and iatrogenic defects can predispose patients to instability after surgery. Injury to the acetabular labrum may disrupt its important hip-stabilizing properties including the suction seal and improved acetabular depth. Hip muscle weakness or imbalance may result in increased femoral head motion within the acetabulum. The diagnosis of hip microinstability can be challenging, and the history is often nonspecific. Physical examination maneuvers include the anterior apprehension, prone instability, axial distraction, and abduction-hyperextension-external rotation tests. Radiographic features may include borderline hip dysplasia, femoral head-neck junction cliff sign, and an elevated femoral-epiphyseal acetabular roof index. Magnetic resonance arthrography may demonstrate a capsular defect, capsular thinning, or labral pathology. Diagnostic intra-articular injection of anesthetic can confirm the intra-articular nature of the pathology. Management of hip microinstability focuses on strengthening the dynamic stabilizers of the hip through focused physical therapy. Surgery may be considered in recalcitrant cases where symptoms persist despite optimization of hip stabilizer strength. In such cases, addressing the primary source of instability through labral repair or reconstruction and capsular repair or plication can be considered. In highly selected cases, surgery can result in excellent outcomes.},

  abstract = {The hip labrum has many functions, including shock absorption, joint lubrication, pressure distribution, and aiding in stability, with damage to the labrum associated with osteoarthritis. The etiology of labral tears includes trauma, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), capsular laxity/hip hypermobility, dysplasia, and degeneration. Labral tears present with anterior hip or groin pain, and less commonly buttock pain. Frequently, there are also mechanical symptoms including clicking, locking, and giving way. The most consistent physical examination finding is a positive anterior hip impingement test. Because of the vast differential diagnosis and the need for specialized diagnostic tools, labral tears frequently go undiagnosed during an extended period of time. Evaluation usually begins with plain radiographs to assess for dysplasia, degeneration, and other causes of pain. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography scans are unreliable for diagnosis, magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) is the diagnostic test of choice, with arthroscopy being the gold standard. Typically, treatment begins conservatively with relative rest and non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents, with physical therapy (PT) being controversial. Often, surgical treatment is necessary, which entails, arthroscopic debridement of labral tears and surgical repair of associated structural problems.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gluteal insufficiency is a common and challenging complaint. New concepts in pathobiomechanics and improved clinical understanding of chronic gluteal dysfunction have unmasked gluteus medius (GMed) tears as an underlying cause of enhanced trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). These tears are often missed or misdiagnosed as bursitis, but lead to prolonged chronic peritrochanteric pain. Clinic: The clinical signs are often dull pain on the lateral hip aspect, reduced hip abduction strength with positive Trendelenburg testing and a tendency for the leg to external rotation, as the internal rotation strength is reduced. IMAGING: Radiography and ultrasound may be used to confirm the diagnosis, whereas MRI is the modality of choice for imaging. Compensatory hypertrophy of the tensor fascia latae muscle (TFL) and fatty involution (especially of the GMed) are also seen. THERAPY: Conservative treatment regimens for partial thickness tears involve hip joint centering and strengthening of abductor muscles, sparing TFL. Failed conservative treatment and full thickness tears are treated surgically. Partial tears can be addressed endoscopically with suture anchors for tendon footprint reconstruction. Larger tears involving the anterior and/or lateral facets of the tendon or failed conservative treatment are repaired with minimally invasive open reduction techniques. Double row suture anchor techniques provide anatomical tendon footprint reconstruction. Postoperative rehabilitation is prolonged, due to high acting forces in the peritrochanteric region, and needs to be carried out under professional surveillance. CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of gluteal tendon tears is often the only solution in the treatment of chronic hip pain due to gluteal insufficiency. Available data suggest that reduction in pain and restoration of abduction power can be achieved in mid-term follow-up.},

This injury may be seen in both adolescent and skeletally mature athletes and shares several characteristics with the "Superior Labral tear from Anterior to Posterior (SLAP)" lesion in the shoulder. METHODS: We present a case example, as well as a detailed anatomic description of the pathological condition. RESULTS: As the rectus femoris crosses two joints it is exposed to substantial forces during muscle contraction. Considering the peri-articular origin of the reflected head at the superior aspect of the acetabular rim, a powerful eccentric contraction of the rectus femoris muscle or traction related to sudden knee flexion may cause an avulsion injury of the rectus femoris as well as a concomitant labral tear. CONCLUSIONS: A strain injury of the rectus femoris muscle, which is common in young athletic patients, may cause a concomitant tear of the acetabular labrum. Therefore, we recommend further diagnostic work-up in cases with prolonged hip pain and impaired hip function following an AIIS injury in order to identify any associated peri- and intra-articular damage. In our experience these patients seldom need aggressive surgical management.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is a common overuse injury in runners with parallels to our findings of overuse in Greco Roman wrestlers. Despite research indicating coordination and movement-based factors about the hip, no studies were found using functional motor control (FMC) in runners or wrestlers with ITBS. Thus, we compared FMC exercises and therapeutic exercises (TEs) on pain, function, muscle strength, and range of motion (ROM) in national-level Greco Roman wrestlers with ITBS. DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Sixty national-level Greco Roman wrestlers diagnosed with ITBS were randomly assigned to 8~weeks of FMC exercises, TE, and a control group (20 individuals for each group). Pain (visual analog scale), function (triple hop test for distance, single-leg vertical jump test, and agility T test), muscle strength (handheld dynamometer), and ROM (goniometer) were measured at baseline and 8~weeks after intervention as posttest. RESULTS: Although both interventions significantly reduced pain (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .87), improved function (triple hop test P = .004, {$\eta$}2 = .94; single-leg vertical jump P = .002, {$\eta$}2 = .93; and T test P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .93) and strength (hip abduction (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .52), hip external rotation (P = .02, {$\eta$}2 = .95), knee flexion (P {$\leq$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .94), and knee extension (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .91) compared with the control group, FMC showed more significant improvements in comparison with TE. Significant differences (P = .001) were observed between FMC and TE compared with the control group in ROM outcome. However, TE was more effective than FMC in improving ROM hip abduction (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .93), hip adduction (P = .000, {$\eta$}2 = .92), hip internal rotation (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .92), and hip external rotation (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .93). CONCLUSION: FMC exercises were superior to TE in terms of pain, function, and muscle strength, whereas TE was more effective for improving ROM. FMC exercise is suggested as an effective intervention for improvement of the outcomes related to ITBS in national-level Greco Roman wrestlers.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients who underwent physiotherapy for treatment of symptomatic acetabular labral tears were enrolled. We evaluated the severity of the acetabular labral tears, which were classified based on the Czerny classification system using 3-T MRI. Clinical findings of microinstability and extra-articular pathologies of the hip joint were also examined. The International Hip Outcome Tool 12 (iHOT12) was use for evaluation of outcome scores pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: The mean iHOT12 score showed significant improvement from 44.0 to 73.6 in 4.7 months. Compared with pre-intervention scores, significantly higher post-intervention iHOT12 scores were observed for Czerny stages I and II tears (all P{$<$}0.01). However, no significant difference was observed between pre-intervention and post-intervention iHOT12 scores for stage III tears (P=0.061). In addition, seven patients (20.0\%) had positive microinstability findings and 22 patients (62.9\%) had findings of extra-articular pathologies. Of the 35 patients, eight patients (22.9\%) underwent surgical treatment after failure of conservative management; four of these patients had Czerny stage III tears. CONCLUSION: The iHOT12 score of patients with acetabular labral tears was significantly improved by physiotherapy in the short-term period. Improvement of the clinical score by physiotherapy may be poor in patients with severe acetabular labral tears. Determining the severity of acetabular labral tears can be useful in determining treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Anterior hip or groin pain is a common complaint for which people are referred for physical therapy, with the hip region being involved in approximately 5\% to 9\% of injuries in high school athletes.1 Although anterior hip pain is known to result from a number of musculoskeletal and systemic pathologies, a tear of the acetabular labrum is a recent addition to the list that is of particular interest to physical therapists. This mechanically induced pathology is thought to result from excessive forces at the hip joint2,3 and has been proposed as part of a continuum of hip joint disease that may result in articular cartilage degeneration.2 Although the number of recent articles in the orthopedic literature identifying acetabular labral tears as a source of hip pain is increasing, labral tears often evade detection, resulting in a long duration of symptoms, greater than 2 years on average, before diagnosis.4--8 Studies have shown that 22\% of athletes with groin pain9 and 55\% of patients with mechanical hip pain of unknown etiology2 were found to have a labral tear upon further evaluation. In order to provide the most appropriate intervention for patients with anterior hip or groin pain, physical therapists should be knowledgeable about all of the possible sources and causes of this pain, including a tear of the acetabular labrum and the possible factors contributing to these tears. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review the anatomy and function of the acetabular labrum and present current concepts on the etiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of labral tears.},

Once considered an uncommon entity, labral tears have recently received wider recognition as a source of symptoms and functional limitation. Information regarding acetabular labral tears and their association to capsular laxity, femoral acetabular impingement (FAI), dysplasia of the acetabulum, and chondral lesions is emerging. Physical therapists should understand the anatomical structures of the hip and recognize how the clinical presentation of labral tears is difficult to view isolated from other hip articular pathologies. Clinical examination should consider lumbopelvic and extra-articular pathologies in addition to intra-articular pathologies when assessing for the source of symptoms and functional limitation. If a labral tear is suspected, further diagnostic testing may be indicated. Although up-and-coming evidence suggests that information obtained from patient history and clinical examination can be useful, continued research is warranted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of our examination techniques.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The indications for hip arthroscopy in patients aged {$\geq$}40 years remain controversial, as observational studies have suggested that advanced age portends poor functional outcomes, poor durability of improvement, and high rates of conversion to total hip arthroplasty. PURPOSE: To compare hip arthroscopy versus nonoperative management for symptomatic labral tears in patients aged {$\geq$}40 years with limited radiographic osteoarthritis. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: This single-surgeon, parallel randomized controlled trial included patients aged {$\geq$}40 years with limited osteoarthritis (T{\"o}nnis grades 0-2) who were randomized 1:1 to arthroscopic surgery with postoperative physical therapy (SPT) or physical therapy alone (PTA). Patients who received PTA and achieved unsatisfactory improvement were permitted to cross over to SPT after completing {$\geq$}14 weeks of physical therapy (CO). The primary outcomes were the International Hip Outcome Tool-33 score and modified Harris Hip Score at 24 months after surgery, and secondary outcomes included other patient-reported outcome measures and the visual analog scale for pain. The primary analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis using linear mixed-effects models. Sensitivity analyses included modified as-treated and treatment-failure analyses. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients were included, with 52 (53.6\%) patients in the SPT group and 45 (46.4\%) patients in the PTA group. Of the patients who underwent PTA, 32 (71.1\%) patients crossed over to arthroscopy at a mean of 5.10 months (SD, 3.3 months) after physical therapy initiation. In both intention-to-treat and modified as-treated analyses, the SPT group displayed superior mean patient-reported outcome measure and pain scores across the study period for nearly all metrics relative to the PTA group. In the treatment-failure analysis, the SPT and CO groups showed greater improvement across all metrics compared with PTA; however, post hoc analyses revealed no significant differences in improvement between the SPT and CO groups. No significant differences were observed between groups in rates of total hip arthroplasty conversion. CONCLUSION: In patients {$\geq$}40 years of age with limited osteoarthritis, hip arthroscopy with postoperative physical therapy led to better outcomes than PTA at a 24-month follow-up. However, additional preoperative physical therapy did not compromise surgical outcomes and allowed some patients to avoid surgery. When surgery is indicated, age {$\geq$}40 years should not be considered an independent contraindication to arthroscopic acetabular labral repair.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought to determine whether continuous passive motion (CPM) usage improves outcomes following arthroscopic hip surgery involving acetabular labral repair. Our hypothesis is that CPM usage reduces pain and pain medication use and improves quality of life in individuals who undergo hip arthroscopy. METHODS: We created a randomized controlled trial consisting of 54 patients who underwent arthroscopic acetabular labral repair. Patients were randomized to two groups, one with CPM use post-operatively and one without. Primary outcomes measured were pain level, patient satisfaction, and quality of life. Parameters used to measure these outcomes were self-reported pain scores on Likert scale, frequency of analgesic medication use, and self-reported scores on Hip Outcome Score Activity of Daily Living (HOS ADL). These parameters were compared between the two randomized groups using t-test for statistical analysis. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the treatment and control groups in terms of patient characteristics. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of HOS ADL scores, although the patients in the control group demonstrated a trend toward higher HOS ADL scores. The patients in the CPM group had a statistically significant decrease in pain levels after surgery compared to patients in the control group. The total morphine equivalent dose consumed in the first two post-operative weeks was higher in the control group compared to the CPM group, although this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Use of CPM resulted in lower pain level scores in patients after hip arthroscopy. Although there is no statistical difference in quality of life or quantity of analgesics consumed post-operatively, patients who used CPM tended to have lower HOS ADL scores (which is desirable) and less consumption of pain medication. A study with a larger sample of patients might elucidate more differences between the two groups. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II, therapeutic.},

Thirty-seven hips with an MRI confirmed labral tear were prospectively enrolled in a graduated management protocol created for adolescents. The protocol began with activity modification and focused physical therapy. Patients with persistent symptoms were offered an intraarticular corticosteroid injection. Those with continued symptoms were treated with arthroscopic surgery. The modified Harris hip score (mHHS) and nonarthritic hip score (NAHS) were recorded at the initial visit.

At presentation, the mean mHHS and NAHS for the entire cohort was 66.4\,\,{\textpm}\,\,11.4 and 70.2\,\,{\textpm}\,\,12.6, and these values improved significantly to 89.3\,\,{\textpm}\,\,10.6 and 87.0\,\,{\textpm}\,\,11.4 at a mean follow-up of 35.7\,\,{\textpm}\,\,18.3\,months (range 11.7-64.4\,months). Forty-two percent of hips were managed with physical therapy and activity modifications alone, 28\% of hips progressed to a steroid injection but did not require surgery, and 31\% required arthroscopic intervention. Seventy-three percent of hips treated with activity modification alone, 80\% treated with an injection, and 82\% of hips treated with arthroscopic repair met the minimal clinically significant difference (MCID) (P\,=\,0.859).

HYPOTHESIS: It was hypothesized that introducing conservative physical therapy (PT) preoperatively along with a slow progression to return to activity using a structured, patient-guided postoperative program would improve patient outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of patients who received a hip arthroscopy, were at least 18 years old, and who had completed the following patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at 1-year follow-up: modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Hip Outcome Score, Nonarthritic Hip Score, International Hip Outcome Tool-33, and Lower Extremity Functional Scale. Patients who underwent previous surgery on the ipsilateral hip and those with cartilage erosion down to exposed subchondral bone (Outerbridge grade 4) were excluded. Paired-samples t tests were used to compare the change in PRO scores at 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year follow-up, and the percentage of patients who achieved minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and substantial clinical benefit (SCB) thresholds on the mHHS were stratified according to their Outerbridge grade (0-3). RESULTS: Overall, 202 patients (53\% female, 47\% male) were included in the analysis. Significant improvement was seen from 3 to 6 months on all PRO measures and from 6 months to 1 year on all but the mHHS (P {$<$} .05 for all except the mHHS). A significantly smaller percentage of patients with Outerbridge grade 3 cartilage damage achieved the MCID and SCB on the mHHS compared with those with grade 0, both at 6 months (grade 3 vs 0: 20\% vs 63.2\% [MCID]; 18.0\% vs 52.6\% [SCB]; both P = .03) and 1 year (grade 3 vs 0: 22.0\% vs 57.9\% [MCID]; 14.0\% vs 52.6\% [SCB]; both P {$<$} .05).

STUDY DESIGN: Case Series. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Six subjects (20 - 65 years old) with confirmed FAIS and/or ALTs were included. Subjects were assigned to different treatment pathways based on their individual presentation. Three subjects were categorized as having primary mobility impairments and three were categorized with primary neuromuscular control impairments. Treatment intensity was adjusted according to the individual nature of symptoms, and on average lasted 81 days. OUTCOMES: Clinically important improvements were seen on all self-reported outcome measures (International Hip Outcome Tool - 33, Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Patient Specific Functional Scale, and Global Rating of Change). At two years, none of the subjects had elected surgical management. DISCUSSION: These cases illustrate the clinical reasoning process utilized to prioritize subjects' treatment along a continuum of neuromuscular control and mobility. The treatment approach also illustrates successful management of potential surgical candidates that elected to forego surgery after satisfactory completion of conservative management.

The purpose of this case report is to describe a clinical pathway for conservative management of a patient with an acute acetabular labral tear and femoroacetabular impingement. Case Description The patient was an 18-year-old woman with recent onset of right groin pain who underwent intra-articular corticosteroid injection and therapeutic exercise for the management of an acute acetabular labral tear identified on radiographic imaging. Prior to physical therapy, the patient received an intra-articular hip injection for diagnostic purposes and pain relief. Upon initial evaluation, the patient presented with improved pain but with continued kinesthetic deficits, inflexibility, muscle imbalances, and reproduction of symptoms with end-range hip motions. A physical therapy plan was implemented using neuromuscular re-education to address her continued impairments. Outcomes Marked improvements were noted at discharge and 6-month follow-up for pain, strength, and function as demonstrated on the Patient-Specific Functional Scale, global rating of change scale, and International Hip Outcome Tool-33.

Useful clinical utility of these measures is necessary to support diagnostic imaging and subsequent surgical decision-making. OBJECTIVE: Summarise/evaluate the current diagnostic accuracy of various clinical tests germane to hip FAI/ALT pathology. METHODS: A computer-assisted literature search of MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE databases using keywords related to diagnostic accuracy of the hip joint, as well as the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the search and reporting phases of the study. Quality assessment of bias and applicability was conducted using the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Random effects models were used to summarise sensitivities (SN), specificities (SP), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and respective confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The employed search strategy revealed 21 potential articles, with one demonstrating high quality. Nine articles qualified for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated that flexion-adduction-internal rotation (pooled SN ranging from 0.94 (95\% CI 0.90 to 0.97) to 0.99 (95\% CI 0.98 to 1.00); DOR 5.71 (95\% CI 0.84 to 38.86) to 7.82 (95\% CI 1.06 to 57.84)) and flexion-internal rotation (pooled SN 0.96 (95\% CI 0.81 to 0.99); DOR 8.36 (95\% CI 0.41 to 171.3) tests possess only screening accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Few hip physical examination tests for diagnosing FAI/ALT have been investigated in enough studies of substantial quality to direct clinical decision-making. Further high-quality studies across a wider spectrum of hip pathology patients are recommended to discern the confirmed clinical utility of these tests.

  abstract = {Study Design Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial and a prospective cohort. Background The number of arthroscopic surgical procedures for patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) has significantly increased worldwide, but high-quality evidence of the effect of such interventions is lacking. Objectives The primary objective will be to determine the efficacy of hip arthroscopic procedures compared to sham surgery on patient-reported outcomes for patients with FAIS (HIP ARThroscopy International [HIPARTI] Study). The secondary objective will be to evaluate prognostic factors for long-term outcome after arthroscopic surgical interventions in patients with FAIS (Hip ARthroscopy Prospective [HARP] Study). Methods The HIPARTI Study will include 140 patients and the HARP Study will include 100 patients. The international Hip Outcome Tool-33 will be the primary outcome measure at 1 year. Secondary outcome measures will be the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale, fear of movement (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia), Patient-Specific Functional Scale, global rating of change score, and expectations. Other outcomes will include active hip range of motion, hip muscle strength tests, functional performance tests, as well as radiological assessments using radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusion To determine the true effect of surgery, beyond that of placebo, double-blinded placebo-controlled trials including sham surgery are needed. The HIPARTI Study will direct future evidence-based treatment of FAIS. Predictors for long-term development and progression of degenerative changes in the hip are also needed for this young patient group with FAIS; hence, responders and nonresponders to treatment could be determined.

  abstract = {Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a motion-related pathology of the hip characterized by pain, morphological abnormalities of the proximal femur, and an elevated risk of joint deterioration and hip osteoarthritis. Activities that require deep flexion are understood to induce impingement in cam FAIS patients, however, less demanding activities such as walking and pivoting may induce pain as well as alterations in kinematics and joint stability. Still, the paucity of quantitative descriptions of cam FAIS has hindered understanding underlying hip joint mechanics during such activities. Previous in silico studies have employed generalized model geometry or kinematics to simulate impingement between the femur and acetabulum, which may not accurately capture the interplay between morphology and motion. In this study, we utilized models with participant-specific bone and articular soft tissue anatomy and kinematics measured by dual-fluoroscopy to compare hip contact mechanics of cam FAIS patients to controls during four activities of daily living (internal/external pivoting and level/incline walking). Averaged across the gait cycle during incline walking, patients displayed increased strain in the anterior joint (labrum strain: p-value~=~0.038, patients: 11.7~{\textpm}~6.7~\%, controls: 5.0~{\textpm}~3.6~\%; cartilage strain: p-value~=~0.029, patients: 9.1~{\textpm}~3.3~\%, controls: 4.2~{\textpm}~2.3). Patients also exhibited increased average anterior cartilage strains during external pivoting (p-value~=~0.039; patients: 13.0~{\textpm}~9.2~\%, controls: 3.9~{\textpm}~3.2~\%]). No significant differences between patient and control contact area and strain were found for level walking and internal pivoting. Our study provides new insights into the biomechanics of cam FAIS, including spatiotemporal hip joint contact mechanics during activities of daily living.},
