  abstract = {CONTEXT: Current perception dictates that glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) is a chronic adaptation that leads to an increased risk of pathologic conditions in the dominant shoulder or elbow of overhead athletes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adaptations in glenohumeral range of motion in overhead athletes lead to injuries of the upper extremity, specifically in the shoulder or elbow. DATA SOURCES: An electronic database search was performed using Medline, Embase, and SportDiscus from 1950 to 2016. The following keywords were used: GIRD, glenohumeral internal rotation deficit, glenohumeral deficit, shoulder, sport, injury, shoulder joint, baseball, football, racquet sports, volleyball, javelin, cricket, athletic injuries, handball, lacrosse, water polo, hammer throw, and throwing injury. STUDY SELECTION: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Of those 17 studies, 10 included specific range of motion measurements required for inclusion in the meta-analysis. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on demographics and methodology as well as shoulder range of motion in various planes were collected when possible. The primary outcome of interest was upper extremity injury, specifically shoulder or elbow injury. RESULTS: The systematic review included 2195 athletes (1889 males, 306 females) with a mean age of 20.8 years. Shoulders with GIRD favored an upper extremity injury, with a mean difference of 3.11{$^\circ$} (95\% CI, -0.13{$^\circ$} to 6.36{$^\circ$}; P = 0.06). Shoulder total range of motion suggested increased motion (mean difference, 2.97{$^\circ$}) correlated with no injury ( P = 0.11), and less total motion (mean difference, 1.95{$^\circ$}) favored injury ( P = 0.14). External rotational gain also favored injury, with a mean difference of 1.93{$^\circ$} ( P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: The pooled results of this systematic review and meta-analysis did not reach statistical significance for any shoulder motion measurement and its correlation to shoulder or elbow injury. Results, though not reaching significance, favored injury in overhead athletes with GIRD, as well as rotational loss and external rotational gain.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The shoulder manual resistance test is one of the common clinical assessments for patients with muscle weakness. However, there have been no studies investigating the threshold for muscle weakness. The purpose of this study was to clarify the threshold for muscle weakness in the shoulder manual muscle resistance test. METHODS: Fifty-three patients (37.9~{\textpm}~20.6~years old) with either rotator cuff tear (21 patients), superior labrum anterior-to-posterior (SLAP) lesion (7 patients), or Bankart lesion (25 patients) of one shoulder were administered three manual muscle resistance tests (abduction strength, external rotation, and belly press tests). Positive results in these tests were defined as a subjective weakness in the involved shoulder compared to the opposite shoulder. Based on this result, the patients were divided into positive and negative groups. Another observer measured isometric strength using a hand-held dynamometer and calculated the side-to-side ratio. Comparing instrument measurement with manual measurement, the cut-off point, at which we can recognise that there is a side-to-side difference, was calculated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: The cases with less than 60\% of the muscle strength in the contralateral shoulder were judged as positive in all examinations, whereas among the cases with 60-90\% of muscle strength, there was a mixture of negative and positive determinations. The cut-off point was 78.9\% in the abduction strength test, 73.8\% in the external rotation test, and 84.0\% in the belly press test. CONCLUSION: The side-to-side difference could be manually detected, when muscle strength was less than 75-85\% of that on the contralateral side. This finding suggests that it is necessary to understand the limitation of these manual tests in the case of clinical examinations. Therefore, care must be taken for the shoulder manual muscle resistance test as muscle weakness cannot be fully detected by manual measurement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case-control study, Level IV.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Shoulder instability is extremely common, with various outcome scores used to assess its progression after treatment. This review was performed to identify the scores most commonly used and to evaluate them according to the 4 core domains of shoulder trials (according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [COMET] initiative) and their respective psychometric qualities. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature of 3 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed) was undertaken. Studies were identified using eligibility criteria and critically appraised by 2 authors. Data were extracted using an a priori template. Outcome scores were identified and assessed regarding COMET domain inclusion and their psychometric properties. RESULTS: The most frequently used scores were the Rowe (58\%), Constant (33\%), Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI; 24\%), and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (23\%) scores. The majority of outcome scores assessed pain and all assessed physical functioning. Quality of life and a global assessment of treatment success were rarely incorporated. No single outcome score considered all core COMET domains. The WOSI was the most acceptable measure of those assessed with respect to its validity, reliability, and responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The WOSI incorporated 3 of the 4 core domains for shoulder trials (pain, physical functioning, and health-related quality of life). It had the most psychometric testing of the identified scores, confirming its reliability, validity, and responsiveness in the setting of shoulder instability. We recommend its use in this setting; however, it should be supplemented with additional outcome scores, such as the University of California-Los Angeles score, to cover all of the core COMET domains.},
