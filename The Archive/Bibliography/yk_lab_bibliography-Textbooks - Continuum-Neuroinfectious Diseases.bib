  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Both broadly immunosuppressive medications and selective immunomodulatory agents that act on particular components of the immune system are increasingly used in the treatment of neurologic and non-neurologic diseases. These therapies predispose patients to particular infections, some of which may affect the nervous system. Therefore, familiarity with the clinical and radiologic features of neurologic infections associated with specific immunomodulatory therapies is of importance for the practicing neurologist. This article reviews these neuroinfectious conditions, as well as other neurologic complications unique to transplant recipients and other patients who are immunocompromised.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Diagnosis of infectious pathogens in patients who are immunocompromised may be particularly challenging because a decreased immune response can lead to atypical imaging or laboratory findings. Next-generation sequencing and other novel diagnostic modalities may improve the rate of early identification of neurologic infections in patients who are immunocompromised and ultimately ameliorate outcomes in this vulnerable population.                                         SUMMARY               A broad range of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections of the nervous system can complicate solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplantation as well as other forms of immunocompromise. In addition to neurologic infections, such patients are at risk of neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory complications related to immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapies. Early recognition of infectious and noninfectious complications of immunocompromise is essential to guide appropriate treatment, which can include antimicrobial therapy and, in some cases, withdrawal of the predisposing medication with a transition to an alternative regimen.},

RECENT FINDINGS               As more patients are becoming therapeutically immunosuppressed, human herpesvirus infections are increasingly common. Historically, infections with human herpesviruses were described as temporal lobe encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 or type 2. More recently, however, additional pathogens, such as varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6 have been identified to cause serious neurologic infections. As literature emerges, clinical presentations of herpesvirus infections have taken on many new forms, becoming heterogeneous and involving nearly every location along the neuraxis. Advanced diagnostic methods are now available for each specific pathogen in the herpesvirus family. As data emerge on viral resistance to conventional therapies, newer antiviral medications must be considered.                                         SUMMARY               Infections from the herpesvirus family can have devastating neurologic outcomes without prompt and appropriate treatment. Clinical recognition of symptoms and appropriate advanced testing are necessary to correctly identify the infectious etiology. Knowledge of secondary neurologic complications of disease is equally important to prevent additional morbidity and mortality. This article discusses infections of the central and peripheral nervous systems caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6. The pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentations of disease, diagnostic investigations, imaging characteristics, and treatment for each infectious etiology are discussed in detail.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The increased use of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapy to treat autoimmune diseases has led to an increase in opportunistic neurologic infections. The description of numerous causes of autoimmune antibody--mediated encephalitis over the past decade has expanded the differential diagnosis of encephalitis beyond infection. The emergence of metagenomic next-generation sequencing has led to diagnoses of rare or unexpected causes of neurologic infections and has the potential to enhance diagnostic precision in neuroinfectious diseases.                                         SUMMARY               Infections of the nervous system can affect any level of the neuraxis and present over any time course. Neurologic infections may present atypically with respect to clinical, radiologic, and CSF analysis features in immunocompromised patients or older adults. A thorough evaluation including systemic features, past medical history, travel, exposures, detailed examination, neuroimaging, and CSF analysis is often necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. It is important to be aware of the test characteristics and limitations of microbiological tests on CSF for neurologic infections to avoid being misled by false positives or false negatives.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Tetanus is most common in lower-income settings, but rare cases are seen in higher-income settings because of the inadequate maintenance of vaccination status. Foodborne botulism remains rare, but botulism can also be caused by IV drug use (wound botulism) and medical use of botulinum toxin (iatrogenic botulism); botulinum toxin has also been considered a potential agent of bioterrorism. Diphtheric neuropathy is rare but has been seen in recent epidemics in the former Soviet Union, and vaccination status is inadequate in a significant proportion of older individuals, creating the potential for subsequent epidemics.                                         SUMMARY               Tetanus, botulism, and diphtheric neuropathy are rare in higher-resource settings where most neurologists practice; however, familiarity with the unique clinical manifestations of and laboratory evaluation for these disorders is essential for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of patients with these conditions.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Aging of the population, increasing use of immunosuppressive medications, and other factors have contributed to increasing rates of spinal infections. Although the most common agents responsible for spinal infections remain bacteria and viruses, fungal infections occur in individuals who are immunocompromised, and parasitic infections are common in endemic regions, but patterns are in evolution with migration and climate change. Recent outbreaks of acute flaccid myelitis in children have been associated with enteroviruses A71 and D68.                                         SUMMARY               Infections of the spine and spinal cord can be challenging to diagnose, requiring a thorough history and neurologic examination, laboratory studies of serum and CSF, neuroimaging (particularly MRI), and, in some instances, biopsy, to establish a diagnosis and treatment regimen.

RECENT FINDINGS               Emigration from and travel to areas endemic for helminthic infections that affect the nervous system has led to increased incidence of parasitic neurologic disease in developed countries, necessitating that neurologists be familiar with the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to these diseases.

SUMMARY               Parenchymal neurocysticercosis is a leading cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide, and extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis is responsible for many cases of hydrocephalus. Recognition of the different stages and locations of neurocysticercosis is essential for proper management.

This article outlines the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of brain abscesses and spinal epidural abscesses, with a specific focus on bacterial infections.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The overall incidence of brain abscesses has declined, in part because of fewer brain abscesses associated with otogenic infections. However, emerging patient populations at high risk for brain abscess include those with a history of penetrating head trauma, neurosurgery, or immunodeficiency. Improved mortality rates for brain abscess are attributable to modern diagnostic imaging, stereotactic-guided aspiration, and newer antimicrobials that readily penetrate into the central nervous system and abscesses. Brain MRI is more sensitive than CT for brain abscess, particularly in the early stages, but CT remains more widely available and can adequately identify potential abscesses and confirm response to treatment. With the advent of minimally invasive neurosurgical techniques, surgical excision is often employed only for posterior fossa, multiloculated, or superficial well-circumscribed abscesses. In select clinical scenarios, conservative medical management may be a safe alternative to a combined surgical and medical approach. Unlike brain abscess, the incidence of spinal epidural abscess is on the rise and has been attributed to higher prevalence of predisposing factors, including spinal procedures and instrumentation.                                         SUMMARY               Successful diagnosis and management of brain abscess and spinal epidural abscess requires a collaborative approach among neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and infectious disease physicians. The foundation of management of brain abscess includes surgical intervention for diagnostic purposes if a pathogen has not been identified or for decompression of larger abscesses or those with mass effect and significant surrounding edema; appropriate dosing and adequate duration of an antimicrobial regimen tailored to the presumptive source of infection and available culture data, and eradication of the primary source of infection. For spinal epidural abscesses, neurologic status at the time of presentation is directly related to outcomes, underscoring the importance of prompt recognition and intervention.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis, the sexually transmissible stages of infection, has been on the rise for the past 2 decades. A concerning recent trend is the surge in cases of syphilis in women and of congenital syphilis. Neurosyphilis remains a relatively common complication that can occur at any stage of syphilis. Along with meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, which has been historically described as a late presentation of neurosyphilis, now frequently occurs as a manifestation of early infection. Late forms of neurosyphilis, including tabes dorsalis and general paresis, are less prevalent in the era of widespread penicillin use. As more laboratories adopt the reverse-sequence algorithm for syphilis testing, patients with serodiscordant results (ie, a reactive serum treponemal test with a nonreactive nontreponemal test) may present an increasingly encountered diagnostic challenge for neurologists. Although the CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) remains a mainstay of diagnostic testing for neurosyphilis, using a higher titer cutoff (greater than 1:320) for the                 Treponema pallidum                 particle agglutination assay (TPPA) from the CSF may improve the utility of the TPPA as a supporting criterion for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Penicillin G is the treatment of choice for neurosyphilis, although ceftriaxone may be a reasonable alternative therapy.                                                        SUMMARY               A high index of suspicion and awareness of the variable clinical presentations of neurosyphilis are essential to the approach to this treatable infection. Neurologists should be mindful of the limitations of serologic testing in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis and exercise clinical judgment to determine the likelihood of the diagnosis.},

Bacterial meningitis is usually lethal unless appropriate antibiotics that cross the blood-brain barrier are given. Clinical suspicion of bacterial meningitis begins when patients present with the abrupt onset of fever, headache, and meningismus.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               New technologies are being developed for more rapid identification of the bacterial species causing meningitis. When appropriate, administration of adjunctive dexamethasone with the antibiotics often lessens neurologic sequelae in survivors, which may include aphasia, ataxia, paresis, hearing loss, and cognitive impairment.                                         SUMMARY               Confirmation of the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis comes mainly from examination and culture of CSF obtained from a lumbar puncture. Typically, the CSF shows an elevated neutrophil count, elevated protein, depressed glucose, positive Gram stain, and growth of the bacteria on appropriate culture media. Antibiotic sensitivities of the bacteria determine the appropriate antibiotics, although an educated guess of the best antibiotics to be given promptly must be made until the antibiotic sensitivities return, usually in a few days.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Parasitic infections in humans are common, and many can affect the central nervous system where they may survive unnoticed or may cause significant pathology that can even lead to the death of the host. Neuroparasitoses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurologic lesions, particularly in individuals from endemic regions or those with a history of travel to endemic regions.                                         SUMMARY               Cerebral malaria is a significant cause of mortality, particularly in African children, in whom infected red blood cells affect the cerebral vessels, causing severe encephalopathy. Neurocysticercosis is the most common cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide and has varied clinical presentations, depending on the number, size, and location of the parasites in the nervous system as well as on the host's inflammatory response. Toxoplasmosis is distributed worldwide, affecting a significant proportion of the population, and may reactivate in patients who are immunosuppressed, causing encephalitis and focal abscesses. Schistosomiasis causes granulomatous lesions in the brain or the spinal cord.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Neurologic complications of HIV may be caused by direct virally mediated pathology, immune-mediated phenomena in response to viral infection, or opportunistic infections secondary to depletion of lymphocytes. These neurologic disorders may be influenced by the degree of immunosuppression (ie, CD4+ T-cell lymphocyte count) and stage of infection (early versus late), as well as use of antiretroviral therapy, and may manifest as a variety of central and peripheral neurologic syndromes, including the more commonly encountered HIV-associated cognitive disorders and length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy, respectively. Immune dysregulation underlies the majority of these neurologic phenomena, as well as other HIV-associated conditions including immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), CD8 lymphocytosis, and potentially the development of compartmentalized infection within the CSF, also referred to as                 CSF escape                 .

Although neuroborreliosis was first identified almost a century ago, much confusion remains about how to accurately diagnose this quite treatable nervous system infection. Well-established diagnostic tools and therapeutic regimens exist for neurosyphilis, which has been well-known for centuries.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Serologic testing targeting the C6 antigen may simplify diagnostic testing in neuroborreliosis while improving accuracy. Historically, screening for syphilis has used a reaginic test followed by a treponeme-specific assay; alternative approaches, including use of well-defined recombinant antigens, may improve sensitivity without sacrificing specificity. In neuroborreliosis, measurement of the chemokine CXCL13 in CSF may provide a useful marker of disease activity in the central nervous system.                                         SUMMARY               Lyme disease causes meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculitis, and mononeuropathy multiplex. Cognitive symptoms, occurring either during (encephalopathy) or after infection (posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome) are rarely, if ever, due to central nervous system infection. Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome is not antibiotic responsive. Syphilis causes meningitis, cranial neuritis, chronic meningovascular syphilis, tabes dorsalis, and parenchymal neurosyphilis. The organism remains highly sensitive to penicillin, but residua of chronic infection may be irreversible.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Rates of pyomyositis have increased recently in the United States, possibly because of an increase in risk factors such as IV drug use, obesity, and diabetes. Other peripheral nervous system infections, such as diphtheria, have become more common in older patients secondary to a lack of revaccination or waning immunity. Although recommended treatment regimens for most infections remain unchanged over recent years, debate over the ideal dosing and route of administration continues for some infections such as tetanus and leprosy (Hansen disease).                                         SUMMARY               Infections of the peripheral nervous system are varied in terms of the type of infection, localization, and potential treatment. Nerve conduction studies and EMG can help determine localization, which is key to determining an initial differential diagnosis.

RECENT FINDINGS               COVID-19 is the clinical syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It can affect the entire neuraxis, and presentations in the acute phase are variable, although anosmia is a common manifestation. Encephalopathy is common in patients who are hospitalized and is often associated with multiorgan involvement. Immune-mediated encephalitis is probably underrecognized; however, viral encephalitis is rare. Other manifestations include stroke, seizures, myelitis, and peripheral neuropathies, including Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, which sometimes has atypical manifestations. Treatment is symptomatic, and immunotherapies have been used successfully in some patients. Long-term complications include dysautonomia, exercise intolerance, malaise, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and mood disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 may occur in the acute setting and may be independent of respiratory manifestations.

RECENT FINDINGS               Contrary to popular belief, many congenital CNS infections are preventable and treatable. Treatment options exist for congenital cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis, although the efficacy of these treatments and the populations that may benefit from treatment are variable. Zika virus has recently emerged as a pathogen affecting the fetal brain, and new data suggest that the pathogenesis of Zika virus involves direct infection of neuronal progenitor cells leading to destruction of CNS tissue. The incidence of congenital syphilis has been increasing in the United States over the past decade as a direct result of new syphilis cases among adults and poor access to adequate maternal health care.                                         SUMMARY               Congenital CNS infections often result in significant neurologic morbidity in pediatric patients.

RECENT FINDINGS               The clinical presentations, associated neuroimaging findings, and CSF abnormalities of patients with central nervous system infections who are immunocompromised may differ from those of patients with central nervous system infections who are immunocompetent and may be confused with noninfectious processes. Triggering of brain autoimmunity with emergence of neurotropic antibodies has emerged as a recognized parainfectious complication. New unbiased metagenomic assays to identify obscure pathogens help clinicians navigate the increasing range of conditions affecting the growing population of patients with altered immunity.

RECENT FINDINGS               The most recent guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease were published in 2020 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American College of Rheumatology.                                         SUMMARY               The most common neurologic complications of Lyme disease are cranial neuritis (most often a unilateral or bilateral facial nerve palsy), meningitis, and radiculoneuritis/mononeuropathy multiplex. Testing for Lyme disease begins with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If the ELISA is positive or borderline, Western blots should be performed for both IgM and IgG antibodies. As a general rule, in infectious diseases, an IgM antibody response is followed by an IgG antibody response. A central nervous system infection has either a CSF pleocytosis or pathogen-specific intrathecal antibody production. Lyme meningitis, cranial neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy, or other peripheral nervous system manifestations are treated with oral doxycycline or IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin G. No additional antibiotic therapy is indicated for patients with posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome or patients with concern for chronic Lyme disease with no evidence of previous or current Lyme infection.},

However, neurologic complications of HIV remain common; can affect any part of the neuraxis; and are due to direct effects of the virus, immunosuppression because of untreated HIV infection, aberrant immune responses in the setting of ART initiation, and ART toxicities.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains one of the most common neurologic complications of HIV encountered today, but milder forms predominate in people on ART. No specific treatments for HAND exist, but small trials and epidemiologic evidence suggest paroxetine, intranasal insulin, and maraviroc may have utility in its treatment; further trials of these agents are ongoing. Widespread ART use has decreased the incidence of central nervous system opportunistic infections, but prognosis often remains poor in those who develop opportunistic infections. High-titer positive serum cryptococcal antigen is strongly predictive of cryptococcal meningitis and provides a tool to enhance diagnosis in areas with limited resources. HIV is an independent risk factor for stroke, and accelerated aging associated with HIV infection results in neurologic diseases of older age occurring at much younger ages in individuals infected with HIV. Ongoing HIV replication in the CSF despite peripheral virologic suppression may contribute to the development of HAND and may not improve despite adjusting the ART regimen to increase central nervous system penetrance.

RECENT FINDINGS                                Central nervous system (CNS) TB remains common and associated with significant mortality and neurologic sequelae worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection is strongly associated with both the development of and mortality due to CNS TB.                 Strongyloides                 co-infection is associated with reduced CNS inflammation and improved outcomes in the setting of tuberculous meningitis. Stroke remains a common complication of tuberculous meningitis, and emerging evidence suggests aspirin may be used in this context. Although a recent nucleic acid amplification test has demonstrated suboptimal sensitivity in the diagnosis of CNS TB, emerging diagnostic techniques include cell-free DNA, peripheral blood microRNA, metagenomic next-generation sequencing, and advanced imaging techniques, but these are not yet well validated. CNS TB is associated with high mortality even with current treatment regimens, although novel, promising strategies for treatment are under investigation, including a combination of IV isoniazid and ethambutol and high-dose rifampicin.                                                        SUMMARY               TB can affect the nervous system in various ways and is associated with high mortality. Diagnosis remains challenging in endemic settings, with empiric treatment often initiated without a definitive diagnosis. Furthermore, optimal treatment regimens remain uncertain because current treatment for all forms of CNS TB is extrapolated from trials of tuberculous meningitis whereas the role of steroids in people with HIV and tuberculous meningitis remains controversial.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               In recent years, we have observed the emergence and reemergence of a number of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Zika virus is the most recent addition to this group, first causing sporadic cases of uncomplicated febrile illness followed by sizeable outbreaks in the Pacific. However, the epidemiology and clinical features of Zika virus infection have changed rapidly and dramatically; it is now recognized as causing Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome (GBS) in children and adults and congenital abnormalities in infected fetuses. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of Zika virus--associated neurologic illness and briefly reviews features of West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Zika virus has emerged as a significant human pathogen in recent years. In 2015, it began to cause large outbreaks of febrile rash illness in South America and the Caribbean. During these large Zika virus outbreaks, a significant increase in the incidence of GBS was also observed in multiple countries/territories. Zika virus--associated GBS has several unique features, including a relatively short interval between febrile illness and GBS onset, an unusually high incidence among older people, and prominent cranial nerve abnormalities. Congenital Zika syndrome includes a myriad of abnormalities, including microcephaly, lissencephaly, hydrocephalus, arthrogryposis, and parenchymal calcifications. Currently, no treatment has been identified for Zika virus, although work on vaccines is under way.                                         SUMMARY               Arboviruses continue to surprise us with unexpected emergence in various locations, the nature of clinical illness, and outcomes. Zika virus presents a classic example of this type of emergence. Ongoing surveillance will be needed to evaluate the long-term pattern of Zika virus and related arboviruses.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Identification of the etiology of chronic meningitis remains challenging, with no cause identified in at least one-third of cases. Often, several serologic, CSF, and neuroimaging studies are indicated, although novel diagnostic platforms including metagenomic deep sequencing may hold promise for identifying organisms. Infectious etiologies are more common in those at risk for disseminated disease, specifically those who are immunocompromised because of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplantation, or immunosuppressant medications. An important step in identifying the etiology of chronic meningitis is assembling a multidisciplinary team of individuals, including those with specialized expertise in ophthalmology, dermatology, rheumatology, and infectious diseases, to provide guidance regarding diagnostic procedures.                                         SUMMARY               Chronic meningitis is defined as inflammation involving the meninges that lasts at least 4 weeks and is associated with a CSF pleocytosis. Chronic meningitis has numerous possible infectious and noninfectious etiologies, making it challenging to definitively diagnose patients. Therefore, a multifaceted approach that combines history, physical examination, neuroimaging, and laboratory analysis, including novel diagnostic platforms, is needed. This article focuses on key aspects of the evaluation of and approach to patients with chronic meningitis. Specific infectious etiologies and differential diagnoses of subacute and chronic meningitis, including noninfectious etiologies, are addressed.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article reviews infections of the brain parenchyma and includes an overview of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic approach, and management of infectious encephalitis and brain abscess.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The epidemiology of infectious encephalitis and brain abscess has changed in recent years. Vaccination has reduced the incidence of certain viruses associated with encephalitis, while a decrease in fulminant otogenic infections has led to fewer brain abscesses associated with otitis media. However, changes in climate and human population density and distribution have enabled the emergence of newer pathogens and expanded the geographic range of others, and greater adoption of intensive immunosuppressive regimens for autoimmune conditions has increased the risk of opportunistic infections of the brain. The widespread use of early neuroimaging, along with improved diagnostic methodologies for pathogen detection, newer antimicrobial therapies with better brain penetration, and less invasive neurosurgical techniques, has resulted in better outcomes for patients with infectious encephalitis and brain abscess. Novel technologies including metagenomic next-generation sequencing are increasingly being applied to these conditions in an effort to improve diagnosis. Nevertheless, both infectious encephalitis and brain abscess continue to be associated with substantial mortality.                                         SUMMARY               Infectious encephalitis and brain abscess can present as neurologic emergencies and require rapid assessment, thorough and appropriate diagnostic testing, and early initiation of empiric therapies directed against infectious agents. Close clinical follow-up, proper interpretation of diagnostic results, and appropriate tailoring of therapeutic agents are essential to optimizing outcomes. Diagnosis and management of parenchymal brain infections are complex and often best achieved with a multidisciplinary care team involving neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, infectious disease physicians, and pathologists.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article details the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis (TB), provides guidance for diagnostic imaging and CSF testing, and recommends treatment strategies for tuberculous meningitis and other forms of CNS TB, illustrating key aspects of diagnosis and management with case presentations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Although improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis and management of CNS TB have occurred over the past 50 years, the emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB, the advent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the subsequent availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy that can produce the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome have complicated the diagnosis and treatment of CNS TB. Advances in diagnostic assays promise to increase the speed of diagnosis as well as the percentage of people with a confirmed rather than a presumptive diagnosis. Advances in precision medicine have identified polymorphisms in the                 LTA4H                 gene that influence the risk for inflammation in patients with tuberculous meningitis.                                                        SUMMARY               CNS TB continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with the majority of people affected living in low-income and middle-income countries. Newer diagnostic assays promise to increase the speed of diagnosis and improve appropriate selection of antituberculous therapy and anti-inflammatory medications. Despite these advances, CNS TB remains difficult to diagnose, and clinicians should have a low threshold for initiating empiric therapy in patients with presumptive infection.},
