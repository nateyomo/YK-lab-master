  abstract = {Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is defined by a heart rate increment of 30 beats/min or more within 10 minutes of standing or head-up tilt in the absence of orthostatic hypotension; the standing heart rate is often 120 beats/min or higher. POTS manifests with symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion and excessive sympathoexcitation. The pathophysiology of POTS is heterogeneous and includes impaired sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction, excessive sympathetic drive, volume dysregulation, and deconditioning. POTS is frequently included in the differential diagnosis of chronic unexplained symptoms, such as inappropriate sinus tachycardia, chronic fatigue, chronic dizziness, or unexplained spells in otherwise healthy young individuals. Many patients with POTS also report symptoms not attributable to orthostatic intolerance, including those of functional gastrointestinal or bladder disorders, chronic headache, fibromyalgia, and sleep disturbances. In many of these cases, cognitive and behavioral factors, somatic hypervigilance associated with anxiety, depression, and behavioral amplification contribute to symptom chronicity. The aims of evaluation in patients with POTS are to exclude cardiac causes of inappropriate tachycardia; elucidate, if possible, the most likely pathophysiologic basis of postural intolerance; assess for the presence of treatable autonomic neuropathies; exclude endocrine causes of a hyperadrenergic state; evaluate for cardiovascular deconditioning; and determine the contribution of emotional and behavioral factors to the patient's symptoms. Management of POTS includes avoidance of precipitating factors, volume expansion, physical countermaneuvers, exercise training, pharmacotherapy (fludrocortisone, midodrine, {$\beta$}-blockers, and/or pyridostigmine), and behavioral-cognitive therapy. A literature search of PubMed for articles published from January 1, 1990, to June 15, 2012, was performed using the following terms (or combination of terms): POTS; postural tachycardia syndrome, orthostatic; orthostatic; syncope; sympathetic; baroreceptors; vestibulosympathetic; hypovolemia; visceral pain; chronic fatigue; deconditioning; headache; Chiari malformation; Ehlers-Danlos; emotion; amygdala; insula; anterior cingulate; periaqueductal gray; fludrocortisone; midodrine; propranolol; {$\beta$}-adrenergic; and pyridostigmine. Studies were limited to those published in English. Other articles were identified from bibliographies of the retrieved articles.},

  abstract = {Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder with multiple contributing pathophysiologic mechanisms manifesting as symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in the setting of orthostatic tachycardia (increase in heart rate by at least 30 beats per minute upon assuming an upright position) without orthostatic hypotension. The three major pathophysiologic mechanisms include partial autonomic neuropathy, hypovolemia, and hyperadrenergic state. Patients often will exhibit overlapping characteristics from more than one of these mechanisms. The approach to the treatment of POTS centers on treating the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism. Stockings, abdominal binders, and vasoconstrictors are used to enhance venous return in partial neuropathic POTS. Exercise and volume expansion are the main treatment strategies for hypo-volemic POTS. For hyperadrenergic POTS, beta-blockers and avoidance of norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors is important. Attempts should be made to discern which pathophysiologic mechanism(s) may be afflicting patients so that treatment regimens can be individualized.},

  abstract = {Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common form of autonomic dysregulation characterized as an excessive tachycardia upon standing in the presence of orthostatic intolerance. Current adult diagnostic criterion requires a heart rate increase~of greater than or equal to 30 bpm within the initial 10 minutes of standing or head-up tilt (HUT) in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. POTS predominantly affects premenopausal females (5 to 1) between 15 and 50 years of age, manifesting with symptoms of fatigue, headache, palpitations, sleep disturbance, nausea, bloating, among others. A multitude of pathophysiologic mechanisms including but not limited to disproportionate sympathoexcitation, volume depletion, autoimmune dysfunction, cardiac and physical deconditioning point to a heterogeneously complex etiology. Most significantly, the debilitating nature of POTS predisposes patients to a high degree of functional impairment and decreased quality of life, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the understanding and management of this increasingly prevalent clinical syndrome.},
