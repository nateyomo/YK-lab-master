  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               A tie between nutritional or gastrointestinal and neurologic disease has been recognized for centuries. Many gastrointestinal disorders are associated with neurologic disease through nutritional, immune-mediated, or degenerative pathophysiologies. This article reviews neurologic disorders in patients with gastrointestinal disease and gastrointestinal manifestations in their own neurologic patients.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS                                Development of new gastric and bariatric surgical procedures and the widespread use of over-the-counter gastric acid--reducing medications continue to create vitamin and nutritional deficiencies despite modern diet and supplementation. Some supplements, such as vitamin A, vitamin B                 6                 , and selenium, themselves are now found to cause disease. Recent work has shown extraintestinal and neurologic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. Chronic brain damage in liver disease has been recognized, and the opportunity to intervene may exist in the covert beginning stages. The characterization of gluten-related neurologic symptoms and differentiation from those of celiac disease is an evolving body of work.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               Gastrointestinal and neurologic diseases related to common immune-mediated, degenerative, or infectious mechanisms are common and can coexist in the same patient. Furthermore, gastrointestinal disease may cause neurologic complications because of nutritional inadequacies, malabsorption, and hepatic dysfunction. In many cases, the complications are treatable but have subtle or protean presentations. Therefore, the consulting neurologist must be current in knowledge of the growing ties between gastrointestinal and neurologic disease.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               Neurologic complications are a major contributor to death and disability in patients with renal disease. Oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, accelerated arteriosclerosis, and uremic inflammatory milieu affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. This article reviews the unique contributions of renal impairment to neurologic disorders and their common clinical manifestations as the prevalence of renal disease increases in a globally aging population.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENT                                Advances in the understanding of the pathophysiologic interplay between the kidneys and brain, also referred to as the                 kidney-brain axis                 , have led to more widespread recognition of associated changes in neurovascular dynamics, central nervous system acidification, and uremia-associated endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Acute kidney injury increases mortality in acute brain injury to nearly 5 times that seen in matched controls. Renal impairment and its associated increased risks of intracerebral hemorrhage and accelerated cognitive decline are developing fields. Dialysis-associated neurovascular injury is increasingly recognized in both continuous and intermittent forms of renal replacement therapy, and treatment strategies for its prevention are evolving.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               This article summarizes the effects of renal impairment on the central and peripheral nervous systems with special considerations in acute kidney injury, patients requiring dialysis, and conditions that affect both the renal and nervous systems.},

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of neurologic complications of COVID-19 began to surface. A variety of neurologic conditions have since been reported in association with COVID-19. Understanding of the underlying mechanism of COVID-19 neurologic involvement continues to evolve; however, the evidence seems to suggest that aberrant inflammatory responses may play a role. In addition to neurologic symptoms in acute COVID-19, neurologic post--COVID-19 conditions are increasingly recognized. The development of COVID-19 vaccines has been essential in preventing the spread of COVID-19. With increasing numbers of vaccine doses administered, various neurologic adverse events have been reported.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Neurologists must be aware of the potential acute, postacute, and vaccine-associated neurologic complications associated with COVID-19 and be poised to serve as integral members of multidisciplinary care teams for patients with COVID-19--related conditions.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The diagnosis and management of hyponatremia continue to evolve. Diagnostic accuracy is improved by assessing serum and urine osmolality as well as urinary sodium. Avoiding overcorrection of hyponatremia is crucial to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome, although even careful correction can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome in patients who have other risk factors. The clinical presentation of osmotic demyelination syndrome has expanded, with many patients presenting with extrapontine myelinolysis in addition to central pontine myelinolysis.                                         SUMMARY               Electrolyte disorders often present with neurologic manifestations. Whereas disorders of some electrolytes, such as sodium, preferentially affect the central nervous system, disorders of others, such as potassium and calcium, have significant neuromuscular manifestations. An understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders and recognition of these manifestations are crucial for the practicing neurologist as the symptoms are reversible with correct management.},

This article describes the neurologic complications that are commonly encountered in patients who are critically ill from medical diseases and presents strategies for their diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Chronic neurologic disability is common after critical medical illness and is a major factor in the quality of life for survivors of critical illness. Studies that carefully assessed groups of patients with general critical illness have identified a substantial rate of covert seizures, brain infarcts, muscle wasting, peripheral nerve injuries, and other neurologic sequelae that are strong predictors of poor neurologic outcomes. As the population ages and intensive care survivorship increases, critical illness--related neurologic impairments represent a large and growing proportion of the overall burden of neurologic disease.

The cardiorespiratory system is responsible for the delivery of oxygen and energy substrates to the brain. Therefore, diseases of the heart and lungs can lead to various neurologic illnesses. This article reviews various cardiac and pulmonary pathologies that can lead to neurologic injury and discusses the relevant pathophysiologic mechanisms.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               We have lived through unprecedented times over the past 3 years with the emergence and rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the effects of COVID-19 on the lungs and heart, an increased incidence of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and stroke associated with cardiorespiratory pathologies has been observed. Newer evidence has questioned the benefit of induced hypothermia in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Further, global collaborative initiatives such as the Curing Coma Campaign are underway with the goal of improving the care of patients with coma and disorders of consciousness, including those resulting from cardiac and pulmonary pathologies.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               The neurologic complications of cardiorespiratory disorders are common and present in various forms such as stroke or hypoxic and anoxic injury related to cardiac or respiratory failure. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, neurologic complications have increased in recent years. Given the intimate and interdependent dynamics of the heart, lungs, and brain, it is crucial for neurologists to be aware of the interplay between these organs.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Systemic autoimmune diseases can be associated with a wide spectrum of neurologic comorbidities involving the central and peripheral nervous systems. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be associated with a number of manifestations predominantly affecting the central nervous system (CNS), whereas peripheral neuropathy is less common. Sj{\"o}gren syndrome can be associated with peripheral neuropathy in 10\% of cases and CNS disease in 2\% to 5\% of cases. The risk of stroke is increased in SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Systemic vasculitides present most commonly with mononeuritis multiplex but can also affect the CNS. Cognitive dysfunction is a common symptom among patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, most commonly seen in patients with SLE or Sj{\"o}gren syndrome.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologic manifestations of systemic autoimmune disease are important to recognize, as they may often be the presenting manifestation leading to diagnosis of the systemic disease or may be associated with increased morbidity, other complications, or mortality. Timely diagnosis and institution of appropriate treatment, often requiring multidisciplinary care, is essential to minimize morbidity and decrease the risk of permanent neurologic deficits.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                The 2018 Neurosarcoidosis Consortium diagnostic criteria emphasize that biopsy is key for diagnosis and determines the level of diagnostic certainty. Thus,                 definite neurosarcoidosis                 requires nervous system biopsy and                 probable neurosarcoidosis                 requires biopsy from extraneural tissue. Without biopsy,                 possible neurosarcoidosis                 can be diagnosed if the clinical, imaging, and laboratory picture is compatible and other causes are ruled out. Recent large retrospective studies from the United States and France established that infliximab appears to be efficacious when other treatments are inadequate.                                                        SUMMARY                                Sarcoidosis is a multisystem noninfectious granulomatous disorder that is immune mediated, reflecting the response to an as-yet unidentified antigen or antigens. Neurosarcoidosis refers to neurologic involvement due to sarcoidosis that clinically manifests in 5\% of cases of sarcoidosis, with asymptomatic involvement in as many as another one in five patients with sarcoidosis. Sarcoid granulomas can occur in any anatomic substrate in the nervous system, causing protean manifestations that have earned neurosarcoidosis the sobriquet                 the great mimic                 . Nevertheless, central nervous system sarcoidosis occurs in well-defined presentations that can be classified as cranial neuropathies, meningeal disease, brain parenchymal (including pituitary-hypothalamic) disease, and spinal cord disease. In addition, the peripheral nervous system is affected in the form of peripheral neuropathy and myopathy. Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of treatment, especially in the acute stage, whereas steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine are used for prolonged therapy to minimize steroid toxicity. Anti--tumor necrosis factor agents may help in refractory cases.},

This review summarizes potential neurologic complications in patients who have undergone treatment for neurologic and systemic malignancies.                                         Latest Developments               Radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy along with other targeted therapies continue to be the mainstay of cancer treatment. These advances in cancer care have led to improved outcomes and increased the need to understand the spectrum of neurologic complications that may arise from treatment. While radiation and older therapies including cytotoxic chemotherapies have side effect profiles that are widely known and well understood, this article serves as a review of the more commonly associated neurologic complications of both traditional and newer treatments being offered to this patient population.                                         Essential Points               Neurotoxicity is a common complication of cancer-directed treatment. In general, neurologic complications of radiation therapy are more common in central nervous system malignancies, and neurologic complications of chemotherapy are more common in non-neurologic malignancies. Attempts at prevention, early detection, and intervention remain paramount in the reduction of neurologic morbidity.},

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Although the mechanisms of many of the neurologic complications discussed here remain unclear, our understanding of the impacts of diabetes and hypothyroidism on the nervous system and muscle, including complications of rapid correction of chronic hyperglycemia, has advanced in recent years. Recent large studies have not demonstrated a convincing association between subclinical or overt hypothyroidism and cognitive decline.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Neurologists must become familiar with the neurologic complications of endocrine disorders not only because they are common and treatable (and often reversible) but also because they may be iatrogenic, as is the case with adrenal insufficiency in the setting of long-term corticosteroid therapy.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Whereas neurologic complications from traditional chemotherapy are widely recognized, newer cancer therapies, in particular immunotherapies, have unique and distinct patterns of neurologic adverse effects. Anticancer drugs may cause central or peripheral nervous system complications. Neurologic complications of therapy are being seen with increasing frequency as patients with cancer are living longer and receiving multiple courses of anticancer regimens, with novel agents, combinations, and longer duration. Neurologists must know how to recognize treatment-related neurologic toxicity since discontinuation of the offending agent or dose adjustment may prevent further or permanent neurologic injury. It is also imperative to differentiate neurologic complications of therapy from cancer progression into the nervous system and from comorbid neurologic disorders that do not require treatment dose reduction or discontinuation.                                         SUMMARY               Neurotoxicity from cancer therapy is common, with effects seen on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy are new cancer treatments with distinct patterns of neurologic complications. Early recognition and appropriate management are essential to help prevent further neurologic injury and optimize oncologic management.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The manufacture, distribution, and use of so-called designer drugs are increasing. These agents can induce dramatic neurologic manifestations and can evade identification on conventional drug-screening assays. Additionally, gabapentinoids, drug agents that are very familiar to neurologists, are being abused in the general population at increasing rates to achieve euphoric highs and potentiate the effects of opiates. Furthermore, even well-known illicit narcotics such as heroin are posing dangers above their baseline because of ``lacing'' with additives or substitutes such as fentanyl and related compounds. These clandestine agents increase the potency of what are thought to be typical dosages to lethal levels, thus leading to more unintentional overdose deaths.                                         SUMMARY               The potential for short- and long-term nervous system injury from drug abuse is well established. However, it is important for the practicing neurologist to possess awareness of the features and observed sequelae of the toxidromes of both traditional and nontraditional drugs of abuse. This is because the use of both is widespread in our society and conventional drug screening can miss detection of some powerful agents, thus forcing us to maintain a high index of suspicion based on recognition of the clinical features.},

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and similar derivatives have exploded in prevalence, becoming the leading cause of overdose fatalities. The higher potency of synthetic opioids compared with semisynthetic and nonsynthetic opiates poses an increased risk for unintentional overdose when found as an adulterant in other illicit drug supplies such as heroin. Conversely, misinformation about the risk of symptomatic exposure to fentanyl through casual contact with the skin and ambient air has led to misdirected fear and stigma that threatens to impede valid harm-reduction measures for fentanyl users at risk of actual overdose. Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, overdose rates and deaths continued to climb, especially among those who use opioids and methamphetamine.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               A variety of potential neurologic effects and injuries can occur with illicit drug use owing to the diverse properties and mechanisms of action of the various classes. Many high-risk agents are not detected on standard drug screens, including so-called designer drugs, and the practicing neurologist is best served by recognizing the clinical features of the traditional toxidrome and other potential idiosyncratic effects of various illicit agents.},

Latest Developments               Although most have historically been classified as autoimmune disorders, rheumatologic diseases are increasingly conceptualized as distributed along a spectrum with various contributions of autoimmune (adaptive immune dysregulation) and autoinflammatory (innate immune dysregulation) mechanisms. Our evolving understanding of systemic immune-mediated disorders has been accompanied by an expansion in our differential diagnoses and therapeutic options.                                         Essential Points               Rheumatologic disease involves both autoimmune and autoinflammatory mechanisms. Neurologic symptoms can be the first manifestation of these disorders, and familiarity with the systemic manifestations of specific diseases is essential to establish the correct diagnosis. Conversely, knowledge of the neurologic syndromes that are most likely to be associated with specific systemic disorders can help narrow the differential and increase confidence when attributing a neuropsychiatric symptom to an underlying systemic disorder.},

This article aims to help clinicians recognize neurologic adverse drug reactions of a range of medication classes.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Adverse drug reactions are a source of significant morbidity and rising health care costs. Failure to recognize neurologic adverse drug reactions may prompt unnecessary testing to identify a primary neurologic condition and expose the patient to continued adverse effects of a medication. Familiarity with the side effect profiles of newer medications, timing of side effects, pattern of reaction, medication rechallenge, and concurrent medical issues and awareness of significant medication interactions may aid in the identification of a medication side effect.                                         SUMMARY               Early recognition of neurologic adverse medication reactions can be challenging but is essential to prompt discontinuation of the offending medication or administration of specific symptomatic treatments in select cases. A high index of suspicion is needed to arrive at the correct diagnosis promptly, initiate a treatment plan, limit unnecessary testing, and reduce overall health care cost burden.},
