  abstract = {Since the 18th century, the p value has been an important part of hypothesis-based scientific investigation. As statistical and data science engines accelerate, questions emerge: to what extent are scientific discoveries based on p values reliable and reproducible? Should one adjust the significance level or find alternatives for the p value? Inspired by these questions and everlasting attempts to address them, here, we provide a systematic examination of the p value from its roles and merits to its misuses and misinterpretations. For the latter, we summarize modest recommendations to handle them. In parallel, we present the Bayesian alternatives for seeking evidence and discuss the pooling of p values from multiple studies and datasets. Overall, we argue that the p value and hypothesis testing form a useful probabilistic decision-making mechanism, facilitating causal inference, feature selection, and predictive modeling, but that the interpretation of the p value must be contextual, considering the scientific question, experimental design, and statistical principles.},

  abstract = {Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This eighth installment of Explorations in Statistics explores permutation methods, empiric procedures we can use to assess an experimental result-to test a null hypothesis-when we are reluctant to trust statistical theory alone. Permutation methods operate on the observations-the data-we get from an experiment. A permutation procedure answers this question: out of all the possible ways we can rearrange the observations we got, in what proportion of those arrangements is the sample statistic we care about at least as extreme as the one we got? The answer to that question is the P value.},

  abstract = {Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This eleventh installment of Explorations in Statistics explores statistical facets of reproducibility. If we obtain an experimental result that is scientifically meaningful and statistically unusual, we would like to know that our result reflects a general biological phenomenon that another researcher could reproduce if (s)he repeated our experiment. But more often than not, we may learn this researcher cannot replicate our result. The National Institutes of Health and the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology have created training modules and outlined strategies to help improve the reproducibility of research. These particular approaches are necessary, but they are not sufficient. The principles of hypothesis testing and estimation are inherent to the notion of reproducibility in science. If we want to improve the reproducibility of our research, then we need to rethink how we apply fundamental concepts of statistics to our science.},

  abstract = {Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This second installment of Explorations in Statistics delves into test statistics and P values, two concepts fundamental to the test of a scientific null hypothesis. The essence of a test statistic is that it compares what we observe in the experiment to what we expect to see if the null hypothesis is true. The P value associated with the magnitude of that test statistic answers this question: if the null hypothesis is true, what proportion of possible values of the test statistic are at least as extreme as the one I got? Although statisticians continue to stress the limitations of hypothesis tests, there are two realities we must acknowledge: hypothesis tests are ingrained within science, and the simple test of a null hypothesis can be useful. As a result, it behooves us to explore the notions of hypothesis tests, test statistics, and P values.},
