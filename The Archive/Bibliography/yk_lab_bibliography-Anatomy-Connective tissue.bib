  abstract = {An understanding of knee ligament anatomy and biomechanics is foundational for physicians treating knee injuries, especially the more rare and morbid multiligamentous knee injuries. This chapter examines the roles that the cruciate and collateral anatomy and morphology play in their kinematics. Additionally, the biomechanics of the ACL, PCL, MCL, and LCL are discussed as they have surgical and reconstructive implications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ligamentum teres (LT) consists of two bands that originate on the ischial and pubic sides of the acetabular notch and insert on the fovea capitis of the femoral head. Recent studies have established the LT as an important hip stabilizer in a squatting position, particularly in patients with osseous instability. PURPOSE: This review aims to concisely present the literature on LT tendinopathy and tears in order to guide health care professionals in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on the diagnosis and surgical management of ligamentum teres tendinopathy and tears. CONCLUSIONS: The ligamentum teres is an important stabilizer to the hip joint, particularly with hip flexion and external rotation. Older age and acetabular bony pathomorphology are two of the known risk factors for LT tears. Symptoms of LT tendinopathy are largely non-specific, mimicking a wide range of other hip disorders including impingement and instability. Debridement of LT tears or reactive tissue has been reported with good outcomes, with more recent studies describing reconstruction of a completely torn, nonfunctional, or absent LT using various graft sources including synthetic grafts, autografts, and allografts. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.},

  abstract = {The two functional bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), namely, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles, must work in concert to control displacement of the tibia relative to the femur for complex motions. Thus, the replacement graft(s) for a torn ACL should possess similar tension patterns. The objective of the study was to examine whether a double-bundle ACL reconstruction with the semitendinosus-gracilis autografts could replicate the tension patterns of those for the intact ACL under controlled in vitro loading conditions. By means of a robotic/universal force moment sensor (UFS) testing system, the in situ force vectors (both magnitude and direction) for the AM and PL bundles of the ACL, as well as their respective replacement grafts, were determined and compared on nine human cadaveric knees. It was found that double-bundle ACL reconstruction could closely replicate the in situ force vectors. Under a 134-N anterior tibial load, the resultant force vectors for the intact ACL and the reconstructed ACL had a difference of 5 to 11 N (p {$>$} 0.05) in magnitude and 1 to 13 degrees (p {$>$} 0.05) in direction. Whereas, under combined rotatory loads of 10-N-m valgus and 5-N-m internal tibial torques, the corresponding differences were 10 to 16 N and 4 degrees to 11 degrees, respectively. Again, there were no statistically significant differences except at 30 degrees of flexion where the force vector for the AM graft had a 15 degrees (p {$<$} 0.05) lower elevation angle than did the AM bundle.},
