  abstract = {For many years articular cartilage has been the focus of research aimed at improving understanding of and treatment for osteoarthritis. Although much is known about the tissue, research has had little success in elucidating the pathogenesis of generalised osteoarthritis. A new hypothesis is required. Substantial changes in many tissues, including bone, muscle, ligaments, and joint capsule, as well as cartilage, are increasingly recognised in this disease, and not all these changes are localised to the affected joints. There is also a well established link with obesity. These observations, the common origins of the mesenchymal cells that maintain these tissues, and the possible role of neuroendocrine factors that can regulate bone mass, result in the hypothesis that systemic factors that include altered lipid metabolism could explain the diversity of physiological changes in generalised osteoarthritis. If proven, this hypothesis could have important implications for a new approach to pharmacological intervention in the early stages of the disease.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The medicinal treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) is mostly symptomatic to relieve pain and incapacity with analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), drugs with well-known risks. Complementary medicines might reduce the symptoms of OA and decrease the need for NSAIDs. This study tested the effects of a food supplement, Phytalgic, on pain and function in patients with osteoarthritis and their use of analgesic and NSAIDs. METHODS: A randomized double-blind parallel-groups clinical trial compared Phytalgic (fish-oil, vitamin E, Urtica dioica) to a placebo for three months, in 81 patients with OA of the knee or hip using NSAIDs and/or analgesics regularly. The main outcome measures were use of NSAIDs (in Defined Daily Doses per day - DDD/day) or analgesics (in 500 mg paracetamol-equivalent tablets per week (PET/week) measured each month, and Western Ontario-McMaster University Osteo-Arthritis Index (WOMAC) function scales. RESULTS: After three months of treatment, the mean use of analgesics in the active arm (6.5 PET/week) vs. the placebo arm (16.5) was significantly different (P {$<$} 0.001) with a group mean difference of -10.0 (95\% CI: -4.9 to -15.1). That of NSAIDs in the active arm (0.4 DDD/day) vs the placebo arm (1.0 DDD/day) was significantly different (P = 0.02) with a group mean difference of - 0.7 DDD/day (95\% CI: -0.2 to -1.2). Mean WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness and function in the active arm (respectively 86.5, 41.4 and 301.6) vs the placebo arm (resp. 235.3, 96.3 and 746.5) were significantly different (P {$<$} 0.001) with group mean differences respectively of -148.8 (95\% CI: -97.7 to -199.9), -54.9 (95\% CI: -27.9 to -81.9) and -444.8 (95\% CI: -269.1 to -620.4). CONCLUSIONS: The food supplement tested appeared to decrease the need for analgesics and NSAIDs and improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00666523.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Few studies have investigated the role of dietary factors on knee osteoarthritis (OA) progression. We examined the prospective association of dietary fat intake with radiographic progression of knee OA. METHODS: In the Osteoarthritis Initiative, 2,092 participants with radiographic knee OA and having baseline dietary data were followed at yearly intervals up to 48 months. Dietary intakes of fatty acids were assessed with the Block Brief Food Frequency Questionnaire. To evaluate radiographic progression of knee OA, we used quantitative joint space width (JSW) between the medial femur and tibia of the knee based on fixed-flexion posteroanterior radiographs. Linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to test the association between dietary fat and JSW loss over time. RESULTS: We observed significant positive relationships of total fat and saturated fatty acids (SFA) intakes with JSW loss. With increasing quartiles of total fat intake, JSW decreases over 48 months were 0.26 mm, 0.27 mm, 0.31 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively (P\,=\,0.02 for trend). Similar association was observed between SFA intake and JSW loss. In contrast, higher intakes of mono- (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and higher ratio of PUFA to SFA were associated with a reduced JSW loss. CONCLUSION: High intakes of total fat and SFA may be associated with increased structural knee OA progression, while MUFA and PUFA may reduce radiographic progression. Replication of these novel findings in other prospective studies is needed to confirm if reduction in SFA intake and increase in unsaturated fat intake lead to delayed knee OA progression.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are characterized by abnormal lipid metabolism manifested as altered fatty acid (FA) profiles of synovial fluid and tissues and in the way dietary FA supplements can influence the symptoms of especially RA. In addition to classic eicosanoids, the potential roles of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA)-derived specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM) have become the focus of intensive research. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge of the roles of FA and oxylipins in the degradation or protection of synovial joints. RECENT FINDINGS: There exists discordance between the large body of literature from cell culture and animal experiments on the adverse and beneficial effects of individual FA and the lack of effective treatments for joint destruction in OA and RA patients. Saturated 16:0 and 18:0 induce mostly deleterious effects, while long-chain n-3 PUFA, especially 20:5n-3, have positive influence on joint health. The situation can be more complex for n-6 PUFA, such as 18:2n-6, 20:4n-6, and its derivative prostaglandin E2, with a combination of potentially adverse and beneficial effects. SPM analogs have future potential as analgesics for arthritic pain. Alterations in FA profiles and their potential implications in SPM production may affect joint lubrication, synovial inflammation, pannus formation, as well as cartilage and bone degradation and contribute to the pathogeneses of inflammatory joint diseases. Further research directions include high-quality randomized controlled trials on dietary FA supplements and investigations on the significance of lipid composition of microvesicle membrane and cargo in joint diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is strongly linked with obesity and patients with osteoporosis (OP) have a low body mass index. Anecdotal evidence, clinical and laboratory, suggests that OA bone contains more fat. However, conversion of osteoblasts to adipocytes is reported in OP and this would suggest that the more porous OP cancellous bone would have a high fat content. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that OA bone contains more fat than OP bone. METHODS: Cores of cancellous bone were obtained from femoral heads of patients undergoing surgery for either OA or OP. Lipids were extracted using chloroform-methanol, weighed and expressed as a fraction of core mass and volume. A fatty acid analysis was performed using gas chromatography. RESULTS: OA bone contained twice as much fat per unit volume of tissue as OP. Levels of n-6 fatty acids were elevated in OA, especially arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6) which was almost double that found in OP. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that lipids may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of OA and may provide part of the key to understanding why OA and OP lie at opposite ends of the spectrum of bone masses.},

Since diet may potentially affect OA, we reviewed the literature on the relationship between nutrition and OA risk or progression, aiming to provide guidance for clinicians. For overweight/obese patients, weight reduction, ideally incorporating exercise, is paramount. The association between metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes and OA risk or progression may partly explain the apparent benefit of dietary-lipid modification resulting from increased consumption of long-chain omega-3 fatty-acids from oily fish/fish oil supplements. A strong association between OA and raised serum cholesterol together with clinical effects in statin users suggests a potential benefit of reduction of cholesterol by dietary means. Patients should ensure that they meet the recommended intakes for micronutrients such as vitamin K, which has a role in bone/cartilage mineralization. Evidence for a role of vitamin D supplementation in OA is unconvincing.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that exercise interventions are more effective than no exercise control and to compare the effectiveness of different exercise interventions in relieving pain and improving function in patients with lower limb osteoarthritis. DATA SOURCES: Nine electronic databases searched from inception to March 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials comparing exercise interventions with each other or with no exercise control for adults with knee or hip osteoarthritis. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers evaluated eligibility and methodological quality. Main outcomes extracted were pain intensity and limitation of function. Trial sequential analysis was used to investigate reliability and conclusiveness of available evidence for exercise interventions. Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to combine both direct (within trial) and indirect (between trial) evidence on treatment effectiveness. RESULTS: 60 trials (44 knee, two hip, 14 mixed) covering 12 exercise interventions and with 8218 patients met inclusion criteria. Sequential analysis showed that as of 2002 sufficient evidence had been accrued to show significant benefit of exercise interventions over no exercise control. For pain relief, strengthening, flexibility plus strengthening, flexibility plus strengthening plus aerobic, aquatic strengthening, and aquatic strengthening plus flexibility, exercises were significantly more effective than no exercise control. A combined intervention of strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic exercise was also significantly more effective than no exercise control for improving limitation in function (standardised mean difference -0.63, 95\% credible interval -1.16 to -0.10). CONCLUSIONS: As of 2002 sufficient evidence had accumulated to show significant benefit of exercise over no exercise in patients with osteoarthritis, and further trials are unlikely to overturn this result. An approach combining exercises to increase strength, flexibility, and aerobic capacity is likely to be most effective in the management of lower limb osteoarthritis. The evidence is largely from trials in patients with knee osteoarthritis. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) No CRD42012002267.},
