The first seven chapters explain anatomical orientation, tissues, bone, the axial and appendicular skeletons, joints, and skeletal muscle and fascia. The last two chapters illustrate the muscle groups of the body's four major regions detailing each region's deep and superficial muscles in both anterior and posterior views. Tables show each muscle's origin, insertion, innervation, and action"--},
