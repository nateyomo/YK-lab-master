  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interval throwing programs are used in rehabilitation of throwing injuries, especially ulnar collateral ligament injuries. Athletes who are rehabilitating begin by throwing on flat ground progressing through increasing distances, number of throws, and intensity of throwing. If the athlete is a baseball pitcher, the flat-ground throwing phase is followed by pitching on a mound at progressively increased effort. The goal is to build back arm strength and capacity with an emphasis on proper mechanics. PURPOSE: To determine whether interval throwing progressively builds joint kinetics (specifically, elbow varus torque) to the level required during full-effort baseball pitching. A secondary purpose was to examine the kinematics produced during interval throwing compared to those seen during baseball pitching. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Review. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and Google Scholar were systematically searched for biomechanical studies of flat-ground throwing and partial-effort pitching in baseball between 1987 and 2023. Studies that reported the biomechanics of either flat-ground throwing, or partial-effort pitching were included in this review. The AXIS tool was used to assess study quality. RESULTS: Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Ten studies were determined to be of moderate quality, while three studies were deemed high quality. Elbow varus torque during partial-effort pitching was less than during full-effort pitching. Elbow varus torque for most flat-ground throws did not exceed full-effort pitching torque. While most studies showed increased elbow varus torque with increased flat-ground throwing distance, the distance at which elbow varus torque matched or exceeded full-effort pitching elbow varus torque was not consistent.As flat-ground throwing distance increased, shoulder external rotation angle and shoulder internal rotation velocity increased. Arm slot (forearm angle above horizontal) decreased as flat-ground throwing distance increased. For varied effort pitching, shoulder external rotation angle, shoulder internal rotation velocity, elbow extension velocity, and ball velocity increased as effort increased. While the front knee extended slightly from foot contact to ball release in full-effort pitching, the front knee flexed slightly during partial-effort pitching. CONCLUSIONS: An interval throwing program progressively builds elbow varus torque up to levels produced in full-effort baseball pitching. While differences exist between interval throwing kinematics and pitching kinematics, the patterns are similar in general. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Improper baseball pitching biomechanics are associated with increased stresses on the throwing elbow and shoulder as well as an increased risk of injury. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Previous studies quantifying pitching kinematics and kinetics were reviewed. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5. RESULTS: At the instant of lead foot contact, the elbow should be flexed approximately 90{$^\circ$} with the shoulder at about 90{$^\circ$} abduction, 20{$^\circ$} horizontal abduction, and 45{$^\circ$} external rotation. The stride length should be about 85\% of the pitcher's height with the lead foot in a slightly closed position. The pelvis should be rotated slightly open toward home plate with the upper torso in line with the pitching direction. Improper shoulder external rotation at foot contact is associated with increased elbow and shoulder torques and forces and may be corrected by changing the stride length and/or arm path. From foot contact to maximum shoulder external rotation to ball release, the pitcher should demonstrate a kinematic chain of lead knee extension, pelvis rotation, upper trunk rotation, elbow extension, and shoulder internal rotation. The lead knee should be flexed about 45{$^\circ$} at foot contact and 30{$^\circ$} at ball release. Corrective strategies for insufficient knee extension may involve technical issues (stride length, lead foot position, lead foot orientation) and/or strength and conditioning of the lower body. Improper pelvis and upper trunk rotation often indicate the need for core strength and flexibility. Maximum shoulder external rotation should be about 170{$^\circ$}. Insufficient external rotation leads to low shoulder internal rotation velocity and low ball velocity. Deviation from 90{$^\circ$} abduction decreases the ability to achieve maximum external rotation, increases elbow torque, and decreases the dynamic stability in the glenohumeral joint. CONCLUSION: Improved pitching biomechanics can increase performance and reduce risk of injury. SORT: Level C.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations in glenohumeral internal rotation (GIR), glenohumeral external rotation (GER), and the total arc of motion (TAM) have been linked with increased injury risk in the shoulder and elbow. These motions have been routinely measured with the forearm in neutral rotation (GIRN, GERN, TAMN). GER capacity appears to be especially important. The throwing motion, however, requires forearm pronation as GER occurs to achieve optimal cocking (GERP). No previous studies have evaluated GERP to determine GER capacity or pronated TAM (TAMP) values. HYPOTHESIS: There would be significant differences between GERN and TAMN and between GERP and TAMP. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3. METHODS: Sixty asymptomatic male Minor League Baseball players (32 pitchers, 28 position players) participated in the study and were tested on the first day of spring training. Passive range of motion measurements were recorded using a long-arm bubble goniometer for GIRN, GERN, and GERP on both arms. TAM was calculated separately as the sum of internal and external rotational measurements under neutral and pronated conditions. RESULTS: Within pitchers and position players, all measurements were statistically reduced for the throwing arm (P {$\leq$} 0.03) except for GERN of the pitchers. GERP measures were significantly less than GERN for both arms of each group (P {$<$} 0.01): pitchers throwing arm +11.8{$^\circ$}/nonthrowing arm +4.8{$^\circ$}, position players throwing arm = +8.6{$^\circ$}/nonthrowing arm +4.0{$^\circ$}. CONCLUSION: The forearm position of pronation, which appears to be mediated by tightness of the biceps, decreases GER capacity and TAM. GER and TAM should be calculated in neutral and pronated positions, considering that 80\% of the players have a demonstrated difference between 8{$^\circ$} and 12{$^\circ$}. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Measurement of GERP more accurately reflects the GER required in throwing, allows better quantification of the motion capacity necessary to withstand the loads in throwing, and may suggest interventions for at risk athletes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elite throwing athletes have increased proximal humeral retrotorsion (HRT) and glenoid retroversion (GRV) in their throwing shoulders compared with their nonthrowing shoulders. These adaptive morphologic changes are thought to be independently protective against shoulder injury; however, their relationship to each other is poorly understood. PURPOSE: To determine if an association exists between HRT and GRV within the same shoulders of professional pitchers. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The HRT and GRV measurements were determined using published techniques in asymptomatic bilateral shoulders of 32 professional pitchers (mean age, 23 years). Three measurements for each variable were averaged, and the reliability of the techniques was verified. The relationship between HRT and GRV within the same shoulders was determined with Pearson correlation coefficients. Paired t tests were used to compare HRT and GRV between the throwing and nonthrowing shoulder. Simple ratios were calculated between HRT and GRV. RESULTS: Humeral retrotorsion and GRV were both significantly greater on the throwing side compared with the nonthrowing side (HRT: throwing = 9.0{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 11.4{$^\circ$} and nonthrowing = 22.1{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 10.7{$^\circ$}, P {$<$} .001; GRV: throwing = 8.6{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 6.0{$^\circ$} and nonthrowing = 4.9{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 4.8{$^\circ$}, P = .001). Within the same shoulders, there was a statistically significant positive association between HRT and GRV on the throwing side (r = 0.43, P = .016) but not on the nonthrowing side (r = -0.13, P = .50). The HRT:GRV ratio was 2.3:1 for throwing shoulders and 7:1 for nonthrowing shoulders. CONCLUSION: The concurrent increases in dominant shoulder HRT and GRV were observed as a 2:1 "thrower's ratio." As this relationship was not observed on the nondominant shoulder, it suggests that bony adaptation of the proximal humerus and glenoid are coupled during skeletal development in the throwing shoulder. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.},
