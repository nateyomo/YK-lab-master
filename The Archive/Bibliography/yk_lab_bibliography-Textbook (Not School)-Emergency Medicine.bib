Each chapter reviews epidemiology, anatomy, mechanism of injury, clinical evaluation, imaging (which includes the formal classification systems used to name and grade fracture types), non-operative and operative treatment, and complications. This title is an almost obligatory purchase for first-year orthopaedic residents, and is also purchased in substantial numbers by other specialties involved in fracture care, including Pas and NPs in either orthopaedic or emergency medicine settings. It is very simply written, and many of the illustrations are derived from the Rockwood and Green franchise. Importantly, this title covers adult and pediatric fractures, and is thus usable in primary care, especially family practice settings"-- Provided by publisher},
