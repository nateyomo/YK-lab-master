  abstract = {The Bunkie test, a functional performance test consisting of 5 test positions (performed bilaterally), has been used to assess aspects of muscular function. Current performance measures are based on clinical recommendations. The purpose of this study was to report normative data for a healthy population. One hundred and twelve subjects (mean age                                25.9                 {\textpm}                 4.5                              years) were recruited from a university setting. Subjects completed a demographic questionnaire prior to testing. Hold times for each position was measured in seconds. Subjects were able to hold many of the positions for a mean score of approximately 40 seconds. There were no side-to-side differences in test position hold times per gender. Males were able to hold some positions significantly longer than their female counterparts. Males with a lower BMI were able to hold 8 of the 10 positions significantly longer than those with a higher BMI. Bunkie test scores in subjects with a prior history of musculoskeletal injury were similar to those with no history of injury. The normative data presented in this study may be used by rehabilitation professionals when assessing and rehabilitating their patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The shoulder manual resistance test is one of the common clinical assessments for patients with muscle weakness. However, there have been no studies investigating the threshold for muscle weakness. The purpose of this study was to clarify the threshold for muscle weakness in the shoulder manual muscle resistance test. METHODS: Fifty-three patients (37.9~{\textpm}~20.6~years old) with either rotator cuff tear (21 patients), superior labrum anterior-to-posterior (SLAP) lesion (7 patients), or Bankart lesion (25 patients) of one shoulder were administered three manual muscle resistance tests (abduction strength, external rotation, and belly press tests). Positive results in these tests were defined as a subjective weakness in the involved shoulder compared to the opposite shoulder. Based on this result, the patients were divided into positive and negative groups. Another observer measured isometric strength using a hand-held dynamometer and calculated the side-to-side ratio. Comparing instrument measurement with manual measurement, the cut-off point, at which we can recognise that there is a side-to-side difference, was calculated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: The cases with less than 60\% of the muscle strength in the contralateral shoulder were judged as positive in all examinations, whereas among the cases with 60-90\% of muscle strength, there was a mixture of negative and positive determinations. The cut-off point was 78.9\% in the abduction strength test, 73.8\% in the external rotation test, and 84.0\% in the belly press test. CONCLUSION: The side-to-side difference could be manually detected, when muscle strength was less than 75-85\% of that on the contralateral side. This finding suggests that it is necessary to understand the limitation of these manual tests in the case of clinical examinations. Therefore, care must be taken for the shoulder manual muscle resistance test as muscle weakness cannot be fully detected by manual measurement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case-control study, Level IV.},
