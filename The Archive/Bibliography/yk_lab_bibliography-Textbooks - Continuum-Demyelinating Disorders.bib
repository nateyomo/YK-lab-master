  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article reviews the most common leukodystrophies and is focused on diagnosis, clinical features, and emerging therapeutic options.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               In the past decade, the recognition of leukodystrophies has exponentially increased, and now this class includes more than 30 distinct disorders. Classically recognized as progressive and fatal disorders affecting young children, it is now understood that leukodystrophies are associated with an increasing spectrum of neurologic trajectories and can affect all ages. Next-generation sequencing and newborn screening allow the opportunity for the recognition of presymptomatic and atypical cases. These new testing opportunities, in combination with growing numbers of natural history studies and clinical consensus guidelines, have helped improve diagnosis and clinical care. Additionally, a more granular understanding of disease outcomes informs clinical trial design and has led to several recent therapeutic advances. This review summarizes the current understanding of the clinical manifestations of disease and treatment options for the most common leukodystrophies.                                         SUMMARY               As early testing becomes more readily available through next-generation sequencing and newborn screening, neurologists will better understand the true incidence of the leukodystrophies and be able to diagnose children within the therapeutic window. As targeted therapies are developed, it becomes increasingly imperative that this broad spectrum of disorders is recognized and diagnosed. This work summarizes key advances in the leukodystrophy field.},

It discusses the importance of diagnosing and detecting progression early, the similarities between progressive forms, challenges in detecting progression, factors that could augment progression, and the importance of disease-modifying therapies in patients with evidence of active progressive MS. It also discusses the overall care of progressive MS.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               The pathogenesis of primary progressive MS and secondary progressive MS is overlapping, and in both presentations, patients with relapses or focal MRI activity are classified as having active, progressive MS. All currently approved disease-modifying therapies are indicated for active secondary progressive MS. The therapeutic opportunity of anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of progressive MS is enhanced in those who are younger and have a shorter disease duration. Vascular comorbidities may contribute to progression in MS.                                         SUMMARY               Several challenges remain in the diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment of progressive MS. Early identification of active progressive MS is needed to maximize treatment benefit. The advantages of optimal comorbidity management (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) in delaying progression are uncertain. Clinical care guidelines for advanced, severe MS are lacking.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Our understanding of neuroimmune disorders of the central nervous system is rapidly expanding. Several clinical and paraclinical factors help to inform the diagnosis and ultimately the suspicion for a monophasic versus relapsing course, including the age of the patient (prepubertal versus postpubertal), presence or absence of clinical encephalopathy, identification of serum autoantibodies (eg, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein [MOG] and aquaporin-4), presence of intrathecally unique oligoclonal bands, and location/extent of radiologic abnormalities. Collaborative international research efforts have facilitated understanding of the safety and efficacy of currently available immunotherapies in children with acquired demyelinating disorders, particularly multiple sclerosis.                                         SUMMARY               Although many of the demyelinating disorders presented in this article can affect children and adults across the age spectrum, the clinical and radiologic phenotypes, treatment considerations, and long-term prognoses are often distinct in children.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The discovery of the pathogenic aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG autoantibody and characterization of NMOSD as an autoimmune astrocytopathy have spearheaded the identification of key immunologic therapeutic targets in this disease, including but not limited to the complement system, the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, and B cells. Accordingly, four recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of three new NMOSD therapies, namely eculizumab, satralizumab, and inebilizumab.                                         SUMMARY               Currently, NMOSD poses both diagnostic and treatment challenges. It is debated whether individuals who are seropositive for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG belong within the neuromyelitis optica spectrum. This discussion is fueled by disparities in treatment responses between patients who are AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative, suggesting different immunopathologic mechanisms may govern these conditions. As our understanding regarding the immune pathophysiology of NMOSD expands, emerging biomarkers, including serum neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), may facilitate earlier relapse detection and inform long-term treatment decisions. Future research focal points should include strategies to optimize relapse management, restorative treatments that augment neurologic recovery, and practical solutions that promote equitable access to approved therapies for all patients with NMOSD.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The armamentarium of immunotherapies has grown rapidly, to encompass 19 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immunotherapies available in 2021, which are addressed in the review. The coronavirus pandemic that began in 2020 underscored existing concerns regarding vaccine efficacy in those treated with immune-suppressing immunotherapies, which are also addressed here.                                         SUMMARY               By choosing a treatment strategy before exploring the individual medications, patients and providers can focus their efforts on a subset of the therapeutic options. Although the mechanisms of action, routes of administration, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the described agents and classes differ, all are effective in reducing relapse frequency in multiple sclerosis (MS), with most also showing a reduction in the accumulation of neurologic disability. These powerful effects are improving the lives of people with MS. Pharmacovigilance is critical for the safe use of these immune-modulating and -suppressing agents, and vaccine efficacy may be reduced by those with immune-suppressing effects.},

MOG-associated disorders can easily be confused with other CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica, but they have a distinct clinical phenotype and prognosis.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Most patients with MOG-associated disorders exhibit optic neuritis, myelitis, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) alone, sequentially, or in combination; the disease may be either monophasic or relapsing. Recent case reports have continued to expand the clinical spectrum of disease, and increasingly larger cohort studies have helped clarify its pathophysiology and natural history.                                         SUMMARY               Anti--MOG-associated disorders comprise a substantial subset of patients previously thought to have other seronegative CNS diseases. Accurate diagnosis is important because the relapse patterns and prognosis for MOG-associated disorders are unique. Immunotherapy appears to successfully mitigate the disease, although not all agents are equally effective. The emerging large-scale data describing the clinical spectrum and natural history of MOG-associated disorders will be foundational for future therapeutic trials.},

Diagnostic criteria for MS have evolved over time, and the latest version facilitates earlier diagnosis of MS in those presenting with typical clinical syndromes. This article summarizes the current diagnostic criteria for MS, typical and atypical presentations of MS, and when diagnostic criteria should be applied with caution.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The most recent version of the MS diagnostic criteria has the benefits of simplicity and greater sensitivity in comparison to previous iterations. However, misdiagnosis remains a significant issue in MS clinical care, even at MS specialty centers. It is, therefore, evident that careful clinical application of the current version of the diagnostic criteria is necessary and that tools improving the diagnostic accuracy of MS would be of substantial clinical utility. Emerging diagnostic biomarkers that may be useful in this regard, including the central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and fluid biomarkers, are discussed.                                         SUMMARY               Current MS diagnostic criteria facilitate the early diagnosis of MS in people presenting with typical clinical syndromes but should be used cautiously in those presenting with atypical syndromes and in special populations. Clinical judgment and existing paraclinical tools, including sequential MRIs of the neuraxis and laboratory tests, are useful in minimizing misdiagnosis and facilitating the accurate diagnosis of MS. Diagnostic biomarkers that may facilitate or refute a diagnosis of MS in these settings, and emerging imaging and fluid biomarkers may eventually become available for use in clinical settings.},

A stepped approach starts with healthy lifestyle practices and adds nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and procedural-based therapies balancing levels of evidence, risks, and potential benefits. The growing availability of cannabis and widespread use of dietary supplements in self-management of MS symptoms raise both therapeutic promises and challenges.

RECENT FINDINGS               The prevalence of MS has increased in recent decades, and costs of care for patients with MS have risen dramatically. Black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals may be at risk for more severe MS-related disability. Multiple genetic MS risk factors have been identified. Factors such as low vitamin D levels and a history of Epstein-Barr virus, smoking, and obesity, especially during childhood, also influence MS risk. Traditionally thought to be a T-cell--mediated disease, recent research has highlighted the additional roles of B cells and microglia in both relapsing and progressive MS.                                         SUMMARY               Complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors affect the risk for MS as well as the disease course. People of color have historically been underrepresented in both MS clinical trials and literature, but current research is attempting to better clarify unique considerations in these groups. MS pathology consists of the focal inflammatory lesions that have been well characterized in relapsing MS, as well as a more widespread neurodegenerative component that is posited to drive progressive disease. Recent advances in characterization of both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative aspects of MS pathophysiology have yielded potential targets for future therapeutic options.},
