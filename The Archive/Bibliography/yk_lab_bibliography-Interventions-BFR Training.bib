  abstract = {Abstract                            Objectives               This systematic review evaluated the safety and efficacy of blood flow restriction exercise (BFRE) on skeletal muscle size, strength, and functional performance in individuals with neurological disorders (ND).                                         Methods               A literature search was performed in PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase. Two researchers independently assessed eligibility and performed data extraction and quality assessments. Eligibility criteria: Study populations with ND, BFRE as intervention modality, outcome measures related to safety or efficacy.                                         Results               Out of 443 studies identified, 16 were deemed eligible for review. Three studies examined the efficacy and safety of BFRE, one study focused on efficacy results, and 12 studies investigated safety. Disease populations included spinal cord injury (SCI), inclusion body myositis (sIBM), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. A moderate-to-high risk of bias was presented in the quality assessment. Five studies reported safety concerns, including acutely elevated pain and rating of perceived exertion levels, severe fatigue, muscle soreness, and cases of autonomic dysreflexia. Two RCTs reported a significant between-group difference in physical function outcomes, and two RCTs reported neuromuscular adaptations.                                         Conclusion               BFRE seems to be a potentially safe and effective training modality in individuals with ND. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously due to limited quality and number of studies, small sample sizes, and a general lack of heterogeneity within and between the examined patient cohorts.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of low-load blood flow restriction (BFR) training on shoulder muscle thickness, rotator cuff (RC) strength, and shoulder symptoms in patients with RC tendinopathy. DESIGN: A randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled trial. SETTINGS: Physiotherapy clinic at a university. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight patients were randomized into an 8-week (2 times/week) shoulder rehabilitation, that is, BFR or non-BFR group. INTERVENTIONS: BFR training. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) RC, deltoid, scapula retractor, and biceps muscle thicknesses and shoulder internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) strengths. (2) Shoulder pain/function. RESULTS: The BFR group had a greater increase in biceps muscle thickness ( P = 0.002) and shoulder IR strength at 60 degrees/s ( P = 0.040) than the non-BFR group. No differences between the 2 groups were observed in other measurements. Significant improvements in supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and scapula retractor muscle thicknesses and in shoulder ER and IR strengths were observed over time in both the groups (all P {$<$} 0 .05). Also, shoulder pain decreased and shoulder function increased over time in both the groups (all P {$<$} 0 .05). CONCLUSIONS: Low-load BFR training resulted in a greater increase in biceps thickness and shoulder IR strength compared with the non-BFR group in patients with RC tendinopathy. However, there was no superiority of either exercise training regarding the RC, scapula retractor, deltoid muscle thicknesses, or improvements in shoulder ER strength and shoulder pain/function. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME AND REGISTRATION NUMBER: The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov named Blood Flow Restriction Training in Patients with Shoulder Pain and the registration number is NCT04333784.},

  abstract = {[Purpose] There is little evidence for blood flow restriction (BFR), or Kaatsu, training in people with neurologic conditions. This study's purpose was to survey clinicians on BFR use in people with neurologic conditions. [Participants and Methods] One-hundred twelve physical therapists and other healthcare professionals who reported using BFR in the past 5\>years completed an anonymous, online survey. [Results] Eighty-nine percent of respondents thought BFR was safe in people with neurologic conditions. Meanwhile, 38\% reported BFR use in people with neurologic conditions. The most common intervention used with BFR was resistance training (n=33) and the most commonly reported benefit was improved strength (n=27). The most common side-effect causing treatment to stop was intolerance to pressure (n=6). No side-effects requiring medical attention were reported. In order to support future BFR use in neurologic populations, the most common response was the need for more research (n=63). [Conclusion] Despite the lack of evidence, clinical use of BFR in people with neurologic conditions may be somewhat common. Although this study had a relatively small sample size and collected data retrospectively, the results support the potential clinical feasibility and safety of BFR use in patients with neurologic conditions and suggest that more research is needed.},

  abstract = {Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a modality with growing interest in the last decade and has been recognized as a critical tool in rehabilitation medicine, athletic and clinical populations. Besides its potential for positive benefits, BFRT has the capability to induce adverse responses. BFRT may evoke increased blood pressure, abnormal cardiovascular responses and impact vascular health. Furthermore, some important concerns with the use of BFRT exists for individuals with established cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease patients). In addition, considering the potential risks of thrombosis promoted by BFRT in medically compromised populations, BFRT use warrants caution for patients that already display impaired blood coagulability, loss of antithrombotic mechanisms in the vessel wall, and stasis caused by immobility (e.g., COVID-19 patients, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, orthopedic post-surgery, anabolic steroid and ergogenic substance users, rheumatoid arthritis, and pregnant/postpartum women). To avoid untoward outcomes and ensure that BFRT is properly used, efficacy endpoints such as a questionnaire for risk stratification involving a review of the patient's medical history, signs, and symptoms indicative of underlying pathology is strongly advised. Here we present a model for BFRT pre-participation screening to theoretically reduce risk by excluding people with comorbidities or medically complex histories that could unnecessarily heighten intra- and/or post-exercise occurrence of adverse events. We propose this risk stratification tool as a framework to allow clinicians to use their knowledge, skills and expertise to assess and manage any risks related to the delivery of an appropriate BFRT exercise program. The questionnaires for risk stratification are adapted to guide clinicians for the referral, assessment, and suggestion of other modalities/approaches if/when necessary. Finally, the risk stratification might serve as a guideline for clinical protocols and future randomized controlled trial studies.},

  abstract = {There is scientific evidence that Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) is beneficial in healthy people, the elderly and patients with musculoskeletal disorders. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of BFR in patients with neurological disorders. The literature search was conducted up until July 2022 in the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), LILACS, Scopus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Literature Complete (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO). The PEDro scale was used to analyze the methodological quality of the studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool was employed to evaluate the risk of bias. A total of seven articles were included. BFR seems to be beneficial in neurological disorders. Improvements have been found in sensorimotor function, frequency and step length symmetry, perceived exertion, heart rate and gait speed, walking endurance, fatigue, quality of life, muscles thickness, gluteus density and muscle edema. No improvements were found in lower limb strength or balance. However, results must be taken with caution due to the small number of articles and to the large heterogeneity. More clinical trials are needed. These studies should homogenize the protocols used in larger samples, as well as improve their methodological quality.},
