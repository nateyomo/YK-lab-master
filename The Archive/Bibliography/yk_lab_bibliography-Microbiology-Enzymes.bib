  abstract = {Creatine phosphokinase (CPK), also known by the name creatine kinase (CK), is the enzyme that catalyzes~the reaction of creatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP).~This CPK enzyme reaction is reversible; thus, ATP can be generated from PCr and ADP. The phosphocreatine created from this reaction is used to supply tissues and cells that require substantial amounts of ATP, like the brain, skeletal muscles, and the heart, with their required ATP.~Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is a central controller of cellular energy homeostasis. Many conditions can cause derangement in CPK levels, including rhabdomyolysis, heart disease, kidney disease, or even certain medications.},

  abstract = {Found in all vertebrates, creatine kinase catalyzes the reversible reaction of creatine and ATP forming phosphocreatine and ADP. Phosphocreatine may be viewed as a reservoir of "high-energy phosphate" which is able to supply ATP, the primary energy source in bioenergetics, on demand. Consequently, creatine kinase plays a significant role in energy homeostasis of cells with intermittently high energy requirements. The enzyme is of clinical importance and its levels are routinely used as an indicator of myocardial and skeletal muscle disorders and for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. First identified in 1928, the enzyme has undergone intensive investigation for over 75 years. There are four major isozymes, two cytosolic and two mitochondrial, which form dimers and octamers, respectively. Depending on the pH, the enzyme operates by a random or an ordered bimolecular mechanism, with the equilibrium lying towards phosphocreatine production. Evidence suggests that conversion of creatine to phosphocreatine occurs via the in-line transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP. A recent X-ray structure of creatine kinase bound to a transition state analog complex confirmed many of the predictions based on kinetic, spectroscopic, and mutagenesis studies. This review summarizes and correlates the more significant mechanistic and structural studies on creatine kinase.},
