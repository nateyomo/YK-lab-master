  abstract = {In volleyball, the dominant shoulder of the athlete undergoes biomechanical and morphological adaptations; however, definitive conclusions about their exact nature, aetiology, purpose and associations with shoulder injury have not been reached. We present a systematic review of the existing literature describing biomechanical adaptations in the dominant shoulders of volleyball players and factors that may predispose to shoulder pain/injury. A thorough literature search via Medline, EMBASE and SCOPUS was conducted for original studies of volleyball players and 15 eligible articles were identified. Assessment of study quality was performed using the STROBE statement. The reviewed literature supports the existence of a glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) and a possible (and less pronounced) external rotation gain in the dominant vs. the non-dominant shoulder of volleyball athletes. Unlike other overhead sports, the GIRD in volleyball athletes appears to be anatomical as a response to the repetitive overhead movements and not to be associated with shoulder pain/injury. Additionally, the dominant shoulder exhibits muscular imbalance, which appears to be a significant risk factor for shoulder pain. Strengthening of the external rotators should be used alongside shoulder stretching and joint mobilisations, core strengthening and optimisation of spike technique as part of injury management and prevention programmes.},

  abstract = {Volleyball is a popular sport, but there~has been little research to date investigating the recovery process. Volleyball involves short bouts of high intensity exertion, often with limited time to rest between matches. This literature review highlights the specific methods used to recover after playing volleyball and evaluates their effectiveness. Recovery strategies have been shown to increase performance and prevent injury. Specific techniques identified include nutritional strategies, proper sleep, mental and psychological techniques, cold water immersion, and laser therapy. Some, such as nutrition and sleep, have been definitively shown to benefit volleyball players, while others, such as cold water immersion and laser therapy, have shown promise but require further research to determine their overall effect.~Other areas of future research include evaluating the effectiveness of combined recovery techniques as well as determining which are best for rapid recovery.},

  abstract = {Volleyball is a team sport with high physical and perceptual-cognitive demand, hence, increasing the perception of physical and mental fatigue during a competition. To alleviate fatigue (physical and mental), mindfulness and music have been proposed. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of mindfulness-based mental versus music training on mental fatigue, physical fatigue, and recovery in elite competitive female volleyball athletes using a randomized two-controlled study with follow-up. Participants were 30 elite female Brazilian volleyball athletes. Athletes were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) mindfulness-based mental training group (MBMT); 2) music-based training group (MBT); or 3) control group (CG). Three variables were evaluated as follows: 1) recovery based on total quality recovery; 2) mental fatigue visual analog scale; and 3) physical fatigue visual analog scale. Regarding recovery, there was no difference between the MBMT, MBT, and CG groups (p {$>$} 0.05). A difference in mental fatigue was noted between MBT and CG at follow-up [F(2,26) = 5.71, p = 0.009; large]. Regarding physical fatigue, there was no difference between the MBMT, MBT, and CG groups (p {$>$} 0.05). The mindfulness intervention effectively attenuated the mental fatigue caused by competition in volleyball athletes. These results will assist coaches and staff in providing fatigue management and reinforce the applicability of mental training in sports.},

Effect of cold water immersion performed on successive days on physical performance, muscle damage, and inflammatory, hormonal, and oxidative stress markers in volleyball players. J Strength Cond Res 33(2): 502-513, 2019-The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of daily cold water immersion (CWI) on physical performance, muscle damage, and inflammatory, hormonal, and oxidative stress markers in volleyball. Six players were submitted to CWI and six players to a placebo, during 5 training days. Thigh circumference, squat jump, and agility were measured on the first, third, and sixth days. On the first and sixth days, blood and saliva were collected for analysis of oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inflammatory and hormonal levels. Muscle soreness and countermovement jump were quantified daily. The physical performance comparisons did not present differences and the only between group comparison with a large effect size (ES = -1.39) was in {$\Delta\%$} between day 1 and day 2 for countermovement jump. Delayed onset muscle soreness and creatine kinase increased in both groups and the ESs of between group comparisons of {$\Delta\%$} between moments were not more than moderate. Thigh circumference increased only in the placebo group (p = 0.04) and the ES of the between group comparisons of {$\Delta\%$} between moments was large (1.53). No differences were found in oxidative stress, or inflammatory markers. Cortisol decreased only in the CWI-group (p {$\leq$} 0.05) and the ESs of the between group comparisons of {$\Delta\%$} between moments of the testosterone to cortisol ratio (-1.94) and insulin-like growth-1 (-1.34) were large. Despite the positive effects of daily CWI on muscle edema and hormonal status, the limited effects of CWI on performance, muscle damage, inflammation markers, and reactive oxygen species mediators signal the unimportance of the daily practice of this recovery method in volleyball players.},

  abstract = {In the last decades, indoor volleyball has experienced significant rule changes and a high player specialization in both sexes. Different spike attack arm swing techniques have developed which might affect performance and risk of injury. While a variety of arm swing techniques was already shown in world class beach volleyball players, it is unclear if this is also true for world class indoor volleyball. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the spike attack arm swing techniques of Olympic volleyball winners and finalists (1984-2021) and to investigate possible differences between sex, playing position, scoring system, and compared to beach volleyball. Eighty-two male (M) and 85 female (F) players were assessed from video recordings from ten competitions. Five different arm swing techniques in the cocking phase (Straight, Bow-and-arrow high, Bow-and-arrow low, Snap, Circular) were classified by two experts. The most frequent technique for both sexes was the Circular (M = 40.2\%; F = 38.8\%), followed by Snap (M = 28.0\%; F = 23.5\%), Bow-and-arrow low (M = 20.7\%; F = 21.2\%), Bow-and-arrow high (M = 7.3\% F = 11.8\%), and Straight (M = 3.7\%; F = 4.7\%). Bow-and-arrow high and Straight techniques were significantly less used than other techniques in both sexes. There were no significant differences (p \&gt; 0.05) in arm swing techniques between sexes, playing positions, and scoring system but significant differences (p \&lt; 0.001) to beach volleyball. Although most volleyball textbooks only describe the Bow-and-arrow techniques, most of the world class indoor volleyball players used Circular and Snap arm swing techniques. Reasons for that could be the implicit knowledge of players (and coaches) regarding increased performance (ball speed) and injury prevention. Based on these results we suggest to critically revise arm swing technique training especially for young players and players with shoulder problems.},
