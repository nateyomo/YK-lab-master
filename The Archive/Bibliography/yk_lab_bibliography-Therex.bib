  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maintaining neutral spinal alignment is considered important when performing the barbell back squat exercise. Since male and female lifters may differ in injury location it is important to examine whether they differ in spinal alignment during the back squat. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to quantify the spinal alignment in the upper and lower lumbar spine during the barbell back squat exercise in male and female lifters. Secondary aims were to compare alignment during the back squat to standing habitual lumbar spine alignment and determine whether male and female lifters differ in these aspects. STUDY DESIGN: Observational, Cross-sectional. METHODS: Competitive power- and weightlifters were recruited and performed three repetitions of the barbell back squat exercise using a load equivalent to 70\% of their one-repetition maximum. Spinal alignment and range of motion were measured using inertial measurement units placed on the thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine. Data was presented descriptively and comparisons between men and women as well as spinal alignment in four different positions were done with a factorial repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Twenty-three (14 males, 9 females) were included. During execution of the squat, spinal alignment adjustments in the lumbar spine were made in all three planes of movement, compared to the start position, in both male and female lifters. Compared to their standing habitual posture, all lifters adjusted their upper lumbar spine to a less lordotic position when in the start position of the back squat (standing upright with the barbell on their back). Only male lifters assumed a less lordotic alignment in their lower lumbar spine in the start position compared their habitual posture. CONCLUSIONS: Adjustments of spinal alignment, predominantly in the sagittal plane, are made during execution of the back squat in both male and female lifters. Further, lifters adopt a less lordotic alignment with a heavy barbell on their upper back, more so in male than female lifters. In conclusion, it seems that spinal alignment changes noticeably during the barbell back squat. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3{\copyright}The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The present study investigated the activation of gluteal, thigh, and lower back muscles in different squat variations. Ten male competitive bodybuilders perform back-squat at full (full-BS) or parallel (parallel-BS) depth, using large feet-stance (sumo-BS), and enhancing the feet external rotation (external-rotated-sumo-BS) and front-squat (FS) at 80\% 1-RM. The normalized surface electromyographic root-mean-square (sEMG RMS) amplitude of gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, adductor longus, longissimus, and iliocostalis was recorded during both the ascending and descending phase of each exercise. During the descending phase, greater sEMG RMS amplitude of gluteus maximus and gluteus medius was found in FS vs. all other exercises (p {$<$} 0.05). Additionally, FS elicited iliocostalis more than all other exercises. During the ascending phase, both sumo-BS and external-rotated-sumo-BS showed greater vastus lateralis and adductor longus activation compared to all other exercises (p {$<$} 0.05). Moreover, rectus femoris activation was greater in FS compared to full-BS (p {$<$} 0.05). No between-exercise difference was found in vastus medialis and longissimus showed no between-exercise difference. FS needs more backward stabilization during the descending phase. Larger feet-stance increases thigh muscles activity, possibly because of their longer length. These findings show how bodybuilders uniquely recruit muscles when performing different squat variations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine how distinct combinations of resistance training prescription (RTx) variables (load, sets and frequency) affect muscle strength and hypertrophy. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched until February 2022. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised trials that included healthy adults, compared at least 2 predefined conditions (non-exercise control (CTRL) and 12 RTx, differentiated by load, sets and/or weekly frequency), and reported muscle strength and/or hypertrophy were included. ANALYSES: Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis methodology was used to compare RTxs and CTRL. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve values were used to rank conditions. Confidence was assessed with threshold analysis. RESULTS: The strength network included 178 studies (n=5097; women=45\%). The hypertrophy network included 119 studies (n=3364; women=47\%). All RTxs were superior to CTRL for muscle strength and hypertrophy. Higher-load ({$>$}80\% of single repetition maximum) prescriptions maximised strength gains, and all prescriptions comparably promoted muscle hypertrophy. While the calculated effects of many prescriptions were similar, higher-load, multiset, thrice-weekly training (standardised mean difference (95\% credible interval); 1.60 (1.38 to 1.82) vs CTRL) was the highest-ranked RTx for strength, and higher-load, multiset, twice-weekly training (0.66 (0.47 to 0.85) vs CTRL) was the highest-ranked RTx for hypertrophy. Threshold analysis demonstrated these results were extremely robust. CONCLUSION: All RTx promoted strength and hypertrophy compared with no exercise. The highest-ranked prescriptions for strength involved higher loads, whereas the highest-ranked prescriptions for hypertrophy included multiple sets.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the accuracy of visual assessments made by physical therapists of lumbo-pelvic movements during the squat and deadlift and how much movement is considered injurious. DESIGN: Quantitative Cross-sectional. PARTICIPANTS: 14 powerlifters, 10 Olympic weightlifters and six physical therapists. SETTING: The lifters were recorded simultaneously by video and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) system while performing squats and deadlifts. The physical therapists assessed the videos and rated whether specific lumbo-pelvic movements were visible during the lifts and whether the movement amplitude was considered injurious. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The nominal visual assessments, if there was a movement and if it was considered injurious, were compared to the degrees of movement attained from the IMU system. RESULTS: During the squat, a posterior pelvic tilt of {$\geq$}34{$^\circ$} was required to visually detect the movement. For other lumbo-pelvic movements, there was no significant difference in the amount of movement between those who were assessed as moving or not moving their lumbo-pelvic area, nor was there a difference in movement amplitude between those who were assessed as having an increased risk of injury or not. CONCLUSIONS: Physical therapists did not consistently detect lumbo-pelvic movements during squats and deadlifts when performed by competitive lifters.},

DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials, Scielo, and CINAHL (from the earliest date available to November 2014) for randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy of stabilization exercises compared to general exercises or manual therapy on pain, disability, and function in patients with low back pain. Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria (413 stabilization exercises patients, 297 general exercises patients, and 185 manual therapy patients). Stabilization exercises may provide greater benefit than general exercise for pain reduction and improvement in disability. Stabilization exercise improved pain with a WMD of~-1.03 (95\% CI:~-1.29 to~-0.27) and improved disability with a WMD of~-5.41 (95\% CI:~-8.34 to~-2.49). There were no significant differences in pain and disability scores among participants in the stabilization exercise group compared to those in the manual therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Stabilization exercises were as efficacious as manual therapy in decreasing pain and disability and should be encouraged as part of musculoskeletal rehabilitation for low back pain.},

  abstract = {[Purpose] This study aimed to examine the effects of pelvic movements on the back function of patients with lumbar disc herniation when lumbar stabilization exercise was applied to the patients, suggest an intervention method that can be used in future clinical therapies. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty patients with lumbar disc herniation underwent the intervention 30 minutes per day, three times per week for 4 weeks. Of them, 15 patients were assigned to the balance center stabilization resistance exercise group (experimental group I) and the other 15 were assigned to the three-dimensional stabilization exercise group (experimental group II). Before the intervention, disc herniation index was measured using magnetic resonance imaging, sacral angle was measured using X-ray, and back function was measured using the KODI. Four weeks later, these three factors were re-measured and analyzed. [Results] There was a significant pre- versus post-intervention difference in disc herniation index, sacral angle, and KODI in experimental group I and a significant difference in disc herniation index and KODI in experimental group II, and each group of disc herniation index and sacral angle had a significant difference. In experimental group I, each disc herniation index and sacral angle had a negative correlation. [Conclusion] The lumbar stabilization exercise, which controls balance using pelvic movements, improves mobility and stability of the sacroiliac joint; therefore, it increases pelvic and back movements. These kinds of movements not only improved proprioception sense, they also had positive effects on lumbar disc function recovery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inspite of common lifting advice to maintain a lordotic posture, there is debate regarding optimal lumbar spine posture during lifting. To date, the influence of lumbar posture on trunk muscle recruitment, strength and efficiency during high intensity lifting has not been fully explored. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do differences in lumbar posture influence trunk extensor strength (moment), trunk muscle activity, and neuromuscular efficiency during maximal lifting? METHODS: Twenty-six healthy participants adopted three lumbar postures (maximal extension (lordotic), mid-range (flat-back), and fully flexed) in a free lifting position. Motion analysis and force measurements were used to determine the back extensor, hip and knee moments. Surface electromyography (EMG) of three trunk extensors and the internal obliques were recorded. Neuromuscular efficiency (NME) was expressed as a ratio of normalised extensor moment to normalised EMG. RESULTS: Significantly higher back extensor moments were exerted when moving from an extended to mid-range, and from a mid-range to fully flexed lumbar posture. This was accompanied by a decrease in activity across all three back extensor muscles (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) resulting in a higher NME of these muscles in more flexed postures. Change in lumbar posture did not influence hip or knee moments or internal oblique activation. SIGNIFICANCE: A flexed-back posture is associated with increased strength and efficiency of the back muscles compared to a lordotic posture. These findings further question the manual handling advice to lift with a lordotic lumbar spine.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether lumbar spine flexion during lifting is a risk factor for low back pain (LBP) onset/persistence or a differentiator of people with and without LBP. DESIGN: Etiology systematic review with meta-analysis. LITERATURE SEARCH: Database search of ProQuest, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase up to August 21, 2018. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: We included peer-reviewed articles that investigated whether lumbar spine position during lifting was a risk factor for LBP onset or persistence or a differentiator of people with and without LBP. DATA SYNTHESIS: Lifting-task comparison data were tabulated and summarized. The meta-analysis calculated an n-weighted pooled mean {\textpm} SD of the results in the LBP and no-LBP groups. If a study contained multiple comparisons (ie, different lifting tasks that used various weights or directions), then only 1 result from that study was included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Four studies (1 longitudinal study and 3 cross-sectional studies across 5 articles) included in meta-analysis measured lumbar flexion with intralumbar angles and found no difference in peak lumbar spine flexion when lifting (1.5{$^\circ$}; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: -0.7{$^\circ$}, 3.7{$^\circ$}; P = .19 for the longitudinal study and -0.9{$^\circ$}; 95\% CI: -2.5{$^\circ$}, 0.7{$^\circ$}; P = .29 for the cross-sectional studies). Seven cross-sectional studies measured lumbar flexion with thoracopelvic angles and found that people with LBP lifted with 6.0{$^\circ$} less lumbar flexion than people without LBP (95\% CI: -11.2{$^\circ$}, -0.9{$^\circ$}; P = .02). Most (9/11) studies reported no significant between-group differences in lumbar flexion during lifting. The included studies were of low quality. CONCLUSION: There was low-quality evidence that greater lumbar spine flexion during lifting was not a risk factor for LBP onset/persistence or a differentiator of people with and without LBP.
