  abstract = {Caffeine is a commonly used neurostimulant that also produces cerebral vasoconstriction by antagonizing adenosine receptors. Chronic caffeine use results in an adaptation of the vascular adenosine receptor system presumably to compensate for the vasoconstrictive effects of caffeine. We investigated the effects of caffeine on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in increasing levels of chronic caffeine use. Low (mean = 45 mg/day), moderate (mean = 405 mg/day), and high (mean = 950 mg/day) caffeine users underwent quantitative perfusion magnetic resonance imaging on four separate occasions: twice in a caffeine abstinent state (abstained state) and twice in a caffeinated state following their normal caffeine use (native state). In each state, there were two drug conditions: participants received either caffeine (250 mg) or placebo. Gray matter CBF was tested with repeated-measures analysis of variance using caffeine use as a between-subjects factor, and correlational analyses were conducted between CBF and caffeine use. Caffeine reduced CBF by an average of 27\% across both caffeine states. In the abstained placebo condition, moderate and high users had similarly greater CBF than low users; but in the native placebo condition, the high users had a trend towards less CBF than the low and moderate users. Our results suggest a limited ability of the cerebrovascular adenosine system to compensate for high amounts of daily caffeine use.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Occipital neuralgia (ON) and cervicogenic headache (CGH) are secondary headache disorders with occipital pain as a key feature. Due to significant phenotypic overlap, differentiating ON and CGH from primary headache disorders such as migraine or tension-type headache, or other secondary headache disorders, can be clinically challenging. This article reviews the anatomy, clinical features, unique diagnostic considerations, and management approaches relating to ON and CGH. RECENT FINDINGS: Conservative therapeutic approaches are considered first-line. Anesthetic nerve blocks may have a dual role in both supporting diagnosis and providing pain relief. Newer minimally invasive procedures, such as pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) and occipital nerve stimulation (ONS), represent an exciting therapeutic avenue for severe/refractory cases. Surgical interventions should be reserved for select patient populations who have failed all other conservative and minimally invasive options, to be weighed against potential risk. ON and CGH represent an ongoing diagnostic challenge. Further studies are required to consolidate efficacy regarding the comprehensive management of ON and CGH.},

  abstract = {Cervicogenic headache is characterised by pain referred to the head from the cervical spine. Although the International Headache Society recognises this type of headache as a distinct disorder, some clinicians remain sceptical. Laboratory and clinical studies have shown that pain from upper cervical joints and muscles can be referred to the head. Clinical diagnostic criteria have not proved valid, but a cervical source of pain can be established by use of fluoroscopically guided, controlled, diagnostic nerve blocks. In this Review, we outline the basic science and clinical evidence for cervicogenic headache and indicate how opposing approaches to its definition and diagnosis affect the evidence for its clinical management. We provide recommendations that enable a pragmatic approach to the diagnosis and management of probable cervicogenic headache, as well as a rigorous approach to the diagnosis and management of definite cervical headache.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides a systematic diagnostic approach to the patient with headache. RECENT FINDINGS: The vast majority of patients presenting with headache in clinical practice have a primary headache disorder. The most common primary headache disorder in clinical practice is overwhelmingly migraine. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients with migraine do not receive an accurate diagnosis. In addition, the clinical features of migraine overlap with secondary causes of headache, making a careful history and deliberative evaluation for warning symptoms or signs of a secondary headache disorder of paramount importance. SUMMARY: The approach to the patient with headache requires knowledge of the diagnostic criteria for primary headache disorders, recognition of the importance of a systematic evaluation for red flags associated with secondary headache disorders, and awareness of the pearls and pitfalls encountered in the diagnostic evaluation of a patient with headache.},

Many of the older oral preventatives were trialed before chronic migraine was defined, and they are used in chronic migraine based on the assumption that episodic migraine and chronic migraine are on a spectrum of the same condition. First- and second-line options are given, and a multicountry perspective is considered.},

The unclear pathogenesis of primary headache disorders has led to high rates of misdiagnosis and limited available treatment options. In this review, we have summarized the pathophysiological factors for a better understanding of primary headache disorders. Advances in functional neuroimaging, genetics, neurophysiology have indicated that cortical hyperexcitability, regional brain dysfunction, central sensitization and neuroplasticity changes play vital roles in the development of primary headache disorders. Moreover, we have also discussed a series of neurostimulation approaches with their stimulation mechanism, safety and efficacy for prevention and treatment of primary headache disorders. Noninvasive or implantable neurostimulation techniques show great promise for treating refractory primary headache disorders.},
