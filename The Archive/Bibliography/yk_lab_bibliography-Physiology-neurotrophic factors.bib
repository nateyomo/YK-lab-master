  abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most widely distributed and extensively studied neurotrophins in the mammalian brain. Among its prominent functions, one can mention control of neuronal and glial development, neuroprotection, and modulation of both short- and long-lasting synaptic interactions, which are critical for cognition and memory. A wide spectrum of processes are controlled by BDNF, and the sometimes contradictory effects of its action can be explained based on its specific pattern of synthesis, comprising several intermediate biologically active isoforms that bind to different types of receptor, triggering several signaling pathways. The functions of BDNF must be discussed in close relation to the stage of brain development, the different cellular components of nervous tissue, as well as the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction activated under physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we briefly summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of BDNF on regulation of neurophysiological processes. The importance of BDNF for future studies aimed at disclosing mechanisms of activation of signaling pathways, neuro- and gliogenesis, as well as synaptic plasticity is highlighted.},
