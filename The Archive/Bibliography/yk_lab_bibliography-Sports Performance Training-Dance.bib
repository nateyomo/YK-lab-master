  abstract = {Hip and groin injuries are common in ballet dancers, who often begin sport-specific training at a young age. The unique demands of ballet include extreme range of motion, with an emphasis on external rotation and abduction. This creates a distinctive constellation of hip symptoms and pathology in this cohort, which may differ from other flexibility sports. When managing hip symptoms in this cohort, orthopaedic surgeons should consider the unique factors associated with ballet, including ballet-specific movements, morphologic adaptations of the hip, and the culture of the sport. Three common etiologies of hip pain in ballet dancers include femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, hip instability, and extra-articular snapping hip syndrome. First-line treatment often consists of focused physical therapy to strengthen the core and periarticular hip musculature, with surgical management reserved for patients who fail to improve with conservative measures.},

  abstract = {Ballet dancers may be predisposed to hip injuries because of the unique demands placed on the hips during dance training and performance. Hip arthroscopy can be used to address several of these symptomatic disorders, including hip instability and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS). After hip arthroscopy, ballet dancers undergo a rehabilitation program to allow for healing, range of motion restoration, and progressive strengthening. Once patients complete the standard postoperative therapy program, a paucity of information is available to guide dancers back to the advanced hip movements involved in ballet. Therefore, the purpose of this clinical commentary is to present a stepwise rehabilitation protocol with return to ballet progression for dancers undergoing hip arthroscopy for instability or FAIS. Particular emphasis is placed on movement-specific exercises for ballet performers, and objective clinical metrics, to guide return to dance progression.},
