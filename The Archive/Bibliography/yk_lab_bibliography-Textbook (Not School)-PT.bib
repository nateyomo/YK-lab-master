Clear, illustrated instructions provide a guide to patient positioning, direction of motion, and direction of resistance. In addition to muscle testing of normal individuals and others with weakness or paralysis, this edition includes coverage of alternative strength tests and performance tests for older adults and others with functional decline (such as the inactive and obese). The tenth edition also includes coverage of muscle dynamometry and a sampling of ideal exercises. Updated by educators Dale Avers and Marybeth Brown, this classic physical therapy reference once again features a companion website with many new video clips demonstrating the latest muscle testing procedures and alternatives to muscle testing. In addition, two online only chapters - Cranial Nerve and Ready Reference Anatomy - have been added."--Publisher's description},

Griech and an impressive group of expert contributors was developed with that goal in mind. Twenty medically complex case studies, each with three standalone cases covering three distinct clinical settings, are presented to show medical and physical therapy management throughout the continuum of care. These high-quality case studies cover all the body systems and detail conditions including chronic, neurological, oncologic, and traumatic, which closely mirror cases seen in clinical practice. Each case study includes extensive medical data from an interprofessional team, imaging/diagnostic tests, social history, and physical therapy information. The text promotes interprofessional education by requiring learners to consider elements beyond the physical therapy plan of care"--},
