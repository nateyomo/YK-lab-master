  abstract = {Heel pain is a very common foot disease. Varieties of names such as plantar fasciitis, jogger's heel, tennis heal, policeman's heel are used to describe it. Mechanical factors are the most common etiology of heel pain. Common causes of hell pain includes: Plantar Fasciitis, Heel Spur, Sever's Disease, Heel bump, Achilles Tendinopathy, Heel neuritis, Heel bursitis. The diagnosis is mostly based on clinical examination. Normally, the location of the pain and the absence of associated symptoms indicating a systemic disease strongly suggest the diagnosis. Several therapies exist including rest, physical therapy, stretching, and change in footwear, arch supports, orthotics, night splints, anti-inflammatory agents, and surgery. Almost all patients respond to conservative nonsurgical therapy. Surgery is the last treatment option if all other treatments had failed. Rest, ice, massage, the use of correct exercise and complying with a doctor's advice all play important part in helping to recover from this hell pain condition, but getting good quality, suitable shoes with the appropriate amount of support for the whole foot is the most important.},

  abstract = {Morton's neuroma is a common pathology affecting the forefoot. It is not a true neuroma but is fibrosis of the nerve. This is caused secondary to pressure or repetitive irritation leading to thickness of the digital nerve, located in the third or second intermetatarsal space. The treatment options are: orthotics, steroid injections and surgical excision usually performed through dorsal approach. Careful clinical examination, patient selection, pre-operative counselling and surgical technique are the key to success in the management of this condition.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Cuboid syndrome is thought to be a common source of lateral midfoot pain in athletes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A Medline search was performed via PubMed (through June 2010) using the search terms cuboid, syndrome, subluxed, locked, fault, dropped, peroneal, lateral, plantar, and neuritis with the Boolean term AND in all possible combinations. Retrieved articles were hand searched for additional relevant references. RESULTS: Cuboid syndrome is thought to arise from subtle disruption of the arthrokinematics or structural congruity of the calcaneocuboid joint, although the precise pathomechanic mechanism has not been elucidated. Fibroadipose synovial folds (or labra) within the calcaneocuboid joint may play a role in the cause of cuboid syndrome, but this is highly speculative. The symptoms of cuboid syndrome resemble those of a ligament sprain. Currently, there are no definitive diagnostic tests for this condition. Case reports suggest that cuboid syndrome often responds favorably to manipulation and/or external support. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based guidelines regarding cuboid syndrome are lacking. Consequently, the diagnosis of cuboid syndrome is often based on a constellation of signs and symptoms and a high index of suspicion. Unless contraindicated, manipulation of the cuboid should be considered as an initial treatment.},
