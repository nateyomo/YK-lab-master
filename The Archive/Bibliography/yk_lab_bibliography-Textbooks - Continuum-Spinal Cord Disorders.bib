RECENT FINDINGS               Neuroimaging improvements and availability have uncovered many structural abnormalities in the spines and spinal cords of patients who were asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. Recent published clinical series have improved our knowledge of the natural history of structural abnormalities and the risks of intervention versus conservative management.                                         SUMMARY               Myelopathy from a suspected structural cause is a common reason for neurologic consultation. Correlation between the history, examination, and imaging are especially important to determine whether intervention is necessary or conservative management is the best option.},

This article reviews the anatomy of the spinal cord and discusses how the clinical findings, time course, and radiographic patterns can help to identify the causes of myelopathy.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Imaging observations such as MRI ``pancake'' gadolinium enhancement pattern with spondylotic myelopathy and subpial enhancement with neurosarcoidosis have improved diagnostic specificity. On the other hand, common diseases such as degenerative spine disease are now recognized as presenting much more variably. Improved imaging and the identification of genetic markers enhance the specificity of diagnosis. The improved identification of biomarkers has shown that the same cause, such as compressive myelopathy, can present more variably than previously appreciated.                                         SUMMARY               Spinal cord dysfunction, or myelopathy, remains a clinical diagnosis, and determining the cause requires integration of clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters, none of which have great specificity individually. Most cases of myelopathy will require further neuroimaging, and some require CSF analysis for diagnosis. This article presents an approach to the diagnosis of myelopathy based on excluding compressive myelopathy initially and then differentiating between acute and subacute processes and chronic causes.},

An anatomic approach is used; diseases of the extradural, intradural-extramedullary, and intramedullary (parenchymal) compartments are considered, and both neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions are covered. Differentiating imaging features are highlighted.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although T2-hyperintense signal abnormality of the spinal cord can have myriad etiologies, neuroimaging can provide specific diagnoses or considerably narrow the differential diagnosis in many cases. Intradural-extramedullary lesions compressing the spinal cord have a limited differential diagnosis and are usually benign; meningiomas and schwannomas are most common. Extradural lesions can often be specifically diagnosed. Disk herniations are the most commonly encountered mass of the epidural space. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy can cause a characteristic pattern of enhancement, which may be mistaken for an intrinsic myelopathy. A do-not-miss diagnosis of the extradural compartment is idiopathic spinal cord herniation, the appearance of which can overlap with arachnoid cysts and webs. Regarding intrinsic causes of myelopathy, the lesions of multiple sclerosis are characteristically short segment but can be confluent when multiple. Postcontrast MRI can be particularly helpful, including when attempting to differentiate the long-segment myelopathy of neurosarcoidosis and aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG--seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and when characterizing spinal cord tumors such as primary neoplasms and metastases. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula is another do-not-miss diagnosis, with characteristic MRI features both precontrast and postcontrast. Tract-specific white matter involvement can be a clue for diseases such as subacute combined degeneration, paraneoplastic myelopathy, and radiation myelitis, whereas gray matter--specific involvement can suggest conditions such as cord infarct, viral myelitis, or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG associated disorder.                                         SUMMARY               Knowledge of the neuroimaging findings of the many causes of spinal cord and cauda equina dysfunction is critical for both neurologists and neuroradiologists. A structured approach to lesion compartmental location and imaging feature characterization is recommended.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Rather than a disease, a disease process, or relating to specific cellular vulnerability, the term                 hereditary myelopathy                 refers to diverse inherited disorders in which major aspects of the clinical syndrome reflect disturbance of elements within the spinal cord (specifically, the dorsal columns and dorsal root ganglia, corticospinal tracts, and anterior horn cells). It is important to note that the clinical features of almost all hereditary myelopathies reflect not only disturbance of elements within the spinal cord but also disturbance of extraspinal structures (particularly, but not limited to, peripheral nerves and the cerebellum) and that these extraspinal clinical features can be very helpful in recognizing specific myelopathy syndromes. The value of classifying disorders as inherited myelopathies lies primarily in facilitating their clinical recognition and differential diagnosis. It is useful to recognize that many hereditary myelopathies conform to one of four clinical paradigms: (1) spinocerebellar ataxia, (2) motor neuron disorder, (3) leukodystrophy, or (4) distal motor-sensory axonopathy predominantly affecting the central nervous system. Although they are myelopathies, spinal dysraphisms such as spina bifida and myelomeningocele are not included in this context because they are not usually due to single-gene mutation and have low hereditability.

This article reviews cauda equina anatomy, the diagnostic approach to disorders of the cauda equina, features of cauda equina syndrome, and diskogenic and nondiskogenic disorders of the cauda equina.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Establishing clinical criteria for cauda equina syndrome has been a focus of a number of reviews, although the clinician must maintain a low threshold for emergent imaging in cases of suspected cauda equina syndrome because of the suboptimal reliability of various signs and symptoms in identifying this condition clinically. The timing of surgical intervention for compressive causes of cauda equina dysfunction remains a point of contention, although urgent decompression remains standard practice. A recent review that focused on outcomes in patients with cauda equina compression who underwent surgical decompression identified significant residual deficits in patients despite appropriate and timely intervention. Autoimmune conditions targeting the cauda equina have been increasingly recognized, including chronic immune sensory polyradiculopathy and chronic immune sensorimotor polyradiculopathy.

RECENT FINDINGS                                Some microorganisms exhibit neurotropism for the spinal cord (eg, enteroviruses such as poliovirus and flaviviruses such as West Nile virus), while others are more protean in neurologic manifestations (eg, herpesviruses such as varicella-zoster virus), and others are only rarely reported to cause myelopathy (eg, certain fungal and parasitic infections). Individuals who are immunocompromised are at increased risk of disseminated infection to the central nervous system. Within the last few years, an enterovirus D68 outbreak has been associated with cases of acute flaccid paralysis in children, and emerging Zika virus infection has been concurrent with cases of acute flaccid paralysis due to Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, although cases of myelitis have also been reported. Associated pathogens differ by geographic distribution, with myelopathies related to                 Borrelia burgdorferi                 (Lyme disease) and West Nile virus more commonly seen in the United States and parasitic infections encountered more often in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.

RECENT FINDINGS               The principles underlying spinal cord lesion localization are well established, but improvements in MRI and the discovery of pathologic antibodies associated with causes of transverse myelitis distinct from multiple sclerosis, such as aquaporin-4 IgG and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein IgG, have assisted in diagnosis.                                         SUMMARY               The spinal cord has a highly organized neuroanatomy of ascending and descending tracts that convey sensory, motor, and autonomic information. Using integration of clues from the patient's history and neurologic examination, the effective clinician can distinguish spinal cord from peripheral nerve or brain pathology, often determine the level and parts of the spinal cord affected by a lesion, and focus on a likely diagnosis.

This article reviews various types of inherited myelopathies, with emphasis on hereditary spastic paraplegias and spastic ataxias.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The ever-growing number of myelopathy-causing genes and broadening of phenotype-genotype correlations makes the molecular diagnosis of inherited myelopathies a daunting task. This article emphasizes the main phenotypic clusters among inherited myelopathies that can facilitate the diagnostic process. This article focuses on newly identified genetic causes and the most important identifying clinical features that can aid the diagnosis, including the presence of a characteristic age of onset and additional neurologic signs such as leukodystrophy, thin corpus callosum, or amyotrophy.                                         SUMMARY               The exclusion of potentially treatable causes of myelopathy remains the most important diagnostic step.

RECENT FINDINGS               The imaging characterization of immune-mediated myelopathies and the discovery of neural autoantibodies have been crucial in improving our ability to accurately diagnose myelitis. The identification of autoantibodies directed against specific central nervous system targets has led to major improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying inflammation in myelitis. It has also allowed distinction of these myelopathy etiologies from noninflammatory etiologies of myelopathy and from multiple sclerosis and provided insight into their risk of recurrence, treatment response, and long-term clinical outcomes. Prompt recognition and appropriate testing in the setting of acute and subacute myelopathies is critical as timely administration of immunotherapy can help improve symptoms and prevent permanent neurologic disability.

RECENT FINDINGS               Immobilization of the spine and spine clearance should be individualized depending on the ability to perform a reliable neurologic examination, the presence of neck pain, and the imaging findings. Early surgery (within 24 hours) to achieve definitive cord decompression and spine stabilization may be beneficial. Ensuring adequate oxygenation and perfusion and avoiding secondary systemic complications remain the goals of the critical care of these patients. No neuroprotective treatment has been shown to improve outcomes. In fact, the use of high-dose methylprednisolone is now generally discouraged because of its major systemic adverse effects. Survivors of severe cervical traumatic spinal cord injury typically sustain substantial long-term functional impairment. Advances in our understanding of neuroregenerative strategies, especially stem cell transplantation, can offer the future hope of functional improvement to the many patients currently living with the consequences of traumatic spinal cord injury. Yet, at present, these therapies remain strictly investigational.                                         SUMMARY               The treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury remains supportive, and prognosis is still poor for patients who are severely affected. While much remains to be learned about how to optimize the acute management of these patients, future efforts would be most useful if focused on injury prevention and the development of effective neuroregenerative therapies.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Myelopathy and myeloneuropathy due to vitamin B                 12                 deficiency is increasing in prevalence partly because of an aging population. Early recognition of the clinical symptoms and rapid initiation of treatment is essential. Copper deficiency is now also recognized as causing a similar clinical picture as vitamin B                 12                 deficiency. Conditions leading to copper deficiency include bariatric surgery and excessive zinc intake. Unusual conditions such as lathyrism and konzo are relevant to all neurologists because of emigration from less well-developed countries. Myelopathy can also occur from substance abuse (eg, heroin and nitrous oxide), and early diagnosis could lead to improved patient outcomes. The spinal cord may also be injured in decompression illness that occurs in sport divers and individuals who work in pressurized atmospheres.

RECENT FINDINGS               The exact pathophysiologic basis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy remains somewhat elusive. Diffusion-tensor imaging has emerged as a useful imaging modality that correlates more closely with clinical severity than standard MRI. Baseline disease severity, symptom duration, age, presence of impaired gait, and smoking status are significant factors related to surgical outcomes.

RECENT FINDINGS               The discovery of several neural autoantibodies and their antigenic targets has revolutionized the investigation and treatment of immune-mediated myelopathies. Detection of these serologic biomarkers can support or establish a diagnosis of an autoimmune myelopathy, and, in the case of paraneoplastic syndromes, indicate the likely presence of an underlying malignancy. Distinctive lesion patterns detected on spinal cord or brain MRI narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with acute or subacute inflammatory myelopathies, including those not associated with autoantibody markers.                                         SUMMARY               Immune-mediated myelopathies usually present acutely or subacutely and have a broad differential diagnosis. A systematic diagnostic approach using data from the clinical setting and presentation, MRI lesion patterns, CSF data, and autoantibody markers can differentiate these disorders from noninflammatory myelopathies, often with precise disease classification. This, in turn, provides prognostic information, especially whether the disorder is likely to relapse, and facilitates therapeutic decision making. Diagnostic accuracy informs selection of acute immunotherapy aimed at arresting and reversing recent neurologic injury and, when necessary, selection of long-term treatment for prevention of disease progression or relapse.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Neoplastic myelopathies are uncommon neurologic disorders but cause significant morbidity when they occur. Primary spinal cord tumors can be classified into intramedullary, intradural extramedullary, or extradural tumors. Diffuse gliomas and ependymal tumors are the most common intramedullary tumors. Diffuse gliomas include the World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III astrocytomas, the grade II and grade III oligodendrogliomas, the grade IV glioblastomas, and newly recognized pediatric diffuse midline gliomas with H3 K27M mutation. The majority of diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas are                 IDH                 -mutant tumors, whereas only 10\% of glioblastomas are                 IDH                 -mutant. Oligodendrogliomas are typically                 IDH                 -mutant and are characterized by the molecular signature of 1p/19q codeletion. Nine distinct molecular subgroups of ependymomas have been identified based on their genetic features and location.                 NF2                 mutations are frequently found in spinal cord ependymomas. Metastatic tumors are the most common tumors of the spine and can be extradural, leptomeningeal, or, rarely, intramedullary. Extradural metastatic spinal cord compression is a neurologic emergency and should be promptly diagnosed as pretreatment neurologic status dictates the posttreatment outcome.                                                        SUMMARY               Neoplastic myelopathies encompass many diagnoses ranging from benign and malignant spinal tumors to paraneoplastic syndromes heralding cancers. The knowledge of the clinical features and management of neoplastic myelopathies is essential to practicing neurologists as early diagnosis and treatment can prevent devastating neurologic sequelae.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although certain clinical features suggest a vascular etiology in acute and chronic myelopathy settings, accurate MRI interpretation within the clinical context is key. Recent studies have shown vascular myelopathies are frequently misdiagnosed as transverse myelitis, and recognition of this diagnostic pitfall is important. Many different vascular mechanisms can cause myelopathy; this article provides a comprehensive review that simplifies disease categories into arterial ischemia, venous congestion/ischemia, hematomyelia, and extraparenchymal hemorrhage.
