  abstract = {Patellar tendinopathy is a common clinical problem, but its underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood, primarily due to the absence of a representative experimental model. The most widely used method to generate such a model is collagenase injection, although this method possesses limitations. We developed an optimized rat model of patellar tendinopathy via the ultrasound-guided injection of collagenase mixed with a thermo-responsive Pluronic hydrogel into the patellar tendon of sixty male Wistar rats. All analyses were carried out at 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days post-injury. We confirmed that our rat model reproduced the pathophysiology observed in human patients through analyses of ultrasonography, histology, immunofluorescence, and biomechanical parameters. Tendons that were injured by the injection of the collagenase-Pluronic mixture exhibited a significant increase in the cross-sectional area (p {$<$} 0.01), a high degree of tissue disorganization and hypercellularity, significantly strong neovascularization (p {$<$} 0.01), important changes in the levels of types I and III collagen expression, and the organization and presence of intra-tendinous calcifications. Decreases in the maximum rupture force and stiffness were also observed. These results demonstrate that our model replicates the key features observed in human patellar tendinopathy. Collagenase is evenly distributed, as the Pluronic hydrogel prevents its leakage and thus, damage to surrounding tissues. Therefore, this model is valuable for testing new treatments for patellar tendinopathy.},
