  abstract = {QUESTION: What is the effect of injury prevention programs that include balance training exercises on the incidence of ankle injuries among soccer players? DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised trials with meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Soccer players of any age, sex or competition level. INTERVENTIONS: The experimental intervention was an injury prevention program that included balance training exercises. The control intervention was the soccer team's usual warm-up program. OUTCOME MEASURES: Exposure-based ankle injury rates. RESULTS: Nine articles met the inclusion criteria. The pooled results of injury prevention programs that included balance training exercises among 4,959 soccer players showed a 36\% reduction in ankle injury per 1,000 hours of exposure compared to the control group with an injury risk ratio (IRR) of 0.64 (95\% CI 0.54 to 0.77). The pooled results of the F{\'e}d{\'e}ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) injury prevention programs caused a 37\% reduction in ankle injury (IRR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.48 to 0.84) and balance-training exercises alone cause a 42\% reduction in ankle injury (IRR 0.58, 95\% CI 0.41 to 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates that balance exercises alone or as part of an injury prevention program decrease the risk of ankle injuries. PROSPERO CRD42017054450.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of injury prevention programmes on injury incidence in any women's football code; explore relationships between training components and injury risk; and report injury incidence for women's football. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Nine databases searched in August 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any injury prevention programme (eg, exercise, education, braces) were included. Study inclusion criteria were: {$\geq$}20 female football players in each study arm (any age, football code or participation level) and injury incidence reporting. RESULTS: Twelve studies, all in soccer, met inclusion criteria, with nine involving adolescent teams (aged {$<$}18 years). All studies (except one) had a high risk of bias. Eleven studies examined exercise-based programmes, with most (9/11) including multiple ({$\geq$}2) training components (eg, strength, plyometric, balance exercises). Multicomponent exercise programmes reduced overall (any reported) injuries (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.73, 95\%\,CI 0.59 to 0.91) and ACL injuries (IRR 0.55, 95\%\,CI 0.32 to 0.92). For exercise-based strategies (single-component and multicomponent), hamstring injuries were also reduced (IRR 0.40, 95\%\,CI 0.17 to 0.95). While exercise-based strategies resulted in less knee, ankle and hip/groin injuries, and the use of multiple training components was associated with greater reductions in overall and knee injuries, further studies would be required to increase the precision of these results. The incidence of overall injuries in women's football was 3.4 per 1000 exposure hours; with ankle injuries most common. CONCLUSION: In women's football, there is low-level evidence that multicomponent, exercise-based programmes reduce overall and ACL injuries by 27\% and 45\%, respectively.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of soccer (football) injuries is among the highest in sports. Despite this high rate, insufficient evidence is available on the efficacy of preventive training programmes on injury incidence. OBJECTIVE: To systematically study the evidence on preventive exercise-based training programmes to reduce the incidence of injuries in soccer. DATA SOURCES: The databases EMBASE/MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials, PEDro and SPORTDiscusâ„¢ were searched for relevant articles, from inception until 20 December 2011. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the PEDro scale. STUDY SELECTION: The inclusion criteria for this review were (1) randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials; (2) primary outcome of the study is the number of soccer injuries and/or injury incidence; (3) intervention focusing on a preventive training programme, including a set of exercises aimed at improving strength, coordination, flexibility or agility; and (4) study sample of soccer players (no restrictions as to level of play, age or sex). The exclusion criteria were: (1) the article was not available as full text; (2) the article was not published in English, German or Dutch; and (3) the trial and/or training programme relates only to specific injuries and/or specific joints. To compare the effects of the different interventions, we calculated the incidence risk ratio (IRR) for each study. RESULTS: Six studies involving a total of 6,099 participants met the inclusion criteria. The results of the included studies were contradictory. Two of the six studies (one of high and one of moderate quality) reported a statistical significant reduction in terms of their primary outcome, i.e. injuries overall. Four of the six studies described an overall preventive effect (IRR{$<$}1), although the effect of one study was not statistically significant. The three studies that described a significant preventive effect were of high, moderate and low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Conflicting evidence has been found for the effectiveness of exercise-based programmes to prevent soccer injuries. Some reasons for the contradictory findings could be different study samples (in terms of sex and soccer type) in the included studies, differences between the intervention programmes implemented (in terms of content, training frequency and duration) and compliance with the programme. High-quality studies investigating the best type and intensity of exercises in a generic training programme are needed to reduce the incidence of injuries in soccer effectively.},

  abstract = {Participation in youth soccer in the United States continues to increase steadily, with a greater percentage of preadolescent participants than perhaps any other youth sport. Despite the wide-ranging health benefits of participation in organized sports, injuries occur and represent a threat to the health and performance of young athletes. Youth soccer has a greater reported injury rate than many other contact sports, and recent studies suggest that injury rates are increasing. Large increases in the incidence of concussions in youth soccer have been reported, and anterior cruciate ligament injuries remain a significant problem in this sport, particularly among female athletes. Considerable new research has identified a number of modifiable risk factors for lower-extremity injuries and concussion, and several prevention programs have been identified to reduce the risk of injury. Rule enforcement and fair play also serve an important role in reducing the risk of injury among youth soccer participants. This report provides an updated review of the relevant literature as well as recommendations to promote the safe participation of children and adolescents in soccer.},
