  abstract = {The dominant characteristics of the human foot are its shock-absorbing capability during walking or gait cycle and its adaptation to uneven surfaces. On the stance phase of the gait, the foot has to be flexible at first for shock absorption and adapt to the terrain; whereas, during the propulsive phase, it has to be dynamically rigid to function as a lever. Foot flexibility and rigidity are mainly controlled at the subtalar and midtarsal joints by tendons and ligaments. The subtalar joint is part of the longitudinal arch, but the midtarsal joint along with the tarsometatarsal joint are components of the transverse arch. However, the existence and functional role of transverse arch in human was challenged by some authors. But recent studies have revealed that the transverse arch has a predominant role in midfoot stiffness (Venkadeshan et al., 2020, \& Holowoka et al., 2017). This midfoot stiffness allows the human foot to store elastic energy at the time of heel strike, which is utilized during the push-off mechanism for propulsion, thus making bipedalism more energy-efficient. Moreover, the transverse arch allows the longitudinal arch to be flexible like a lever and, at the same time, makes the arch of the foot rigid to behave like a stiff spring lever. Understanding the role of the transverse arch is obligatory to study the biomechanics of foot injuries and Charcot or diabetic foot. Studies on diabetic foot have shown that the modulation of transverse arch biomechanics and off-loading modalities would improve outcomes in the form of wound-healing and prevention of re-ulceration.},

  abstract = {The manner of innervation of the obturator internus, superior and inferior gemelli, and the quadratus femoris in humans (101 pelvic halves) and in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta: 8 pelvic halves) were investigated. In most specimens, the inferior gemellus originated from the lateral surface of the ischial tuberosity and also from the medial surface (intrapelvic origin) just beneath the obturator internus and was covered by the falciform process of the sacrotuberous ligament. The superior gemellus was frequently innervated by the nerve to the obturator internus and the nerve to the quadratus femoris (60.4\%), and the inferior gemellus was innervated by the obturator internus nerve in two specimens. The quadratus femoris nerve originated from more cranial segments than the obturator internus nerve, however these nerves had various communication patterns inside and outside the muscles. According to the intramuscular nerve distribution, in some specimens the branches to the superior gemellus from the quadratus femoris nerve extended to the inferior gemellus, and the branches to the inferior gemellus were distributed to the obturator internus. The present findings revealed that the positional relationships among the branches to the obturator internus and gemelli muscles are relatively constant, although the branching patterns and innervation patterns were varied. The various patterns and routes are considered to reflect the variability of the differentiation patterns of the anlage of the muscles. A possible schematic model of the positional relationships between the muscles and the nerves is proposed.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although bodyweight wall and ball squats are commonly used during patellofemoral rehabilitation, patellofemoral loading while performing these exercises is unknown, which makes it difficult for clinicians to know how to use these exercises in progressing a patient with patellofemoral pathology. Therefore, the purpose was to quantify patellofemoral force and stress between two bodyweight squat variations (ball squat vs wall squat) and between two heel-to-wall-distance (HTWD) variations (long HTWD vs short HTWD). METHODS: Sixteen participants performed a dynamic ball squat and wall squat with long HTWD and short HTWD. Ground reaction force and kinematic data were used to measure resultant knee force and torque from inverse dynamics, whereas electromyographic data were used in a knee muscle model to predict resultant knee force and torque, and subsequently, all these data were inputted into a biomechanical computer optimization model to output patellofemoral joint force and stress at select knee angles. A repeated-measures two- and three-way ANOVA ( P {$<$} 0.01) was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Collapsed across long HTWD and short HTWD, patellofemoral joint force and stress were greater in ball squat than wall squat at 30{$^\circ$} ( P = 0.009), 40{$^\circ$} ( P = 0.008), 90{$^\circ$} ( P = 0.003), and 100{$^\circ$} ( P = 0.005) knee angles during the squat descent, and greater in wall squat than ball squat at 100{$^\circ$} ( P {$<$} 0.001), 90{$^\circ$} ( P {$<$} 0.001), 80{$^\circ$} ( P = 0.004), and 70{$^\circ$} ( P = 0.009) knee angles during squat ascent. Collapsed across ball and wall squats, patellofemoral joint force and stress were greater with a short HTWD than a long HTWD at 100{$^\circ$} ( P = 0.007) and 90{$^\circ$} ( P = 0.008) knee angles during squat ascent. CONCLUSIONS: Patellofemoral joint loading changed according to both squat type and HTWD variations. These differences occurred in part due to differences in forces the wall or ball exerted on the trunk, including friction forces. Overall, patellofemoral force and stress were greater performing the bodyweight wall squat compared with the bodyweight ball squat. Moreover, squatting with short HTWD produced anterior knee displacement beyond the toes at higher knee angles, resulting in greater patellofemoral force and stress compared with squatting with long HTWD.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The insertional anatomy of the FHB tendon was measured in 30 fresh frozen cadaver specimens. The FHB was then cyclically loaded and bone sequentially removed from the proximal phalangeal base until specimen failure occurred. RESULTS: The mean length of the lateral and medial FHB insertions measured 9.0 +/- 0.6 mm and 8.0 +/- 0.5 mm, respectively (p {$<$} 0.0001). The mean width of the lateral and medial FHB insertions measured 7.1 +/- 1.0 mm and 8.8 +/- 1.4 mm, respectively (p {$<$} 0.0001). FHB insertion length as a percentage of total proximal phalangeal length was 26\% +/- 3\% medially and 30\% +/- 3\% laterally. Twenty-two specimens failed at the FHB insertion site after an average of 7.8 +/- 1.0 mm or 24\% +/- 3\% of the total length of the proximal phalanx had been resected from the base. CONCLUSION: Six millimeters of bone or 20\% of the proximal phalangeal length could be safely removed from the hallux proximal phalangeal base without compromising the integrity of the FHB insertion to a physiologic load. Retaining 10 mm of the hallux proximal phalangeal base during amputation would preserve the medial FHB insertion and sacrifice none to less than 0.4 mm of the lateral insertion in our specimens. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates how much hallux proximal phalangeal base can be resected during first MTP arthroplasty or needs to be retained during amputation to preserve FHB function.},

The LHB and SHB were replaced by spring devices and translation tests at 90 degrees abduction of the arm were performed by applying a 1.5 kg anterior force. The position of the humeral head was monitored by an electromagnetic tracking device with or without an anterior translational force; with 0 kg, 1.5 kg or 3 kg loads applied on either LHB or SHB tendons in 60 degrees, 90 degrees or 120 degrees of external rotation; and with the capsule intact, vented, or damaged by a Bankart lesion. The anterior displacement of the humeral head under 1.5 kg force was significantly decreased by both the LHB and SHB loading in all capsular conditions when the arm was in 60 degrees or 90 degrees of external rotation. At 120 degrees of external rotation, anterior displacement was significantly decreased by LHB and SHB loading only when there was a Bankart lesion. We conclude that LHB and SHB have similar functions as anterior stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint with the arm in abduction and external rotation, and that their role increases as shoulder stability decreases. Both heads of the biceps have been shown to have a stabilising function in resisting anterior head displacement, and consideration should therefore be given to strengthening the biceps during rehabilitation programmes for chronic anterior instability of the shoulder.},

Analysis of variance designs indicated that when the knee was passively extended from 90{$^\circ$} to 0{$^\circ$}, shear modulus of the TLF, SMF, and STF increased significantly (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Similarly, active knee flexion contractions caused a significant increase in TLF, SMF, and STF shear modulus (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Compared to hamstring fascia, the TLF showed greater thickness but a lower shear modulus (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) while STF modulus was greater compared that to SMF during active contraction (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). These results indicate that exercising the hamstring muscles can remotely influence the stiffness of the fascia which surrounds the lumbar area.},

RESULTS: With the capsule intact, anterior displacement was significantly reduced by application of load to the middle deltoid muscle. After the capsule was vented, load application to the anterior, middle, or posterior deltoid muscle significantly reduced anterior displacement. With a simulated Bankart lesion, effects of muscle loading were most apparent: anterior displacement was significantly reduced with loading of each muscle portion.

PURPOSE: This review aims to concisely present the literature on LT tendinopathy and tears in order to guide health care professionals in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on the diagnosis and surgical management of ligamentum teres tendinopathy and tears. CONCLUSIONS: The ligamentum teres is an important stabilizer to the hip joint, particularly with hip flexion and external rotation. Older age and acetabular bony pathomorphology are two of the known risk factors for LT tears. Symptoms of LT tendinopathy are largely non-specific, mimicking a wide range of other hip disorders including impingement and instability. Debridement of LT tears or reactive tissue has been reported with good outcomes, with more recent studies describing reconstruction of a completely torn, nonfunctional, or absent LT using various graft sources including synthetic grafts, autografts, and allografts.

  abstract = {Although there is much morphological variation in the anterior compartment of the leg, there is little information about the morphological variability of the fibularis tertius muscle (FTM). The main aim of the present study was to characterize the morphology (origin and insertion) and frequency of occurrence of the FTM and to use these findings as the basis for a new classification of the fibularis tertius tendon. Classical anatomical dissection was performed on 106 lower limbs fixed in 10\% formalin. The presence of the FTM and the morphology of both its origin and its insertion were described. The FTM was present in 91 limbs (85.8\%). Three types of origin were observed: Type 1, the most common type, with its origin on the distal half fibula (67\%); Type 2, with the origin on the distal third fibula (22\%); and Type 3, with an origin from the tendon of the extensor digitorum longus (11\%). In addition, six types of insertion were distinguished. The most common was Type I (45\%), a single distal attachment where the tendon inserts into the shaft of the fifth metatarsal bone. The rarest was Type VI, characterized by fusion with an additional band of the fibularis brevis tendon, which gives rise to the fourth interosseus dorsalis muscle. Two morphological variants of insertion could be distinguished, fan-shaped and band-shaped. Both the origin and insertion of the FTM are very morphologically variable, with three types of origin (Types 1-3) and six types of insertion point (Types I-VI) observed. Knowledge of such variations is essential for both clinicians and anatomists. Clin. Anat. 32:1082-1093, 2019. {\copyright} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {To evaluate anatomic variability in the insertion of the adductor hallucis into the lateral sesamoid and proximal phalanx of the great toe and to evaluate the extent of release of the adductor hallucis tendon performed through an incision in the dorsal first-web space, we recorded the angle of hallux valgus in 42 fresh-frozen specimens from human cadavers. An incision was made for a realignment of the soft tissues, dissecting down to the level of the intermetatarsal ligament. A loop of suture was placed around the identifiable adductor hallucis tendon through this incision along the lateral aspect of the lateral sesamoid. Then a plantar dissection removed all soft tissue to the level of the intermetatarsal ligament, adductor hallucis (transverse and oblique heads), lateral sesamoid, and lateral flexor hallucis brevis. The Insertion of these muscles into the proximal phalanx was evaluated. Specifically, we looked for separate slips of the adductor tendon inserting into the base of the proximal phalanx or separate insertions of the adductor tendon and the tendon of the flexor hallucis brevis muscle. In 33 of the 42 specimens, the entire adductor hallucis tendon had been isolated by the loop of suture through the incision in the dorsal first web. In eight of the remaining nine specimens, a small slip of the tendon (comprising less than 25\% of its substance) had not been included. No specimen was found to have a separate slip of the adductor tendon inserting into the base of the proximal phalanx. Instead, all specimens were found to have only a conjoined insertion of fibers of the adductor hallucis and of the flexor hallucis brevis from the lateral sesamoid into the base of the proximal phalanx. We did not identify a separate tendon-insertion into the proximal phalanx in any specimen. Therefore, great caution should be exercised in releasing an isolated insertion of the adductor tendon from the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe since it may actually represent the conjoined insertion of the lateral flexor hallucis brevis tendon and the adductor tendon. We found that by simply releasing the adductor tendon from its insertion along the lateral aspect of the sesamoid, accomplished through an incision in the dorsal first web, that an adequate release was achieved in most specimens.},

  abstract = {The effects of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition following the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament remain unclear. We examined the effects of selective COX-2 and nonselective COX inhibition on bone-tendon integration in an in vitro model. We measured the dose-dependent effects of ibuprofen and parecoxib on the viability of lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated and unstimulated mouse MC3T3-E1 and 3T3 cells, the influence on gene expression at the osteoblast, interface, and fibroblast regions measured by quantitative PCR, and cellular outgrowth assessed on histological sections. Ibuprofen led to a dose-dependent suppression of MC3T3 cell viability, while parecoxib reduced the viability of 3T3 cultures. Exposure to ibuprofen significantly suppressed expression of Alpl (P {$<$} 0.01), Bglap (P {$<$} 0.001), and Runx2 (P {$<$} 0.01), and although parecoxib reduced expression of Alpl (P {$<$} 0.001), Fmod (P {$<$} 0.001), and Runx2 (P {$<$} 0.01), the expression of Bglap was increased (P {$<$} 0.01). Microscopic analysis showed a reduction in cellular outgrowth in LPS-stimulated cultures following exposure to ibuprofen and parecoxib. Nonselective COX inhibition and the specific inhibition of COX-2 led to region-specific reductions in markers of calcification and cell viability. We suggest further in vitro and in vivo studies examining the biologic and biomechanical effects of selective and nonselective COX inhibition.},

  abstract = {The myotome of a muscle is the basis for diagnosing spinal and peripheral nerve disorders. Despite its critical importance in clinical neurology, myotome charts presented in many textbooks, surprisingly, show non-negligible discordances with each other. Many authors do not even clearly state the bases of their charts. Studies that have presented with raw data regarding myotome identification are rather rare. A classic study in the 19th century that pursued the nerve course in cadavers still has a substantial influence on existing charts, despite its definite limitations. Other scarce studies in humans include identification by root stimulation during surgery, clinical observations in root avulsion or spinal cord injury and clinical and electromyographical investigations in patients with single radiculopathies or certain plexopathies. A few recent studies have proposed new theories regarding the myotomes of some muscles. T1 innervation of the median intrinsic hand muscles is a typical example. We have added a number of new findings, such as T1 innervation of the forearm flexor muscles innervated by the median nerve except the pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis, C5 innervation of the brachioradialis, and two C6 indicator muscles, pronator teres and extensor carpi radialis brevis. Increased accuracy of the myotome charts will improve the localisation in neurology.},

  abstract = {Plantaris muscle (lat. musculus plantaris) is a fusiform muscle of the superficial posterior leg compartment, characterized with a small muscle belly and very long and slender tendon. Many anatomical variations of plantaris muscle have been reported previously, including its inconstancy. Evolutional studies strongly suggest that plantaris muscle is a rudimentary muscle that plays minor role in gait biomechanics. However, plantaris muscle seems to have very important proprioceptive role since it has very high density of muscle spindles. Clinically, plantaris muscle is involved in differential diagnosis of posterior leg pain and several pathological entities such as: plantaris muscle rupture, non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy and popliteal artery compression syndrome. Different surgical specialties have recognized plantaris muscle tendon as a valuable graft. However, literature on plantaris muscle tendon biomechanical properties is rather scant and inconsistent with several limitations for proper data comparison and interpretation. Further comparative studies are needed to properly define biomechanical properties of plantaris muscle tendon grafts for various ligament and tendon reconstructive procedures.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In this overview, new and existent material on the organization and composition of the thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) will be evaluated in respect to its anatomy, innervation biomechanics and clinical relevance. The integration of the passive connective tissues of the TLF and active muscular structures surrounding this structure are discussed, and the relevance of their mutual interactions in relation to low back and pelvic pain reviewed. The TLF is a girdling structure consisting of several aponeurotic and fascial layers that separates the paraspinal muscles from the muscles of the posterior abdominal wall. The superficial lamina of the posterior layer of the TLF (PLF) is dominated by the aponeuroses of the latissimus dorsi and the serratus posterior inferior. The deeper lamina of the PLF forms an encapsulating retinacular sheath around the paraspinal muscles. The middle layer of the TLF (MLF) appears to derive from an intermuscular septum that developmentally separates the epaxial from the hypaxial musculature. This septum forms during the fifth and sixth weeks of gestation. The paraspinal retinacular sheath (PRS) is in a key position to act as a `hydraulic amplifier', assisting the paraspinal muscles in supporting the lumbosacral spine. This sheath forms a lumbar interfascial triangle (LIFT) with the MLF and PLF. Along the lateral border of the PRS, a raphe forms where the sheath meets the aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis. This lateral raphe is a thickened complex of dense connective tissue marked by the presence of the LIFT, and represents the junction of the hypaxial myofascial compartment (the abdominal muscles) with the paraspinal sheath of the epaxial muscles. The lateral raphe is in a position to distribute tension from the surrounding hypaxial and extremity muscles into the layers of the TLF. At the base of the lumbar spine all of the layers of the TLF fuse together into a thick composite that attaches firmly to the posterior superior iliac spine and the sacrotuberous ligament. This thoracolumbar composite (TLC) is in a position to assist in maintaining the integrity of the lower lumbar spine and the sacroiliac joint. The three-dimensional structure of the TLF and its caudally positioned composite will be analyzed in light of recent studies concerning the cellular organization of fascia, as well as its innervation. Finally, the concept of a TLC will be used to reassess biomechanical models of lumbopelvic stability, static posture and movement.},

  abstract = {The two functional bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), namely, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles, must work in concert to control displacement of the tibia relative to the femur for complex motions. Thus, the replacement graft(s) for a torn ACL should possess similar tension patterns. The objective of the study was to examine whether a double-bundle ACL reconstruction with the semitendinosus-gracilis autografts could replicate the tension patterns of those for the intact ACL under controlled in vitro loading conditions. By means of a robotic/universal force moment sensor (UFS) testing system, the in situ force vectors (both magnitude and direction) for the AM and PL bundles of the ACL, as well as their respective replacement grafts, were determined and compared on nine human cadaveric knees. It was found that double-bundle ACL reconstruction could closely replicate the in situ force vectors. Under a 134-N anterior tibial load, the resultant force vectors for the intact ACL and the reconstructed ACL had a difference of 5 to 11 N (p {$>$} 0.05) in magnitude and 1 to 13 degrees (p {$>$} 0.05) in direction. Whereas, under combined rotatory loads of 10-N-m valgus and 5-N-m internal tibial torques, the corresponding differences were 10 to 16 N and 4 degrees to 11 degrees, respectively. Again, there were no statistically significant differences except at 30 degrees of flexion where the force vector for the AM graft had a 15 degrees (p {$<$} 0.05) lower elevation angle than did the AM bundle.},
