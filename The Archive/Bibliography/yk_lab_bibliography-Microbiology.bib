  abstract = {Creatine phosphokinase (CPK), also known by the name creatine kinase (CK), is the enzyme that catalyzes~the reaction of creatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP).~This CPK enzyme reaction is reversible; thus, ATP can be generated from PCr and ADP. The phosphocreatine created from this reaction is used to supply tissues and cells that require substantial amounts of ATP, like the brain, skeletal muscles, and the heart, with their required ATP.~Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is a central controller of cellular energy homeostasis. Many conditions can cause derangement in CPK levels, including rhabdomyolysis, heart disease, kidney disease, or even certain medications.},

  abstract = {Found in all vertebrates, creatine kinase catalyzes the reversible reaction of creatine and ATP forming phosphocreatine and ADP. Phosphocreatine may be viewed as a reservoir of "high-energy phosphate" which is able to supply ATP, the primary energy source in bioenergetics, on demand. Consequently, creatine kinase plays a significant role in energy homeostasis of cells with intermittently high energy requirements. The enzyme is of clinical importance and its levels are routinely used as an indicator of myocardial and skeletal muscle disorders and for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. First identified in 1928, the enzyme has undergone intensive investigation for over 75 years. There are four major isozymes, two cytosolic and two mitochondrial, which form dimers and octamers, respectively. Depending on the pH, the enzyme operates by a random or an ordered bimolecular mechanism, with the equilibrium lying towards phosphocreatine production. Evidence suggests that conversion of creatine to phosphocreatine occurs via the in-line transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP. A recent X-ray structure of creatine kinase bound to a transition state analog complex confirmed many of the predictions based on kinetic, spectroscopic, and mutagenesis studies. This review summarizes and correlates the more significant mechanistic and structural studies on creatine kinase.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Elevation of the chemokine CXCL13 in CSF frequently occurs during active and acute CNS inflammatory processes and presumably is associated with B cell-related immune activation. Elevation levels, however, vary a lot and "leaking" of CXCL13 from blood across dysfunctional brain barriers is a possible source. The aim was to clarify the relation between CXCL13 concentrations in CSF, CXCL13 concentrations in serum and blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) function for a correct interpretation of the intrathecal origin of CXCL13. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed CXCL13 of banked CSF/serum samples (n\,=\,69) selected from patient records and categorized the CSF CXCL13 elevations as CXCL13 negative ({$<$}\,30~pg/ml), low (30-100~pg/ml), medium (101-250~pg/ml), or high ({$>$}\,250~pg/ml). CXCL13 concentrations in CSF and serum and the corresponding CSF/serum CXCL13 quotients (Qcxcl13) were compared to CSF/serum albumin quotients (QAlb) as a measure for BCSFB function. The CXCL13 negative category included two subgroups with normal and dysfunctional BCSFB. RESULTS: Serum CXCL13 concentrations were similar across categories with median levels around 100~pg/ml but differed between individuals (29 to {$>$}\,505~pg/ml). Despite clear evidence in serum, CXCL13 was detectable only at trace amounts (medians 3.5 and 7.5~pg/ml) in CSF of the two CXCL13 negative subgroups irrespective of a normal or pathological QAlb. Moreover, we found no association between CSF and serum CXCL13 levels or between QAlb and CSF CXCL13 levels in any of the CSF CXCL13-delineated categories. CXCL13 apparently does not "leak" from blood into CSF. This implies an intrathecal origin also for low CSF CXCL13 levels and a caveat for analyzing the Qcxcl13, because higher serum than CSF concentrations arithmetically depress the Qcxcl13 resulting in misleadingly low CSF/serum quotients. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CXCL13 does not cross from blood into CSF, not even during severe BCSFB dysfunction. CSF CXCL13 elevations therefore most likely always are CNS-derived, which highlights their relevance as indicator of inflammatory CNS processes. We recommend data should not be corrected for BCSFB permeability (QAlb) and not to calculate CSF/serum quotients for CXCL13 as these may introduce error.},
