Every person with migraine requires treatment for acute attacks. Treatments can range from behavioral management and nonspecific medications to migraine-specific medications and neuromodulation. For many with migraine, having a combination of tools allows for effective treatment of all types of attacks.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Over the past several years, four neuromodulation devices have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of acute migraine, and three medications with novel mechanisms of action have been FDA approved. They add to the arsenal available to people with migraine and focus on migraine-specific pathways to allow for precise care with fewer side effects.                                         SUMMARY               This article discusses acute migraine therapy, focusing on best-level evidence.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               The migraine postdrome is the least studied and least understood phase of migraine. This article covers the salient features of the migraine postdrome and provides insight into the history, clinical symptoms, and future implications of this phase of migraine.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Prospective electronic diary studies have shown that patients are left disabled with various nonheadache symptoms in the migraine postdrome, and 81\% of patients report at least one nonheadache symptom in the postdrome. Hence, it is important to understand this phase better and ensure that more effective treatments become available in the future to lessen the morbidity associated with this phase. Functional imaging shows widespread reduction in brain-blood flow in the postdrome, which explains the multitudes of symptoms experienced by patients.                                         SUMMARY               The disability related to migraine is not exclusive to the headache phase but extends into the postdrome phase and is associated with several nonheadache symptoms that prolong the symptoms experienced by patients with migraine. Further research into the postdrome is crucial to improve our overall understanding of migraine mechanisms. This knowledge may also help to treat the concurrent nonheadache symptoms better in the future. Novel neuroimaging techniques provide a valuable noninvasive tool to push the frontiers in the understanding of migraine pathophysiology. These methods may help shed further light onto the possible links between key brain structures and networks that could be implicated in the pathophysiology of the various migraine phases.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The migraine preventive treatment landscape has been transformed by the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP or its receptor. These treatments, which are given subcutaneously or intravenously monthly or quarterly, have high efficacy and were well tolerated in clinical trials. Emerging real-world studies have found higher rates of adverse events than were seen in clinical trials. They are currently recommended for use if two traditional preventive therapies have proven inadequate. Since the commonly cited 2012 American Headache Society/American Academy of Neurology migraine prevention guidelines were released, clinical trials supporting the preventive use of lisinopril, candesartan, and memantine have been published. Neuromodulation devices, including external trigeminal nerve stimulation and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation devices, have modest evidence to support preventive use. The American Headache Society/American Academy of Neurology guidelines for the preventive treatment of migraine are currently being updated. A new class of oral CGRP receptor antagonists (gepants) is being tested for migraine prevention.                                         SUMMARY               Successful preventive treatment of migraine reduces disease burden and improves quality of life. Many pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options are available for the prevention of migraine, including newer therapies aimed at the CGRP pathway as well as older treatments with good evidence for efficacy. Multiple treatment trials may be required to find the best preventive for an individual patient.},

The TACs are composed of five diseases: cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT), short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA), and hemicrania continua.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                New classifications for the TACs have two important updates; chronic cluster headache is now defined as remission periods lasting less than 3 months (formerly less than 1 month), and hemicrania continua is now classified as a TAC (formerly classified as                 other primary headache                 ). The first-line treatments of TACs have not changed in recent years: cluster headache is managed with oxygen, triptans, and verapamil; paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua are managed with indomethacin; and SUNCT and SUNA are managed with lamotrigine. However, advancements in neuromodulation have recently provided additional options for patients with cluster headache, which include noninvasive devices for abortive therapy and invasive devices for refractory cluster headache. Patient selection for these devices is key.                                                        SUMMARY               The TACs are a group of diseases that appear similar to each other and to other headache disorders but have important differences. Proper diagnosis is crucial for proper treatment. This article reviews the pathophysiology, epidemiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of the TACs.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Prospective clinical studies have reinforced the understanding that migraine aura is highly variable from one individual to the next as well as from attack to attack in an individual. While migraine with aura clearly has a higher heritability than migraine without aura, population studies have not identified specific genes that underlie this heritability for typical migraine with aura. Imaging studies reveal hypoperfusion associated with migraine aura, although the timing and distribution of this hypoperfusion is not strictly correlated with migraine symptoms. Mapping of migraine visual aura symptoms onto the visual cortex suggests that the mechanisms underlying the aura propagate in a linear fashion along gyri or sulci rather than as a concentric wave and also suggests that aura may propagate in the absence of clinical symptoms. Cortical spreading depression in animal models continues to be a translational model for migraine, and the study of spreading depolarizations in the injured human brain has provided new insight into potential mechanisms of cortical spreading depression in migraine. Migraine with aura has multiple comorbidities including patent foramen ovale, stroke, and psychiatric disorders; the shared mechanisms underlying these comorbidities remains a topic of active investigation.                                         SUMMARY               Although it occurs in the minority of patients with migraine, aura may have much to teach us about basic mechanisms of migraine. In addition, its occurrence may influence clinical management regarding comorbid conditions and acute and preventive therapy.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Headache disorders attributed to low and high intracranial pressure are commonly encountered in specialty headache practices and may occur more frequently than realized. While the headaches resulting from intracranial pressure disorders have what are conventionally thought of as defining characteristics, a substantial minority of patients do not manifest the ``typical'' features. Moreover, patients with intracranial pressure disorders may also have a preexisting primary headache disorder. Heightening the complexity of the presentation, the headaches of intracranial pressure disorders can resemble the phenotype of a primary disorder. Lastly, patients with so-called intracranial ``hypotension'' often have normal CSF pressure and neuroimaging studies. Thus, a high index of suspicion is needed. The published literature has inherent bias as many types of specialists evaluate and treat these conditions. This article reviews the key points to emphasize the history, examination, and laboratory evaluation of patients with intracranial pressure disorders from a neurologist's perspective.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Lumbar puncture opening pressure in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension was low enough to meet diagnostic criteria ({$\leq$}60 mm CSF) in only 34\% of patients in one study. Most patients had an opening pressure in the low normal to normal range, and 5\% had an opening pressure of 200 mm CSF or more. Diskogenic microspurs are a common cause of this syndrome. The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial found that most participants had a headache phenotype resembling migraine or tension-type headache. No ``typical'' or characteristic headache phenotype was found, and headache-related disability was severe at baseline. Headache disability did not correlate with the lumbar puncture opening pressure at baseline or at the 6-month primary outcome period. Although participants who were randomly assigned to acetazolamide had a lower mean CSF opening pressure at 6 months, headache disability in that group was similar to the group who received placebo.                                         SUMMARY               Significant overlap is seen in the symptoms of high and low CSF pressure disorders and in those of primary headache disorders. Neurologists are frequently challenged by patients with headaches who lack the typical clinical signs or imaging features of the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome or spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Even when characteristic symptoms and signs are initially present, the typical features of both syndromes tend to lessen or resolve over time; consider these diagnoses in patients with long-standing ``chronic migraine'' who do not improve with conventional headache treatment. While the diagnostic criteria for pseudotumor cerebri syndrome accurately identify most patients with the disorder, at least 25\% of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension have normal imaging and over half have a normal lumbar puncture opening pressure. Detailed history taking will often give clues that suggest a CSF pressure disorder. That said, misdiagnosis can lead to significant patient morbidity and inappropriate therapy.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Four triptans are now labeled by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acute migraine treatment in adolescents, and rizatriptan is labeled for use in children age 6 and older. For preventive migraine treatment, the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention trial demonstrated that approximately 60\% of children and adolescents with migraine will improve with a three-pronged treatment approach that includes: (1) lifestyle management counseling (on sleep, exercise, hydration, caffeine, and avoidance of meal skipping); (2) optimally dosed acute therapy, specifically nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans; and (3) a preventive treatment that has some evidence for efficacy. For the remaining 40\% of children and adolescents, and for those who would not have qualified for the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention trial because of having continuous headache or medication-overuse headache, the clinician's judgment remains the best guide to preventive therapy selection.

RECENT FINDINGS               Since 2014, functional imaging studies have been conducted during the premonitory stage of migraine and have provided novel insights into the early neurobiology and anatomy of the earliest stage of the migraine attack. These studies have shown early involvement of subcortical brain areas including the hypothalamus, substantia nigra, dorsal pons, and various limbic cortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex during the premonitory phase. More recent work has revealed altered hypothalamic-brainstem functional connectivity during migraine, which starts before the onset of pain.

Despite their unique features, TACs often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for several years, leading to unnecessary pain and suffering. A significant proportion of TAC presentations may have secondary causes.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The underlying pathophysiology of TACs is likely rooted in hypothalamic dysfunction and derangements in the interplay of circuitry involving trigeminovascular, trigeminocervical, trigeminoautonomic, circadian, and nociceptive systems. Recent therapeutic advancements include a better understanding of how to use older therapies more effectively and the identification of new approaches.                                         SUMMARY               TAC syndromes are rare but important to recognize because of their debilitating nature and greater likelihood for having potentially serious underlying causes. Although treatment options have remained somewhat limited, scientific inquiry is continually advancing our understanding of these syndromes and how best to manage them.},

Understanding the presentation of headache in women in relation to hormonal changes both during the menstrual cycle and throughout the life span is essential for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although perimenstrual migraine attacks are generally without aura, the diagnosis of migraine with aura has been added to the headache classification for menstrual migraine to account for women with the diagnosis of migraine with aura who experience menstrual migraine attacks. Emerging knowledge regarding the differences between menstrual and nonmenstrual attacks, the variability of attack triggering within and between women, and the response of women with menstrually related migraine to new migraine drug classes is contributing to better understanding and more effective treatment of these particularly burdensome and refractory attacks. Given the burden of migraine, almost one-fourth of women with migraine avoid or delay pregnancy. Women who experience migraine during pregnancy are more likely to have a hypertensive disorder and stroke during pregnancy and/or delivery and the postpartum period. Treatment of headache in general and migraine in particular in pregnancy is challenging because of fetal and maternal risks; however, a 2021 systematic review suggests that triptans and low-dose aspirin may not be associated with fetal/child adverse effects and could be more strongly considered for headache treatment in pregnancy.                                         SUMMARY               Headache in general and migraine in particular are extraordinarily common in women of reproductive age and fluctuate with hormonal changes and phases of life. Improved knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and response to treatment of perimenstrual attacks is essential for more effective response to this most burdensome headache type. Treatment of headache in pregnancy remains challenging.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Recent functional neuroimaging studies focusing on the nonpainful symptoms of migraine have identified key areas of the central nervous system implicated in the early phases of a migraine attack. Clinical studies of spontaneous and provoked migraine attacks, together with preclinical studies using translational animal models, have led to a better understanding of the disease and the development of disease-specific and targeted therapies.                                         SUMMARY               Our knowledge of the pathophysiology of migraine has advanced significantly in the past decades.

RECENT FINDINGS               After pivotal clinical trials, onabotulinumtoxinA has become an established preventive therapy for chronic migraine; it is better tolerated than many other treatments and may be useful for other headache disorders. Peripheral nerve blocks, especially greater occipital nerve blocks, have amassed evidence from randomized trials in the acute and short-term preventive treatment of migraine and cluster headache. Trigger point injections and sphenopalatine ganglion blocks have recent trials suggesting efficacy and safety in properly selected patients.

This article reviews the importance of proper diagnosis, natural history, and management of headache disorders in pregnant and postpartum women.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Red flags for secondary headache specifically among pregnant women include elevated blood pressure and lack of a previous headache history, as well as a prolonged duration of the headache attack in those with a prior history of migraine. Migraine improvement is typical for most pregnant women, but the prognosis for women who have migraine with aura or chronic migraine is less predictable. Migraine is now an established risk factor for the development of preeclampsia. Recent data suggest hazards for compounds containing butalbital and possibly a better safety profile for triptans than previously believed during pregnancy. Peripheral nerve blocks and noninvasive neurostimulation devices are procedural and emerging therapies that have promising safety profiles for pregnant women with headache disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Acute headache occurring in pregnancy and the postpartum period is a red flag requiring diagnostic vigilance. Migraine frequency in women typically improves during pregnancy, although this trend is less certain when aura is present and after delivery. Acute and preventive treatment plans during pregnancy and lactation are plausible but may require shifts in therapeutic hierarchy. Relatively safe oral, parenteral, and procedural therapies are available for pregnant women. Noninvasive neuromodulation devices are already available and will likely play a greater role in the coming years. Migraine is associated with medical and obstetrical complications during pregnancy, and women with frequent migraine attacks may need to be considered high risk.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Most cases of trigeminal neuralgia are related to vascular compression, a demyelinating plaque, or a compressive mass affecting the trigeminal nerve. However, recent studies have shown that up to 11\% of patients have a family history of trigeminal neuralgia, suggesting that some patients may have a genetic predisposition to demyelination or nerve hyperexcitability. In these patients, trigeminal neuralgia may occur at a younger age, on both sides of the face, or in combination with other neuralgias.                                         SUMMARY               When a patient presents with neuralgic pain, the diagnosis is made by careful history and neurologic examination, with attention to the dermatome involved, the triggers, and the presence of any associated sensory deficit. All patients with new neuralgia or neuropathic facial pain warrant a careful evaluation for a secondary cause. The presence of sensory deficit on bedside examination is particularly concerning for an underlying secondary etiology.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Lifestyle modifications and migraine trigger avoidance are recommended as preventive measures for all individuals with migraine. The decision to recommend additional migraine preventive therapy should consider the frequency of migraine attacks and headaches, extent of migraine-associated disability, frequency of using acute migraine treatments and the responsiveness to such treatments, and patient preferences. Additional therapies include prescription medications, nutraceuticals, neurostimulation, and behavioral therapy. Considering evidence for efficacy and the risk of potential side effects and adverse events, treatments with the most favorable profiles include (in alphabetical order): amitriptyline, beta-blockers (several), biofeedback, candesartan, coenzyme Q10, cognitive-behavioral therapy, magnesium citrate, onabotulinumtoxinA (for chronic migraine only), relaxation therapy, riboflavin, and topiramate. In addition, erenumab, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor monoclonal antibody, received  approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of migraine in May 2018.

Individual treatment recommendations are determined based upon evidence for efficacy, side effect and adverse event profiles, medication interactions, patient comorbidity, costs, and patient preferences. Patients must be counseled on reasonable expectations for their preventive therapy and the importance of adhering to the recommended treatment plan for a period of time that is sufficient to determine outcomes.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cough-induced headache requires neuroimaging to exclude posterior fossa pathology and recently has been reported as a common symptom in patients with CSF-venous fistula. Clinical overlap is observed between patients with primary exercise headache and primary headache associated with sexual activity. Patients with recurrent thunderclap headache associated with sexual activity should be presumed to have reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome until proven otherwise. De novo external-pressure headache is a common sequela among health care workers using personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. New daily persistent headache is an important mimicker of chronic migraine or chronic tension-type headache and is distinguished by a daily-from-onset progression of persistent headache; a treatment-refractory course is often observed, and early involvement of a multidisciplinary team, including a psychotherapist, is advised.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with primary headache disorders that are classified as ``other primary headache disorders'' have presentations with unique diagnostic and management considerations. The disorders are highly recognizable, and an appreciation of the diagnoses will aid clinicians in providing safe and effective care for patients presenting with headache.},

SUMMARY               Headache is a common symptom in children, and it is important to take a detailed history and perform a thorough physical examination to make the diagnosis. Nearly 1 in 10 children experience recurrent headaches due to migraine, which cause significant impairment in school performance and quality of life. The acute and preventive treatments that are currently available will help at least two-thirds of children with migraine, and several trials of new therapies offer hope for the future.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a disorder caused by spinal CSF leakage. This article reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The hallmark symptom of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is acute orthostatic headache; however, clinical presentations can be heterogeneous. New evidence shows that lumbar puncture is not always necessary or sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Some patients may have normal opening pressure, which suggests that insufficiency of CSF volume (hypovolemia) rather than CSF pressure might be the underlying mechanism. Several neuroimaging modalities can aid in diagnosis and localization of the CSF leakage, including brain MRI, spinal MRI, CT myelography, digital subtraction myelography, and radionuclide cisternography. Complications, such as subdural hematoma, can lead to a change in the headache pattern and potentially life-threatening consequences. Conservative treatments, such as fluid supplementation, can provide temporary relief; however, epidural blood patches, especially targeted ones, are more effective and definitive. For patients with refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension, surgical repair of spinal CSF leakages should be considered.                                         SUMMARY               Brain and spinal MRIs are important for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Early treatment with epidural blood patches may be considered to shorten the disease duration and minimize the potential risk of complications.},
