  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Determining the etiology of disorders that manifest with chronic dizziness can seem a daunting task, but extracting some basic elements of the patient's history can reduce the differential diagnosis significantly. This includes determining initial triggers, timing of symptoms, associated features, and exacerbating factors. This article covers distinct causes of chronic dizziness including persistent postural perceptual dizziness, mal de d{\'e}barquement syndrome, motion sickness and visually induced motion sickness, bilateral vestibulopathy, and persistent dizziness after mild concussion. RECENT FINDINGS: To date, none of the disorders above has a cure but are considered chronic syndromes with fluctuations that are both innate and driven by environmental stressors. As such, the mainstay of therapy for chronic disorders of dizziness involves managing factors that exacerbate symptoms and adding vestibular rehabilitation or cognitive-behavioral therapy alone or in combination, as appropriate. These therapies are supplemented by serotonergic antidepressants that modulate sensory gating and reduce anxiety. Besides expectation management, ruling out concurrent disorders and recognizing behavioral and lifestyle factors that affect symptom severity are critical issues in reducing morbidity for each disorder. SUMMARY: Many syndromes of chronic dizziness can be diagnosed by recognition of key features, although many symptoms overlap between these groups. Symptoms may be manageable and improve with time, but they are often incompletely relieved.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Conditions causing recurrent spontaneous episodes of dizziness or vertigo span several medical specialties, making it challenging for clinicians to gain confidence in evaluating and managing the spectrum of episodic vestibular disorders. Patients are often asymptomatic and have normal examinations at the time of evaluation. Thus, diagnosis depends heavily on eliciting key features from the history. Overreliance on symptom quality descriptions commonly leads to misdiagnosis. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with a straightforward approach to the diagnosis and management of conditions that cause episodic spontaneous dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS: Consensus diagnostic criteria have been established for vestibular migraine, M{\'e}ni{\`e}re disease, vestibular paroxysmia, and hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo. Vertigo has been recognized as a common symptom in vertebrobasilar ischemia, cardiogenic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. Treatment recommendations for vestibular migraine still lack high-quality evidence, but controlled trials are occurring. SUMMARY: The evaluation should start with a detailed description of the episodes from the patient and any observers. Rather than focusing first on whether the symptom quality is most consistent with vertigo, dizziness, lightheadedness, or unsteadiness, the clinician should clarify the timing (episode frequency and duration), possible triggers or circumstances (eg, position changes, upright posture), and accompanying symptoms. History should identify any auditory symptoms, migraine features, posterior circulation ischemic symptoms, vascular risk factors, clues for anxiety, and potentially relevant medications. Carefully selected testing can help secure the diagnosis, but excessive and indiscriminate testing can lead to more confusion. Treatments for these conditions are vastly different, so an accurate diagnosis is critical.},

By combining elements of the history with examination, the goal is to identify patterns and an effective differential diagnosis for this group of patients to help lead to an accurate diagnosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies over the past dozen years have changed the historical approach to patients with dizziness from one based primarily on how the patient describes the sensation of dizziness. This older approach can lead to misdiagnosis, so a preferred method puts greater emphasis on whether the dizziness is acute or chronic, episodic or continuous, or evoked by or brought on by an event or circumstance so that a pattern may be derived that better narrows the differential diagnosis and focused examination can further narrow to a cause or causes. SUMMARY: Dizziness is a common symptom of many possible causes. This article will help clinicians navigate gathering the history and examination to formulate a working diagnosis in patients affected by dizziness.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Important causes of unilateral and bilateral tinnitus are discussed, including those that are treatable or caused by serious structural or vascular causes. Concepts of hyperacusis and misophonia are covered, along with various types of neurologic disorders that can lead to pain in the ear. Hearing loss is common but not always purely otologic. SUMMARY: Tinnitus and hearing loss are common symptoms that are sometimes related to a primary neurologic disorder. This review, tailored to neurologists who care for patients who may be referred to or encountered in neurology practice, provides information on hearing disorders, how to recognize when a neurologic process may be involved, and when to refer to otolaryngology or other specialists.},

This article introduces readers to core concepts, as well as recent advances, in bedside and instrumented vestibular assessments. RECENT FINDINGS: Vestibular testing has improved immensely in the past 2 decades. While history and bedside testing is still the primary method of differential diagnosis in patients with dizziness, advances in technology such as the ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential test for superior canal dehiscence and the video head impulse test for vestibular neuritis have capabilities that go far beyond the bedside examination. Current vestibular testing now allows clinicians to test all five vestibular sensors in the inner ear. SUMMARY: Contemporary vestibular testing technology can now assess the entire vestibular periphery. Relatively subtle conditions, such as superior canal dehiscence or a subtle vestibular neuritis, can now be diagnosed with far greater certainty.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides a summary of the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with episodic positional dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS: Positional components are nearly ubiquitous among diagnoses of dizziness, so it can be challenging to classify patients with episodic positional dizziness simply based on the history of present illness. Overreliance on the presence of a report of positional components has likely resulted in misapplication or misinterpretation of positional testing and negative experiences with maneuvers to treat positional dizziness. The prototypical episodic positional dizziness disorder is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is caused by free-floating particles in a semicircular canal that move in response to gravity. The diagnosis is made by identifying the characteristic patterns of nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike test. Particle repositioning for BPPV is supported by randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and practice guidelines. Other disorders that can present with episodic positional dizziness are migraine dizziness, central lesions, and light cupula syndrome. SUMMARY: Episodic positional dizziness is a common presentation of dizziness. Neurologists should prioritize identifying and treating BPPV; doing so provides an important opportunity to deliver effective and efficient care. Providers should also recognize that positional components are common in most causes of dizziness and, therefore, should not over-rely on this part of the history of presentation when considering the diagnosis and management plan.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the numerous causes of vertigo and dizziness that are due to central nervous system (CNS) pathology and guides clinicians in formulating a differential diagnosis and treating patients with CNS causes of vertigo. RECENT FINDINGS: Specific autoimmune vestibulocerebellar syndromes may now be tested for, and this article discusses the antibodies known to cause such syndromes. Superficial siderosis can be more accurately diagnosed with imaging studies, and treatment using iron chelation has recently been studied but has not yet been established as an effective treatment. Central autonomic network damage in the brain can cause central orthostatic hypotension in some neurodegenerative diseases, and medication has been approved for treatment. SUMMARY: CNS causes of vertigo are numerous and important for clinicians to recognize. Examination findings are still an extremely valuable way to diagnose central vertigo; therefore, learning how to differentiate central from peripheral vertigo based on examination is an important skill. CNS causes of vertigo often have available treatments.},
