  abstract = {Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate golf swing performance in both preventing injury and injury occurrence. The objective of this review was to describe state-of-the-art golf swing biomechanics, with a specific emphasis on movement kinematics, and when possible, to suggest recommendations for research methodologies. Keywords related to biomechanics and golf swings were used in scientific databases. Only articles that focused on golf-swing kinematics were considered. In this review, 92 articles were considered and categorized into the following domains: X-factor, crunch factor, swing plane and clubhead trajectory, kinematic sequence, and joint angular kinematics. The main subjects of focus were male golfers. Performance parameters were searched for, but the lack of methodological consensus prevented generalization of the results and led to contradictory results. Currently, three-dimensional approaches are commonly used for joint angular kinematic investigations. However, recommendations by the International Society of Biomechanics are rarely considered.},

  abstract = {Golf is one of a few activities that people of all ages and skill level can play. Injury as with all sports can occur. The low back is the most common injury sustained whilst playing golf, and the dynamic action of the golf swing is a major contributing factor to injury. The golf swing is a complex movement that utilises the whole body in a coordinated fashion and when repeated frequently can result in injury. Injury can be overuse or traumatic in nature. Overuse injuries predominate in the professional golfer, and amateur golfer injury tends to occur secondary to an incorrect golf swing. Upper limb injuries are also common due to their role in linking the fast moving golf club with the power-generating torso. Fortunately, injury from a club or ball strike is rare. More common are the overuse injuries associated with the back, neck and shoulder. Most golf injury data have been collected retrospectively and further epidemiological study of a prospective nature is required to determine injury incidence and factor relating to the onset of injury.},

  abstract = {Golf is increasing in popularity with 24.8 million golfers in the U.S. in 2020, a 2\% increase from the previous year. This number increased to 37.5 million in 2021 which can be further broken down to 25.1 million on course and 12.4 million participating in off course activities. Playing golf does not come without risk of injury, with an annual incidence between 15.8\% and 40.9\% in amateurs and 31\% in professional golfers. Most injuries in golf occur due to overuse (82.6\%) and only a small percentage occur from a single traumatic event (17.4\%). Injuries most commonly occur at the low back followed by the wrist. Injury prevention programs have shown to be successful in other sports however to date there are no studies assessing a golfer's specific program. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to describe three individualized and unsupervised golf exercise programs (The Golfer's Fore, Fore+, and Advanced Fore+), of varying difficultly, designed to reduce the risk of injury, improve strength/mobility, and optimize performance. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.},

  abstract = {Increasing numbers of people are playing golf. Golf is a unique sport in that the ability to participate at a high level is not limited by age. In addition, participants tend to play more rather than less as they grow older. Injuries can occur at any point during the golf swing, from takeaway through follow-through. Upper extremity injuries can affect the hands, elbow, and shoulder and are usually a result of the golf swing at impact. Injuries are also common in the lower back as well as the lower extremities. Most injuries are the result of overuse and poor swing mechanics. When treating golfers, it is important to have a good understanding of the biomechanics and forces of the golf swing to diagnose and manage the vast spectrum of injuries incurred in this sport.},
