  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Selective Functional Movement Assessment (SFMA) is a functional movement assessment method to observe movement restrictions in individuals with known musculoskeletal disorders, although it has also been used to evaluate healthy athletes of different sports. AIM: The present paper aimed to evaluate the applicability of SFMA in a clinical setting and to verify whether a student can correctly perform it. METHODS: An introductory and explanatory email was sent to the subjects, containing the instructions needed to produce a video with SFMA evaluation movements. SFMA methodology was then used to analyze the received videos. The results between interobserver and intraobserver agreement were compared to the literature, considered the gold standard methods. RESULTS: Twenty-eight subjects (17.71 {\textpm} 1.96 years aged) were rated. The functional non-painful scenario (FN) has been assigned more frequently by all raters. The student's intra-rater reliability proved to be moderate (Kappa coefficient 0.49). Results for inter-rater reliability showed that the reliability degree between the senior physiotherapist and student before and after their educational path is good (Kappa coefficient 0.60 and 0.62, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed SFMA intra-rater reliability to be moderate, while inter-rater reliability can be considered good. These characteristics make it a valuable tool for sport's needs, even when used by students.},

  abstract = {To prepare an athlete for the wide variety of activities needed to participate in or return to their sport, the analysis of fundamental movements should be incorporated into screening in order to determine who possesses, or lacks, the ability to perform certain essential movements. In a series of two articles, the background and rationale for the analysis of fundamental movement will be provided. The Functional Movement Screen (FMS™) will be described, and any evidence related to its use will be presented. Three of the seven fundamental movement patterns that comprise the FMS™ are described in detail in Part I: the Deep Squat, Hurdle Step, and In-Line Lunge. Part II of this series which will be provided in the August issue of IJSPT, will provide a detailed description of the four additional patterns that complement those presented in Part I (to complete the seven total fundamental movements): Shoulder Mobility, the Active Straight Leg Raise, the Trunk Stability Push-up, and Rotary Stability, as well as a discussion about the utility of functional movement screening, and the future of functional movement. The intent of this two part series is to present the concepts associated with screening of fundamental movements, whether it is the FMS™ system or a different system devised by another clinician. Such a functional assessment should be incorporated into pre-participation screening and return to sport testing in order to determine whether the athlete has the essential movements needed to participate in sports activities at a level of minimum competency.

  abstract = {Part 1 of this two-part series (presented in the June issue of IJSPT) provided an introduction to functional movement screening, as well as the history, background, and a summary of the evidence regarding the reliability of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS™). Part 1 presented three of the seven fundamental movement patterns that comprise the FMS™, and the specific ordinal grading system from 0-3, used in the their scoring. Specifics for scoring each test are presented. Part 2 of this series provides a review of the concepts associated with the analysis of fundamental movement as a screening system for functional movement competency. In addition, the four remaining movements of the FMS™, which complement those described in Part 1, will be presented (to complete the total of seven fundamental movements): Shoulder Mobility, the Active Straight Leg Raise, the Trunk Stability Push-up, and Rotary Stability. The final four patterns are described in detail, and the specifics for scoring each test are presented, as well as the proposed clinical implications for receiving a grade less than a perfect "3". The intent of this two part series is to present the concepts associated with screening of fundamental movements, whether it is the FMS™ system or a different system devised by another clinician. Such a fundamental screen of the movement system should be incorporated into pre-participation screening and return to sport testing in order to determine whether an athlete has the essential movements needed to participate in sports activities at a level of minimum competency. Part 2 concludes with a discussion of the evidence related to functional movement screening, myths related to the FMS™, the future of functional movement screening, and the concept of movement as a system.
