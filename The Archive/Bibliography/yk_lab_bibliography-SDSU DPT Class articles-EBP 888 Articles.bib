  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and summarise the evidence for the effects of neuromuscular training compared with any other therapy (conventional training/sham) on knee proprioception following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. DESIGN: Systematic Review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, AMED, Scopus and Physical Education Index were searched from inception to February 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials investigating the effects of neuromuscular training on knee-specific proprioception tests following a unilateral ACL injury were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the eligible studies using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. Overall certainty in evidence was determined using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. RESULTS: Of 2706 articles retrieved, only 9 RCTs, comprising 327 individuals with an ACL reconstruction (ACLR), met the inclusion criteria. Neuromuscular training interventions varied across studies: whole body vibration therapy, Nintendo-Wii-Fit training, balance training, sport-specific exercises, backward walking, etc. Outcome measures included joint position sense (JPS; n=7), thresholds to detect passive motion (TTDPM; n=3) or quadriceps force control (QFC; n=1). Overall, between-group mean differences indicated inconsistent findings with an increase or decrease of errors associated with JPS by {$\leq$}2{$^\circ$}, TTDPM by {$\leq$}1.5{$^\circ$} and QFC by {$\leq$}6\,Nm in the ACLR knee following neuromuscular training. Owing to serious concerns with three or more GRADE domains (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness or imprecision associated with the findings) for each outcome of interest across studies, the certainty of evidence was very low. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of interventions, methodological limitations, inconsistency of effects (on JPS/TTDPM/QFC) preclude recommendation of one optimal neuromuscular training intervention for improving proprioception following ACL injury in clinical practice. There is a need for methodologically robust RCTs with homogenous populations with ACL injury (managed conservatively or with reconstruction), novel/well-designed neuromuscular training and valid proprioception assessments, which also seem to be lacking.

METHODS: Thirty male patients (mean age: 28.1 years) with ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) an experimental group to receive a KT treatment through the muscle and lymphatic correction techniques; or (2) a control group for sham KT. Both interventions were applied twice during a 10-day period from the fourth postoperative day. All patients received the same rehabilitation program for three months. The groups were compared according to range of motion (ROM), pain, swelling and muscle strength before treatment and on the fifth and tenth treatment days. Subjective evaluations were made with the Lysholm, modified Cincinnati and Tegner scores on the first and third postoperative months. RESULTS: Intragroup comparisons showed significant improvements in both groups on the fifth and tenth day and first and third month evaluations (p~{$<~$}0.05). In comparison to the control group, the experimental group showed significant improvements in swelling around the patella, all pain measurements and hamstring muscle strength on the fifth KT day and knee flexion range of motion (ROM), night pain, all swelling measurements and hamstring muscle strength on the tenth KT day (p~{$<~$}0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that KT techniques applied in addition to the acute rehabilitation program of ACL reconstruction are beneficial in treatment of pain, swelling, knee flexion ROM, and hamstring muscle strength.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Return-to-activity (RTA) assessments are commonly administered after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) to manage the patient's postoperative progressions back to activity. To date, few data are available on the clinical utility of these assessments to predict patient outcomes such as secondary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury once the athlete has returned to activity. OBJECTIVE: To identify the measures of patient function at 6 months post-ACLR that best predict RTA and second ACL injury at a minimum of 2 years after ACLR. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 patients with primary, unilateral ACLR completed functional assessments at approximately 6 months post-ACLR. Of these, 192 (82.1\%) completed follow-up at {$\geq$}2 years post-ACLR. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The 6-month functional assessments consisted of patient-reported outcomes, isokinetic knee-flexor and -extensor strength, and single-legged hopping. We collected RTA and secondary ACL injury data at {$\geq$}2 years after ACLR. RESULTS: Of the patients who were able to RTA (n = 155), 44 (28.4\%) had a subsequent ACL injury, 24 (15.5\%) to the ipsilateral graft ACL and 20 (12.9\%) to the contralateral ACL. A greater proportion of females had a secondary injury to the contralateral ACL (15/24, 62.5\%), whereas a greater proportion of males reinjured the ipsilateral ACL graft (15/20, 75.0\%; P = .017). Greater knee-extension symmetry at 6 months increased the probability of reinjury (B = 0.016, P = .048). Among patients with RTA at {$<$}8 months, every 1\% increase in quadriceps strength symmetry at 6 months increased the risk of reinjury by 2.1\% (B = 0.021, P = .05). Among patients with RTA at {$>$}8 months, every month that RTA was delayed reduced the risk of reinjury by 28.4\% (B = -0.284, P = .042). Descriptive statistics of patient function stratified between the early and delayed RTA groups can be found in the Supplemental Table (available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0407.20.S1). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with more symmetric quadriceps strength at 6 months post-ACLR were more likely to experience another ACL rupture, especially those who returned to sport at {$<$}8 months after the index surgery. Clinicians should be cognizant that returning high-functioning patients to activity at {$<$}8 months post-ACLR may place them at an increased risk for reinjury.},

Results indicated that compared to participants who received standard care, participants who received the multimedia program reported greater preoperative confidence in ability to cope, lower postoperative pain and kinesiophobia, and greater use and perceived utility of patient education materials.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation of soccer players after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is usually performed without sport-specific guidelines, and the final phases are often left to the team coaches. The possibility of changing this approach has not yet been investigated. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. HYPOTHESIS: A specific rehabilitation protocol for soccer players, with direct control of the last on-field rehabilitation phases, may lead to complete functional recovery. METHODS: Fifty competitive soccer players who followed a sport-specific rehabilitation protocol for soccer were evaluated during the recovery period until their return to competition. The assessment of the functional outcomes was performed using the Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale and isokinetic and aerobic fitness tests. RESULTS: The average start of on-field rehabilitation was 90 {\textpm} 26 days after surgery; the average time to return to the competitions was 185 {\textpm} 52 days. The improvement in the Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale during on-field rehabilitation was significant (P {$<$} 0.01; from 79 {\textpm} 15\% to 96 {\textpm} 7\%). The isokinetic and aerobic fitness tests showed a significant improvement of muscle strength (knee extensors, +55\%, P {$<$} 0.01; knee flexors, +86\%, P {$<$} 0.01) and aerobic threshold (+23\%, P {$<$} 0.01) from the beginning to the end of on-field rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Adding on-field rehabilitation to the traditional protocols after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may safely lead to complete functional recovery in soccer players.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the predictive value of return to sport (RTS) test batteries applied after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is limited. Adding assessment of psychological readiness has been recommended, but knowledge of how this affects the predictive ability of test batteries is lacking. PURPOSE: To examine the predictive ability of a RTS test battery on return to preinjury level of sport and reinjury when evaluation of psychological readiness was incorporated. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 129 patients were recruited 9 months after ACLR. Inclusion criteria were age {$\geq$}16\,years and engagement in sports before injury. Patients with concomitant ligamentous surgery or ACL revision surgery were excluded. Baseline testing included single-leg hop tests, isokinetic strength tests, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form 2000, a custom-made RTS questionnaire, and the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale. The RTS criteria were IKDC 2000 score {$\geq$}85\% and {$\geq$}85\% leg symmetry index on hop and strength test. At a 2-year follow-up evaluation, further knee surgery and reinjuries were registered and the RTS questionnaire was completed again. Regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to study the predictive ability of the test battery. RESULTS: Out of the 103 patients who completed the 2-year follow-up, 42\% returned to their preinjury level of sport. ACL-RSI 9 months after surgery (odds ratio [OR], 1.03) and age (OR, 1.05) predicted RTS. An ACL-RSI score {$<$}47 indicated that a patient was at risk of not returning to sport (area under the curve 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.58-0.79), with 85\% sensitivity and 45\% specificity. The functional tests did not predict RTS. Six patients sustained ACL reinjuries and 7 underwent surgery for other knee complaints/injuries after RTS testing. None of the 29 patients who passed all RTS criteria, and were therefore cleared for RTS, sustained a second knee injury. CONCLUSION: ACL-RSI and age were predictors of 2-year RTS, while functional tests were not informative. Another main finding was that none of the patients who passed the 85\% RTS criteria sustained another knee injury.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite the high costs of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries to patients and society, we are not aware of any systematic reviews that have been performed on patient-reported outcome instruments designed for this patient population. The purpose of the present review is to identify currently available patient-reported outcome questionnaires for patients with ACL injuries, to appraise and assess the methodological quality and psychometric evidence of the evaluations of identified instruments, and to summarize the overall evidence for each included questionnaire. Methods: A computerized literature search was performed to identify articles appropriate for inclusion in this systematic review. Search terms were related to outcome instruments, ACL injuries, and psychometric properties. Two independent reviewers assessed the suitability of articles for inclusion. The methodological quality of instrument evaluation was assessed with use of the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Psychometric properties were assessed with use of the quality criteria established by Terwee et al. The 2 assessments were synthesized to obtain an overall rating of the psychometric evidence for each questionnaire. Results: Forty-one studies investigating 24 instruments were included. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Form and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were the most frequently assessed instruments. The ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACLRSI) scale had 6 properties with positive evidence and was the highestquality instrument overall. Conclusions: Many of the included studies had low COSMIN ratings. The ACL-RSI is a reliable and valid scale to measure outcomes for patients with ACL injuries. Further assessments with improved methodological quality are needed to determine the psychometric properties of other instruments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The selection of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) is essential for obtaining meaningful information to treat a patient, determine a plan of care, and make clinical decisions; however, the process of selecting PROMs for clinical care is difficult, with the need to balance these multiple factors. Variation makes it difficult to compare data across providers and studies. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The purpose was to determine the responsiveness of 4 PROMs via effect size and the presence of a ceiling effect in the 5 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). We hypothesized that the single-item Global Rating Scale (GRS) would have an effect size and ceiling effect similar to the commonly used legacy PROMs. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Of the 300 participants, 218 had ACLR, completed postoperative progressive criterion-based rehabilitation early after surgery, and were followed for 5 years. We collected data based on the GRS, the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADLS), the International Knee Documentation Committee-Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF), and the KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) before and after training and at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months after ACLR. RESULTS: The IKDC-SKF had the largest effect sizes and lowest ceiling effects. The GRS had a similar size and change in both effect size and ceiling effect when compared with the longer PROMs. The GRS and IKDC-SKF had a correlation of 0.72, and the GRS had a minimal detectable change of 2.9 or 4.8, depending on methodology. CONCLUSION: The GRS responded similarly to the IKDC-SKF, KOS-ADLS, and KOOS and was responsive to patient change. The ease of use and patient-specific nature of the question means that it may be appropriate to use the GRS in clinical care as a consistent measure throughout the course of rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {Background:               Performance measures such as strength, jump height/length, and change of direction (CoD) time during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rehabilitation have been used to determine readiness to return to play and identify those who may be at risk of rerupture. However, athletes may reach these criteria despite ongoing biomechanical deficits when performing these tests. Combining return-to-play criteria with an assessment of movement through 3-dimensional (3D) biomechanics in male field sports athletes to identify risk factors for ACL rerupture has not been explored previously.                                         Purpose:               To prospectively examine differences in strength, jump, and CoD performance and movement using 3D biomechanics in a cohort of male athletes playing level 1 sports (ie, multidirectional field sports that involve landing, pivoting, or CoD) between those who reinjured the reconstructed ACL (RI group) and those with no reinjury (NRI group) after 2 years of follow-up and to examine the ability of these differences to predict reinjury.                                         Study Design:               Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.                                         Methods:               After primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR), 1045 male athletes were recruited and underwent testing 9 months after surgery including isokinetic strength, jump, and CoD performance measures as well as patient-reported outcomes and 3D biomechanical analyses. Participants were followed up after 2 years regarding ACL reinjury status. Differences were determined between the RI and NRI groups in patient-reported outcomes, performance measures, and 3D biomechanics on the ACLR side and symmetry between limbs. The ability of these measures to predict ACL reinjury was determined through logistic regression.                                         Results:               No differences were identified in strength and performance measures on the ACLR side or in symmetry. Biomechanical analysis indicated differences on the ACLR side primarily in the sagittal plane for the double-leg drop jump (effect size, 0.59-0.64) and greater asymmetry primarily in the frontal plane during unplanned CoD (effect size, 0.61-0.69) in the RI group. While these biomechanical test results were different between groups, multivariate regression modeling demonstrated limited ability (area under the curve, 0.67 and 0.75, respectively) to prospectively predict ACL reinjury.                                         Conclusion:               Commonly reported return-to-play strength, jump, and timed CoD performance measures did not differ between the RI and NRI groups. Differences in movement based on biomechanical measures during double-leg drop jump and unplanned CoD were identified, although they had limited ability to predict reinjury. Targeting these variables during rehabilitation may reduce reinjury risk in male athletes returning to level 1 sports after ACLR.

A total of 45 patients who underwent ACLR (28.76 {\textpm} 0.8 years; 34 males and 11 females) were retrospectively divided into three groups: control (CON, n = 15), NMES (n = 15), and BFR (n = 15). All participants carried out the RE program for 60 min, thrice a week for 12 weeks. The Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score, thigh circumference at 5 cm from the knee joint, Y-balance posterior medial, and lateral significantly increased in all groups via intervention (p {$<$} 0.05). However, NMES showed a higher thigh circumference at 15 cm from the knee joint than CON via intervention (p {$<$} 0.05), and the strength and endurance of quadriceps femoris and hamstrings and Y-balance anterior showed a significant increase via intervention in NMES and BFR compared with CON (p {$<$} 0.05). In conclusion, we confirmed that RE using NMES and BFR effectively enhances muscle function and balance in ACLR patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quadriceps strength testing is recommended to guide rehabilitation and mitigate the risk of second injury following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Hand-held dynamometry is a practical alternative to electromechanical dynamometry but demonstrates insufficient reliability and criterion validity in healthy and ACL-reconstructed participants respectively. The purpose of this study is to investigate the reliability and concurrent validity of inline dynamometry for measuring quadriceps strength. The hypotheses are that intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values will be {$>$}0.90 for reliability and concurrent validity. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study using a within-participant, repeated measures design. Isometric quadriceps testing was performed at 60{$^\circ$} knee flexion in 50 healthy and 52 ACL-reconstructed participants. Interrater reliability, intrarater reliability, and concurrent validity of inline dynamometry was investigated through calculation of ICCs, Bland-Altman analysis, linear regression, standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change (MDC). RESULTS: The lower bounds of the 95\% confidence intervals were {$>$}0.90 for all reliability and validity ICCs in healthy and ACL-reconstructed participants, except for intrarater reliability in healthy participants using absolute scores (ICC~=~0.936 [95\% CI 0.890-0.963]). In ACL-reconstructed participants, Bland-Altman bias was 0.01 Nm/kg for absolute and average scores, limits of agreement were -11.74\% to 12.59\% for absolute scores, the SEM was 0.13Nm/kg (95\% CI 0.10-0.17) and the MDC was 0.36Nm/kg (95\% CI 0.28 - 0.47). CONCLUSION: Inline dynamometry is a reliable and economical alternative to electromechanical dynamometry for the assessment of quadriceps strength following ACL-reconstruction.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To present the results of a return to sports bridge program designed to reduce knee injuries following ACL reconstruction and physical therapy. METHODS: One hundred and fifty (male\,=\,83, female\,=\,67) patients participated in a whole body neuromuscular control, progressive resistance strength and agility training program. Post-program testing included functional movement form, dynamic knee stability, lower extremity power, agility, and sports skill assessments. Participants completed the Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale (KOS-SAS) before and after program initiation. Pre-participation scores were re-estimated following program completion. RESULTS: Global rating KOS-SAS score at program entry was 75\,{\textpm}\,13. Post-program global rating and calculated KOS-SAS were 91.0\,{\textpm}\,9.8 and 90.9\,{\textpm}\,9.7, respectively (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Pre-participation KOS-SAS score re-estimates at program completion were 54.5\,{\textpm}\,23.3 and 57.3\,{\textpm}\,18.5, respectively. The approximately 20\% lower pre-program KOS-SAS score re-estimates (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) observed at program completion suggests that subjects had inaccurately high sports readiness perceptions at program entry. Perceived overall sports activity knee function ratings improved from 2.9\,{\textpm}\,0.6 (abnormal) at program entry to 1.3\,{\textpm}\,0.5 (normal) at completion (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Most subjects returned back to sports at or above their pre-injury performance skill/performance level (84\%, 126/150). By 6.8\,{\textpm}\,3.2~years (range\,=\,2-13~years) post-surgery, ten subjects had sustained an ipsilateral knee re-injury or contralateral knee injury (6.7\%). The 2.7\% non-contact contralateral and 1.3\% non-contact ipsilateral knee injury rates observed were significantly lower than those cited~in previous reports. CONCLUSION: Supplementing primary ACL reconstruction and standard physical therapy with a return to sports bridge program prior to release to unrestricted sports performance was effective at improving patient outcomes and decreasing ipsilateral knee re-injury and contralateral knee injury rates.
