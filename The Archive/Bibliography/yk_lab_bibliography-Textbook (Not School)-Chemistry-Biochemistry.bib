This paradigm is extended to biochemical principles and to myriad biomolecules. Biochemistry: An Organic Chemistry Approach provides a framework for understanding various topics of biochemistry, including the chemical behavior of biomolecules, enzyme activity, and more. It goes beyond mere memorization. Using several techniques to develop a relational understanding, including homework, this text helps students fully grasp and better correlate the essential organic chemistry concepts with those concepts at the root of biochemistry. The goal is to better understand the fundamental principles of biochemistry"--},
