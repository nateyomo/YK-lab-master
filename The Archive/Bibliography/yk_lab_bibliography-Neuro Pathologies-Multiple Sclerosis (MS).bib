  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience deficits in motor and cognitive domains, resulting in impairment in dual-task walking ability. The goal of this study was to compare performance of forward walking and backward walking in single- and dual-task conditions in persons with MS to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We also examined relationships between forward and backward walking to cognitive function, balance, and retrospective fall reports. METHODS: All measures were collected in a single session. A 2 {\texttimes} 2 {\texttimes} 2 mixed model ANOVA was used to compare differences in forward and backward walking in single- and dual-task conditions between MS and healthy controls. Spearman correlations were used to examine relationships between gait and cognitive function, falls, and balance. RESULTS: Eighteen individuals with relapsing-remitting MS and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy controls participated. Backward walking velocity revealed significant differences between groups for both single-task (p = 0.015) and dual-task (p = 0.014) conditions. Persons with MS demonstrated significant differences between single- and dual-task forward and backward walking velocities (p = 0.023; p = 0.004), whereas this difference was only apparent in the backward walking condition for healthy controls (p = 0.004). In persons with MS, there were significant differences in double support time between single- and dual-task conditions in both backward (p {$<$} 0.001) and forward (p = 0.001) directions. More falls at six months were significantly associated with shorter backward dual-task stride length (r = -0.490; p = 0.046) and slower velocity (r = -0.483; p = 0.050). CONCLUSION: Differences in MS and age- and sex-matched healthy controls are more pronounced during backward compared to forward walking under single- and dual-task conditions. Future work with a larger sample size is needed to validate the clinical utility of backward walking and dual-task assessments and mitigate the limited sensitivity of the current dual-task assessments that primarily rely upon forward walking.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with multiple sclerosis experience deficits in mobility resulting in injurious falls. Fall detection has proved challenging; the majority of clinical measures rely on forward walking and balance measures, yet these measures have poor sensitivity and predictive value for differentiating between fallers and non-fallers. Backward walking better differentiates fallers from non-fallers in the elderly and other neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, the objective of this study was to examine both forward and backward walking to determine the strongest, unique contributor that differentiates fallers from non-fallers in persons with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: In a single session, spatiotemporal measures of forward and backward walking and fall history were collected. For the subsequent six months, individuals recorded falls in a fall diary. Discriminant function analysis was used to determine what variables most strongly and uniquely differentiate multiple sclerosis fallers from non-fallers. RESULTS: Thirty-eight individuals with multiple sclerosis participated. Forward and backward velocity, stride length, and double support time as well as age, disease severity, and symptom duration were included in the models. Together, the variables differentiated between fallers and non-fallers (Wilk's lambda {$\chi$}2 (8, N~=~36)~=~0.497, p{$<$}0.001) and in rank order, backward walking velocity was the strongest unique predictor. Repeating the analysis with a stepwise approach yielded that backward walking velocity in the first step ({$\chi$}2 (1, 34)~=~0.68, F~=~15.96, p{$<$}0.001) and symptom duration in the second step ({$\chi$}2~=~0.59, F (2, 33)~=~11.46; p{$<$}0.001) most strongly differentiated retrospective fallers and non-fallers. This stepwise model with backward walking velocity and symptom duration accurately classified 76.3\% of cases. Addition of forward walking measures did not significantly improve the models, and indeed the accuracy of classification was reduced to 71.1\%. Exploratory analysis showed that backward walking velocity was the best predictor of prospectively reported fallers and non-fallers ({$\chi$}2 (1, 7)~=~0.43, F~=~9.20, p~=~0.02). CONCLUSION: Backward walking velocity exhibits the highest effect magnitude and specificity in differentiating fallers from non-fallers in individuals with MS and demonstrates potential as clinically feasible and efficient fall detection tool.},
