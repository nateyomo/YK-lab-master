  abstract = {Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressive disease that affects 1 in 3600-6000 live male births. Although guidelines are available for various aspects of DMD, comprehensive clinical care recommendations do not exist. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention selected 84 clinicians to develop care recommendations using the RAND Corporation-University of California Los Angeles Appropriateness Method. The DMD Care Considerations Working Group evaluated assessments and interventions used in the management of diagnostics, gastroenterology and nutrition, rehabilitation, and neuromuscular, psychosocial, cardiovascular, respiratory, orthopaedic, and surgical aspects of DMD. These recommendations, presented in two parts, are intended for the wide range of practitioners who care for individuals with DMD. They provide a framework for recognising the multisystem primary manifestations and secondary complications of DMD and for providing coordinated multidisciplinary care. In part 1 of this Review, we describe the methods used to generate the recommendations, and the overall perspective on care, pharmacological treatment, and psychosocial management.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical training might delay the functional deterioration caused by disuse in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The "No Use Is Disuse" study is the first explorative, randomized controlled trial in boys with DMD to examine whether assisted bicycle training is feasible, safe, and beneficial. METHODS: Ambulatory and recently wheelchair-dependent boys with DMD were allocated to the intervention or control group. The intervention group received assisted bicycle training of the legs and arms during 24 weeks. The control group received the same training after a waiting period of 24 weeks. The primary study outcomes were the Motor Function Measure (MFM) and the Assisted 6-Minute Cycling Test (A6MCT). Group differences were examined by an analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Thirty boys (mean age 10.5 {\textpm} 2.6 years, 18 ambulant and 12 wheelchair-dependent) were allocated to the intervention (n = 17) or the control (n = 13) group. All boys in the intervention group (except one) completed the training. After 24 weeks, the total MFM score remained stable in the intervention group, whereas it had significantly decreased in the control group ({$\Delta$} = 4.9, 95\% confidence interval = 2.2-7.6). No significant group differences were found for the A6MCT. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that assisted bicycle training of the legs and arms is feasible and safe for both ambulant and wheelchair-dependent children and may decline the deterioration due to disuse. Progressive deterioration, however, may compromise the design of trials for DMD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This two-part study explored the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a mild-moderate resistance isometric leg exercise program in ambulatory boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). METHODS: First, we used a dose escalation paradigm with varying intensity and frequency of leg isometric exercise to determine the dose response and safety in 10 boys. Second, we examined safety and feasibility of a 12-wk in-home, remotely supervised, mild-moderate intensity strengthening program in eight boys. Safety measures included T2 MRI, creatine kinase levels, and pain. Peak strength and function (time to ascend/descend four stairs) were also measured. RESULTS: Dose-escalation revealed no signs of muscle damage. Seven of the eight boys completed the 12-wk in-home program with a compliance of 84.9\%, no signs of muscle damage, and improvements in strength (knee extensors P\,{$<$}\,.01; knee flexors P\,{$<$}\,.05) and function (descending steps P\,{$<$}\,.05). CONCLUSIONS: An in-home, mild-moderate intensity leg exercise program is safe with potential to positively impact both strength and function in ambulatory boys with DMD.},

  abstract = {A large and complex gene on the X chromosome encodes dystrophin. Many mutations have been described in this gene, most of which affect the expression of the muscle isoform, the best-known protein product of this locus. These mutations result in the Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD and BMD). However, there are several other tissue specific isoforms of dystrophin, some exclusively or predominantly expressed in the brain or the retina. Mutations affecting the correct expression of these tissue-specific isoforms have been associated with the CNS involvement common in DMD. Rare mutations also account for the allelic disorder X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy, in which dystrophin expression or function is affected mostly or exclusively in the heart. Genotype definition of the dystrophin gene in patients with dystrophinopathies has taught us much about functionally important domains of the protein itself and has provided insights into several regulatory mechanisms governing the gene expression profile. Here, we focus on current understanding of the genotype-phenotype relation for mutations in the dystrophin gene and their implications for gene functions.},
