  abstract = {Respiratory function has become a global health priority. Not only is chronic respiratory disease a leading cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality, but the COVID-19 pandemic has~heightened attention on respiratory health and the means of enhancing it. Subsequently, and inevitably, the respiratory system has become a target of the multi-trillion-dollar health and wellness industry. Numerous commercial, respiratory-related interventions are now coupled to therapeutic and/or ergogenic claims that vary in their plausibility: from the reasonable to the absurd. Moreover, legitimate and illegitimate claims are often conflated in a wellness space that lacks regulation. The abundance of interventions, the range of potential therapeutic targets in the respiratory system, and the wealth of research that varies in quality, all confound the ability for health and exercise professionals to make informed risk-to-benefit assessments with their patients and clients. This review focuses on numerous commercial interventions that purport to improve respiratory health, including nasal dilators, nasal breathing, and systematized breathing interventions (such as pursed-lips breathing), respiratory muscle training, canned oxygen, nutritional supplements, and inhaled L-menthol. For each intervention we describe the premise, examine the plausibility, and systematically contrast commercial claims against the published literature. The overarching aim is to assist health and exercise professionals to distinguish science from pseudoscience and make pragmatic and safe risk-to-benefit decisions.},

  abstract = {We investigated whether, during maximal exercise, intercostal muscle blood flow is as high as during resting hyperpnoea at the same work of breathing. We hypothesized that during exercise, intercostal muscle blood flow would be limited by competition from the locomotor muscles. Intercostal (probe over the 7th intercostal space) and vastus lateralis muscle perfusion were measured simultaneously in ten trained cyclists by near-infrared spectroscopy using indocyanine green dye. Measurements were made at several exercise intensities up to maximal (WRmax) and subsequently during resting isocapnic hyperpnoea at minute ventilation levels up to those at WRmax. During resting hyperpnoea, intercostal muscle blood flow increased linearly with the work of breathing (R2 = 0.94) to 73.0 +/- 8.8 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 at the ventilation seen at WRmax (work of breathing approximately 550-600 J min-1), but during exercise it peaked at 80\% WRmax (53.4 +/- 10.3 ml min-1 (100 g)-1), significantly falling to 24.7 +/- 5.3 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 at WRmax. At maximal ventilation intercostal muscle vascular conductance was significantly lower during exercise (0.22 +/- 0.05 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 mmHg-1) compared to isocapnic hyperpnoea (0.77 +/- 0.13 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 mmHg-1). During exercise, both cardiac output and vastus lateralis muscle blood flow also plateaued at about 80\% WRmax (the latter at 95.4 +/- 11.8 ml min-1 (100 g)-1). In conclusion, during exercise above 80\% WRmax in trained subjects, intercostal muscle blood flow and vascular conductance are less than during resting hyperpnoea at the same minute ventilation. This suggests that the circulatory system is unable to meet the demands of both locomotor and intercostal muscles during heavy exercise, requiring greater O2 extraction and likely contributing to respiratory muscle fatigue.},

  abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? The work presented here focuses mostly on testing the theory of blood flow redistribution from the locomotor to the respiratory muscles during heavy exercise in healthy participants and in patients with COPD. What advances does it highlight? Studies presented and the direct experimental approach to measure muscle blood flow by indocyanine green dye detected by near infrared spectroscopy, show that exercise interferes with respiratory muscle blood flow especially in COPD, but even in healthy. ABSTRACT: We have developed an indicator-dilution method to measure muscle blood flow at rest and during exercise using the light absorbing tracer indocyanine green dye (ICG) injected as an intravenous bolus, with surface optodes placed over muscles of interest to record the ICG signal by near-infrared spectroscopy. Here we review findings for both quadriceps and intercostal muscle blood flow (measured simultaneously) in trained cyclists and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). During resting hyperpnoea in both athletes and patients, intercostal muscle blood flow increased with ventilation, correlating closely and linearly with the work of breathing, with no change in quadriceps flow. During graded exercise in athletes, intercostal flow at first increased, but then began to fall approaching peak effort. Unexpectedly, in COPD, intercostal muscle blood flow during exercise fell progressively from resting values, contrasting sharply with the response to resting hyperpnoea. During exercise at peak intensity, we found no quadriceps blood flow reduction in favour of the respiratory muscles in either athletes or patients. In COPD at peak exercise, when patients breathed 21\% oxygen in helium or 100\% oxygen, there was no redistribution of blood flow observed between legs and respiratory muscles in either direction. Evidence of decrease in leg blood flow and increase in respiratory muscle flow was found only when imposing expiratory flow limitation (EFL) during exercise in healthy individuals. However, because EFL caused substantial physiological derangement, lowering arterial oxygen saturation and raising end-tidal PCO2 and heart rate, these results cannot be projected onto normal exercise.},
