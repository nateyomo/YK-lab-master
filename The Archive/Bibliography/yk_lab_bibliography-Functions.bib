  abstract = {This systematic review aims to reveal the effectiveness of proprioceptive exercise combined with dual-task training in stroke patients. The research was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to evaluate studies of rehabilitation interventions with proprioceptive and dual-task exercises in patients with stroke. The keywords for the search were: "stroke" AND "proprioception" OR "proprioceptive" AND "rehabilitation" OR "training" OR "exercises" AND "dual-task" OR "task-performance" with the following inclusion criteria: comparative studies of rehabilitation interventions with proprioceptive and dual-task exercises in stroke patients. Of the 104,014 studies identified, 23 were included according to the inclusion criteria. Proprioceptive and dual-task exercises stimulate and promote postural balance, gait, and quality of life and reduce the risk of falls in stroke patients compared with traditional rehabilitation programs. In conclusion, this systematic review suggests that proprioceptive exercise combined with dual-task training is needed to improve balance and recover gait. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on the various proprioceptive treatments with contextual dual-task exercises for imbalance after stroke, providing a guide for choosing a complete rehabilitation protocol that combines these two techniques.},

  abstract = {The modified Brostr{\"o}m procedure (MBP) is an initial treatment for symptomatic chronic ankle instability (CAI) patients. This study aimed to compare the proprioception and neuromuscular control ability of both affected and unaffected ankles at the time of return to sports after MBP for patients with scores of normal controls. 75 individuals (40 who underwent MBP, 35 normal controls) participated. The dynamic balance test scores were significantly higher in the affected ankle of the patients than in the controls (1.5\,{\textpm}\,0.6{$^\circ$} vs. 1.1\,{\textpm}\,0.4{$^\circ$}, p\,{$<$}\,0.003). The time to peak torque for dorsiflexion (60.8\,{\textpm}\,13.9~ms vs. 52.2\,{\textpm}\,17.5~ms, p\,{$<$}\,0.022) and eversion (68.9\,{\textpm}\,19.1~ms vs. 59.3\,{\textpm}\,21.1~ms, p\,{$<$}\,0.043) was significantly delayed in the affected ankle of the patients than in the controls. The dynamic balance test and time to peak torque in CAI patients remained significantly reduced at the time of return-to-sport after MBP. Clinicians and therapists should be aware of potential deficits in proprioception and neuromuscular control when determining the timing of return to sports after MBP.},

The necessarily curvilinear relationship between the finite range of recorded FIM raw scores and the conceptually infinite range of additive disability measures is resolved through Rasch analysis. The analysis of admission and discharge FIM ratings of 14,799 patients shows that the 18 FIM items define two statistically and clinically different indicators. Thirteen items define disability in motor functions. Five items define disability in cognitive functions. Additive measures for each indicator have the same characteristics at admission and discharge, so that these measures can be used to assess change in patient status.},

  abstract = {The prevention of falls among the elderly is arguably one of the most important public health issues in today's aging society. The aim of this study was to assess which tools best predict the risk of falls in the elderly. Electronic searches were performed using Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, etc., using the following keywords: "fall risk assessment", "elderly fall screening", and "elderly mobility scale". The QUADAS-2 was applied to assess the internal validity of the diagnostic studies. Selected studies were meta-analyzed with MetaDisc 1.4. A total of 33 studies were eligible out of the 2,321 studies retrieved from selected databases. Twenty-six assessment tools for fall risk were used in the selected articles, and they tended to vary based on the setting. The fall risk assessment tools currently used for the elderly did not show sufficiently high predictive validity for differentiating high and low fall risks. The Berg Balance scale and Mobility Interaction Fall chart showed stable and high specificity, while the Downton Fall Risk Index, Hendrich II Fall Risk Model, St. Thomas's Risk Assessment Tool in Falling elderly inpatients, Timed Up and Go test, and Tinetti Balance scale showed the opposite results. We concluded that rather than a single measure, two assessment tools used together would better evaluate the characteristics of falls by the elderly that can occur due to a multitude of factors and maximize the advantages of each for predicting the occurrence of falls.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study investigates the reproducibility and concurrent validity of the Rate of Perceived Stability (RPS) Scale in people with stroke. METHODS: On two separate days (2-10\,days apart), participants provided their RPS ratings during clinical measures: 1)16 tasks from Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CB\&M), 2)6-minute walk test (6MWT), and 3)self-paced gait speed. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) assessed between day test-retest reliability of RPS ratings. Standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest detectable change (SDC) addressed level of between day agreement. Spearman rank correlations (rs) quantified relationships between RPS, and general rating of perceived challenge, task-performance scores. RESULTS: Thirty participants with stroke (50\% female) participated. ICC ranged from 0.46 to 0.93 across tasks with 12/19 tasks showing ICCs above 0.75 (good test-retest reliability). SEM was 1-point for each task and SDC ranged from 2 to 4 across tasks. Concurrent validity between RPS and ratings of perceived challenge was good-to-excellent (rs ranged 0.78-0.94, p\,{$<$}\,0.01). Higher RPS (indicative of feeling less stable) was associated with lower balance performance scores on CB\&M tasks, negative relationships ranged in strength from fair to good-to-excellent in 10/16 tasks (rs ranged -0.46 to -0.81, p\,{$\leq$}\,0.01). CONCLUSIONS: RPS shows promise as a measure of balance intensity in people with stroke.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe RPS is a reliable and valid measure of balance intensity in ambulatory people with stroke.The RPS scale may be a useful clinical tool to address the gap in practice of measuring balance intensity during rehabilitation of walking balance post-stroke.},
