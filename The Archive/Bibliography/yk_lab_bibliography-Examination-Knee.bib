  abstract = {A plica is a band of thick, fibrotic tissue that extends from the synovial capsule of a joint. Plica can be present in multiple joints, but this article will review plica in the knee which is the joint most commonly affected by plica tissue. As a result of overuse or injury, plica can become inflamed or irritated due to friction across the patella or the medial femoral condyle. When the plica becomes inflamed or irritated, it can cause plica syndrome, which is anterior knee pain due to the plica.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To identify, analyze, and synthesize the literature to determine which physical examination tests, if any, accurately diagnose a torn tibial meniscus. BACKGROUND: Knee pain has a lifetime prevalence of up to 45\%, and as many as 31\% of individuals with knee pain will consult a general practitioner. Roughly 5\% of these individuals will undergo a tibial meniscectomy and many more will undergo partial meniscectomy or meniscus repair. Determining which of these individuals is appropriate for surgical consult depends on clinical examination findings. METHODS AND MEASURES: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus from1966 to August 2006 and extracted all English- and German-language studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of individual physical examination tests for a torn meniscus. We retrieved data regarding true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives to create 2-by-2 tables for each article and test. Like tests were then subjected to meta-analysis and subanalysis. Cochran Q test and the 12 statistic were used to examine for the presence of heterogeneity and the extent of the effect of heterogeneity, respectively. A qualitative analysis was also performed using the QUADAS tool. RESULTS: Eighteen studies qualified for the final analyses. Three physical examination tests (McMurray's, Apley's, and joint line tenderness) were examined in more than 7 studies and had enough data to consider meta-analysis. However, study results were heterogeneous. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 70\% and 71\% for McMurray's, 60\% and 70\% for Apley's, and 63\% and 77\% for joint line tenderness. Large between-study differences could not be explained by prevalence, study quality, or how well an index test was described. CONCLUSIONS: No single physical examination test appears to accurately diagnose a torn tibial meniscus and the value of history plus physical examination is unknown. Differences between studies in diagnostic performance remain unexplained, presumably due to local differences in the way the tests are defined, performed, and interpreted. We recommend a more standardized approach to performing and interpreting these tests and the development of a clinical prediction rule to aid clinicians in the diagnosis of a torn tibial meniscus.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the accuracy of the McMurray test in the adolescent and pediatric population. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Tertiary care, institutional. PATIENTS: Inclusion criteria included patients who presented with unilateral knee pain and were seen by pediatric sports medicine physicians. Patients were excluded if their knee pain was related to any underlying conditions. Three hundred patient charts were reviewed, and 183 patients (age range: 8-18 years, mean: 14 years; 74 male) met the inclusion criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Symptoms at initial visit (knee pain). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of a meniscal tear using the McMurray test. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent (160/191) of patients had a McMurray test documented as performed by the physician, and 17\% (27/160) elucidated a positive response. Of 26 patients who had a positive McMurray and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 16 (62\%) showed a meniscal tear on their MRI. However, of the 87 patients who had a negative McMurray and still underwent MRI, 25 (29\%) had a positive meniscal tear. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 39\%, 86\%, 62\%, and 71\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In a pediatric and adolescent population, the McMurray test was negative for 61\% (23/38) of meniscal tears identified on MRI. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although the test can be a useful tool as a part of a thorough evaluation, combining it with mechanical symptoms, patient history and imaging may be more helpful to diagnose a meniscus tear.},
