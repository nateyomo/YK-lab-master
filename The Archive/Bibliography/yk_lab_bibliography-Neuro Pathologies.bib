  abstract = {The causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease are unknown. Furthermore, treatment for two of these conditions is almost totally lacking. The thesis is presented that each of these disorders is due to lack of a disorder-specific neurotrophic hormone. The hormone would be elaborated or stored in the target of the affected neurons. It would be released by the postsynaptic cell and then exert its effects in a retrograde fashion after being taken up by the presynaptic terminal. In the lower motor neuron syndromes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, failure of muscle cells to release the appropriate motor neurotrophic hormone would result in impaired function of anterior horn cells. In Parkinson disease, the neurotrophic failure would be characterized by inability of striatal cells to provide the required dopamine neurotrophic hormone with resulting impairment of substantia nigra cells. In Alzheimer disease, the abnormalities would lie in failure of the hippocampus and cortical cells to supply the relevant cholinergic neurotrophic hormone with resulting impairment of medial septal and nucleus basalis neurons. Central nervous system tissue culture provides a convenient system in which to assay these neurotrophic hormones and should permit a test of the hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Unilateral stroke can lead to a disorder of postural balance that manifests as a pushing away toward the contralesional side. It is called "pusher syndrome" (PS). The aims of this study were first to assess the anatomical cortical regions that induce PS and second to clarify whether tilt of the subjective visual vertical (SVV)--a sign of vestibular otolith dysfunction--is associated with PS. Sixty-six patients with acute unilateral strokes (28 left-sided lesions, 38 right-sided lesions) were tested for PS, for tilts of the SVV, for hemineglect and for the anatomical lesion site by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based voxelwise lesion-behavior mapping analysis. Our data indicated no significant voxels; however, there was a trend towards an association between lesions of the posterior part of the insula, the operculum and the superior temporal gyrus--key areas of the multisensory vestibular cortical network--and the extent of pushing in patients with right-sided lesions, whereas the rather anterior part of the insula, the operculum as well as the internal capsule reaching to the lateral thalamus seemed to be involved in PS in left-sided lesion patients. These data might point toward a link between the systems responsible for postural control and for processing vestibular otolith information. These findings indicate that vestibular information might be fundamental in right-sided lesion patients for maintaining body posture in space.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is one of the most significant healthcare problems nationally and globally. Recently, the first description of the reversal of cognitive decline in patients with early Alzheimer's disease or its precursors, MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and SCI (subjective cognitive impairment), was published [1]. The therapeutic approach used was programmatic and personalized rather than monotherapeutic and invariant, and was dubbed metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND). Patients who had had to discontinue work were able to return to work, and those struggling at work were able to improve their performance. The patients, their spouses, and their co-workers all reported clear improvements. Here we report the results from quantitative MRI and neuropsychological testing in ten patients with cognitive decline, nine ApoE4+ (five homozygous and four heterozygous) and one ApoE4-, who were treated with the MEND protocol for 5-24 months. The magnitude of the improvement is unprecedented, providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective. These results have far-reaching implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, MCI, and SCI; for personalized programs that may enhance pharmaceutical efficacy; and for personal identification of ApoE genotype.},

  abstract = {Progression markers of Parkinson's disease are crucial for successful therapeutic development. Recently, a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging analysis technique using a bitensor model was introduced allowing the estimation of the fractional volume of free water within a voxel, which is expected to increase in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Prior work demonstrated that free water in the posterior substantia nigra was elevated in Parkinson's disease compared to controls across single- and multi-site cohorts, and increased over 1 year in Parkinson's disease but not in controls at a single site. Here, the goal was to validate free water in the posterior substantia nigra as a progression marker in Parkinson's disease, and describe the pattern of progression of free water in patients with a 4-year follow-up tested in a multicentre international longitudinal study of de novo Parkinson's disease (http://www.ppmi-info.org/). The analyses examined: (i) 1-year changes in free water in 103 de novo patients with Parkinson's disease and 49 controls; (ii) 2- and 4-year changes in free water in a subset of 46 patients with Parkinson's disease imaged at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 months; (iii) whether 1- and 2-year changes in free water predict 4-year changes in the Hoehn and Yahr scale; and (iv) the relationship between 4-year changes in free water and striatal binding ratio in a subgroup of Parkinson's disease who had undergone both diffusion and dopamine transporter imaging. Results demonstrated that: (i) free water level in the posterior substantia nigra increased over 1 year in de novo Parkinson's disease but not in controls; (ii) free water kept increasing over 4 years in Parkinson's disease; (iii) sex and baseline free water predicted 4-year changes in free water; (iv) free water increases over 1 and 2 years were related to worsening on the Hoehn and Yahr scale over 4 years; and (v) the 4-year increase in free water was associated with the 4-year decrease in striatal binding ratio in the putamen. Importantly, all longitudinal results were consistent across sites. In summary, this study demonstrates an increase over 1 year in free water in the posterior substantia nigra in a large cohort of de novo patients with Parkinson's disease from a multi-site cohort study and no change in healthy controls, and further demonstrates an increase of free water in Parkinson's disease over the course of 4 years. A key finding was that results are consistent across sites and the 1-year and 2-year increase in free water in the posterior substantia nigra predicts subsequent long-term progression on the Hoehn and Yahr staging system. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that free water in the posterior substantia nigra is a valid, progression imaging marker of Parkinson's disease, which may be used in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies.},

DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted in an outpatient rehabilitation hospital concussion clinic and consisted of adults undergoing a neuropsychological evaluation. Cronbach {$\alpha$} assessed internal consistency for Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores. Pearson r correlation coefficients assessed construct validity among emotional function measures and Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores at initial evaluation. Hierarchical regression models were used to assess criterion validity. RESULTS: Excellent internal consistency was observed for Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores ({$\alpha$} = 0.953). The Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale was significantly correlated with cause of injury ( r = -0.223, P {$<$} 0.01), litigation consideration ( r = 0.309, P {$<$} 0.05), and history of psychiatric illness ( r = 0.198, P {$<$} 0.01). The Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale was significantly correlated with emotional functioning (Patient Health Questionnaire [ r = 0.600, P {$<$} 0.05]; Generalized Anxiety Disorder [ r = 0.602, P {$<$} 0.05]), symptom rating (Sports Concussion Assessment Tool [Fifth Edition, r = 0.477, P {$<$} 0.05]), and cognitive functioning (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status [ r = -0.238, P {$<$} 0.05]) measures. The final regression model explained 64.7\% variance in Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores and included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( b = 1.038, {$\beta$} = 0.466, P = 0.001) as a unique predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate strong, positive relationships between anxiety and catastrophizing at initial neuropsychological evaluation in a postconcussion sample.},

Proprioceptive and dual-task exercises stimulate and promote postural balance, gait, and quality of life and reduce the risk of falls in stroke patients compared with traditional rehabilitation programs. In conclusion, this systematic review suggests that proprioceptive exercise combined with dual-task training is needed to improve balance and recover gait. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on the various proprioceptive treatments with contextual dual-task exercises for imbalance after stroke, providing a guide for choosing a complete rehabilitation protocol that combines these two techniques.},

Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome have been linked to GBA dysfunction, central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, and dopaminergic degeneration, as those occurring in Parkinson's disease (PD). Besides inflammation, the activation of brain microglia is known to play a central role in the damage of dopaminergic neurons. Inflammation is attributed to the toxic effect of aggregated {$\alpha$}-synuclein, in the brain of PD patients. It has been suggested that the {$\alpha$}-synuclein misfolding might begin in the gut and spread "prion-like", via the vagus nerve into the lower brainstem and ultimately to the midbrain, known as the Braak hypothesis. In this review, we discuss how the microbiota-gut-brain axis and environmental influences interact with the immune system to promote a pro-inflammatory state that is involved in the initiation and progression of misfolded {$\alpha$}-synuclein proteins and the beginning of the early non-motor symptoms of PD. Furthermore, we describe a speculative bidirectional model that explains how the enteric glia is involved in the initiation and spreading of inflammation, epithelial barrier disruption, and {$\alpha$}-synuclein misfolding, finally reaching the central nervous system and contributing to neuroinflammatory processes involved with the initial non-motor symptoms of PD.},

Examples of underlying neural circuits include salience, multimodal integration, and attention networks. The symptoms of each patient can be described as a combination of dysfunction in several of these networks and related processes. While we have gained a considerable understanding of FND, there is more work to be done, including determining how pathophysiological abnormalities arise as a consequence of etiologic biopsychosocial factors. To facilitate advances in this underserved and important area, we propose a pathophysiology-focused research agenda to engage government-sponsored funding agencies and foundations.},

The goal of this study was to compare performance of forward walking and backward walking in single- and dual-task conditions in persons with MS to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We also examined relationships between forward and backward walking to cognitive function, balance, and retrospective fall reports. METHODS: All measures were collected in a single session. A 2 {\texttimes} 2 {\texttimes} 2 mixed model ANOVA was used to compare differences in forward and backward walking in single- and dual-task conditions between MS and healthy controls. Spearman correlations were used to examine relationships between gait and cognitive function, falls, and balance. RESULTS: Eighteen individuals with relapsing-remitting MS and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy controls participated. Backward walking velocity revealed significant differences between groups for both single-task (p = 0.015) and dual-task (p = 0.014) conditions. Persons with MS demonstrated significant differences between single- and dual-task forward and backward walking velocities (p = 0.023; p = 0.004), whereas this difference was only apparent in the backward walking condition for healthy controls (p = 0.004). In persons with MS, there were significant differences in double support time between single- and dual-task conditions in both backward (p {$<$} 0.001) and forward (p = 0.001) directions. More falls at six months were significantly associated with shorter backward dual-task stride length (r = -0.490; p = 0.046) and slower velocity (r = -0.483; p = 0.050). CONCLUSION: Differences in MS and age- and sex-matched healthy controls are more pronounced during backward compared to forward walking under single- and dual-task conditions. Future work with a larger sample size is needed to validate the clinical utility of backward walking and dual-task assessments and mitigate the limited sensitivity of the current dual-task assessments that primarily rely upon forward walking.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with multiple sclerosis experience deficits in mobility resulting in injurious falls. Fall detection has proved challenging; the majority of clinical measures rely on forward walking and balance measures, yet these measures have poor sensitivity and predictive value for differentiating between fallers and non-fallers. Backward walking better differentiates fallers from non-fallers in the elderly and other neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, the objective of this study was to examine both forward and backward walking to determine the strongest, unique contributor that differentiates fallers from non-fallers in persons with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: In a single session, spatiotemporal measures of forward and backward walking and fall history were collected. For the subsequent six months, individuals recorded falls in a fall diary. Discriminant function analysis was used to determine what variables most strongly and uniquely differentiate multiple sclerosis fallers from non-fallers. RESULTS: Thirty-eight individuals with multiple sclerosis participated. Forward and backward velocity, stride length, and double support time as well as age, disease severity, and symptom duration were included in the models. Together, the variables differentiated between fallers and non-fallers (Wilk's lambda {$\chi$}2 (8, N~=~36)~=~0.497, p{$<$}0.001) and in rank order, backward walking velocity was the strongest unique predictor. Repeating the analysis with a stepwise approach yielded that backward walking velocity in the first step ({$\chi$}2 (1, 34)~=~0.68, F~=~15.96, p{$<$}0.001) and symptom duration in the second step ({$\chi$}2~=~0.59, F (2, 33)~=~11.46; p{$<$}0.001) most strongly differentiated retrospective fallers and non-fallers. This stepwise model with backward walking velocity and symptom duration accurately classified 76.3\% of cases. Addition of forward walking measures did not significantly improve the models, and indeed the accuracy of classification was reduced to 71.1\%. Exploratory analysis showed that backward walking velocity was the best predictor of prospectively reported fallers and non-fallers ({$\chi$}2 (1, 7)~=~0.43, F~=~9.20, p~=~0.02). CONCLUSION: Backward walking velocity exhibits the highest effect magnitude and specificity in differentiating fallers from non-fallers in individuals with MS and demonstrates potential as clinically feasible and efficient fall detection tool.},

METHODS: Medical literature was queried for all reports of this condition, systematically abstracted, and analyzed. An illustrative case that provides the most definitive support for a vascular cause is presented. Treatment considerations based on prior cases and expert opinions are provided. RESULTS: Sixty-four cases of surfer's myelopathy have been reported to date. This atraumatic thoracic/conus medullaris myelopathy with only a 42\% neurological recovery rate almost uniformly affects young, healthy, novice surfers who have no pre-existent spinal disease. Symptoms usually start with back pain and rapidly progress to complete or incomplete myelopathy. T2 magnetic resonance images show increased signal in the central spinal cord within 24 to 72 hours. Gadolinium enhancement and diffusion-weighted imaging are not helpful. Angiography has been underused. Angiogram in our case showed the absence of a right T12 radicular artery and no artery of Adamkiewicz, which, along with clinical findings, support the vascular origin theory. Incomplete cases often improve within 24 hours of onset, whereas no improvement has been reported for American Spinal Injury Association class A cases. Several acute interventions have been tried. Steroids are most common, and patients receiving steroids improved 55\% of the time with no reported adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Surfer's myelopathy is a clinical entity associated with complete deficit in {$>$}50\% of cases. Its prognosis is almost exclusively dictated by severity at presentation/nadir. Thus, publicizing this rare but serious condition (within and outside the medical literature) may be an effective intervention.},

The study's goal is to compare the effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (VR) training in balance among individuals with incomplete paraplegia to that of functional electrical stimulation (FES). DESIGN: Two groups, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Neurological Physiotherapy Out Patient Department, Tertiary Care Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen people aged 18-60 years with incomplete SCI. INTERVENTIONS: VR training along with conventional physical therapy (CPT) and FES for Rectus Abdominis and Erector Spinae with CPT five times a week for 4 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were Modified Functional Reach Test (mFRT) and Function in Sitting Test (FIST) to assess sitting balance and Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (SCIM III) for the level of independence. Assessments were taken before initiating treatment and at the end of the 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. Within-group analyses for the mFRT values were performed using Repeated Measures ANOVA test, and between-group analyses were performed using the independent t-test test. Friedman and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used for analyzing FIST and SCIM III. RESULTS: All variables (mFRT and FIST) improved significantly in both groups (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), with the VR\,+\,CPT group showing a more significant result than the FES\,+\,CPT group (P value\,{$<$}\,0.05), except for SCIM III. CONCLUSION: VR as an adjunct to CPT demonstrated proved to be an effective treatment to improve balance among individuals with incomplete paraplegia.Trial registration: Clinical Trials Registry India identifier: CTRI/2020/03/024080.},

  abstract = {The Movement Disorder Society Task Force for Rating Scales for Parkinson's disease (PD) prepared a critique of the Hoehn and Yahr scale (HY). Strengths of the HY scale include its wide utilization and acceptance. Progressively higher stages correlate with neuroimaging studies of dopaminergic loss, and high correlations exist between the HY scale and some standardized scales of motor impairment, disability, and quality of life. Weaknesses include the scale's mixing of impairment and disability and its non-linearity. Because the HY scale is weighted heavily toward postural instability as the primary index of disease severity, it does not capture completely impairments or disability from other motor features of PD and gives no information on nonmotor problems. Direct clinimetric testing of the HY scale has been very limited, but the scale fulfills at least some criteria for reliability and validity, especially for the midranges of the scale (Stages 2-4). Although a "modified HY scale" that includes 0.5 increments has been adopted widely, no clinimetric data are available on this adaptation. The Task Force recommends that: (1) the HY scale be used in its original form for demographic presentation of patient groups; (2) when the HY scale is used for group description, medians and ranges should be reported and analysis of changes should use nonparametric methods; (3) in research settings, the HY scale is useful primarily for defining inclusion/exclusion criteria; (4) to retain simplicity, clinicians should "rate what you see" and therefore incorporate comorbidities when assigning a HY stage; and (5) because of the wide usage of the modified HY scale with 0.5 increments, this adaptation warrants clinimetric testing. Without such testing, however, the original five-point scales should be maintained.},

METHOD: A literature search was carried out in the PubMed database, with the search phrases "traumatic spinal cord injury"/"traumatic spinal cord injuries" together with "autonomic dysfunction", "autonomic dysreflexia" and "cardiovascular disease". RESULTS: The most important cardiovascular complications in the acute phase are bradyarrhythmia, hypotension, enhanced vasovagal reflexes, supraventricular/ventricular ectopic beats, vasodilation and venous stasis. Important in the chronic phase are orthostatic hypotension and impaired regulation of blood pressure, blood volume and body temperature. Tetraplegia is frequently accompanied by autonomic dysreflexia, impaired transmission of cardial pain, loss of muscle mass in the left ventricle and pseudoinfarction. Patients with injuries above the sixth thoracic vertebra have a predisposition for autonomic dysreflexia. This is a condition characterised by sudden, uncontrolled sympathetic response accompanied by a rise in blood pressure. Autonomic dysreflexia usually leads to headaches and erythema on the upper chest. The condition may cause cerebral haemorrhage and is potentially life threatening. Patients with spinal cord injuries have an increased risk of atherosclerotic disease due to overweight, lipid disorders, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. They are predisposed to thrombotic emboli due to venous stasis and hypercoagulopathy, particularly immediately after the injury. INTERPRETATION: Knowledge of cardiovascular sequelae after spinal cord injuries and assessment of these is important for correct diagnostics, planning of preventive measures and optimal treatment.},

METHODS: We searched for clinical trials in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, and Cochrane till April 2020 using relevant keywords. Data were extracted and pooled as mean difference (MD) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) by Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled trials with 372 patients were included. Dance showed a significant improvement over the control group in term of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) after three (MD\,= -\,4.49, 95\% CI [-\,6.78,\,-\,2.21], p\,=\,0.00001), six, (MD\,=\,-\,5.96, 95\% CI [-\,8.89,\,-\,3.02], p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), and 12 months (MD\,=\,-\,14.58, 95\% CI [-\,24.76,\,-\,4.4], p\,=\,0.005), and Mini-BES test after 12 months. Compared to exercise, dance showed a significant improvement in Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Mini-BES test.

The "No Use Is Disuse" study is the first explorative, randomized controlled trial in boys with DMD to examine whether assisted bicycle training is feasible, safe, and beneficial. METHODS: Ambulatory and recently wheelchair-dependent boys with DMD were allocated to the intervention or control group. The intervention group received assisted bicycle training of the legs and arms during 24 weeks. The control group received the same training after a waiting period of 24 weeks. The primary study outcomes were the Motor Function Measure (MFM) and the Assisted 6-Minute Cycling Test (A6MCT). Group differences were examined by an analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Thirty boys (mean age 10.5 {\textpm} 2.6 years, 18 ambulant and 12 wheelchair-dependent) were allocated to the intervention (n = 17) or the control (n = 13) group. All boys in the intervention group (except one) completed the training. After 24 weeks, the total MFM score remained stable in the intervention group, whereas it had significantly decreased in the control group ({$\Delta$} = 4.9, 95\% confidence interval = 2.2-7.6). No significant group differences were found for the A6MCT. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that assisted bicycle training of the legs and arms is feasible and safe for both ambulant and wheelchair-dependent children and may decline the deterioration due to disuse. Progressive deterioration, however, may compromise the design of trials for DMD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Randomized clinical trials have shown that aerobic exercise attenuates motor symptom progression in Parkinson's disease, but the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated how aerobic exercise influences disease-related functional and structural changes in the corticostriatal sensorimotor network, which is involved in the emergence of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we explored effects of aerobic exercise on tissue integrity of the substantia nigra, and on behavioral and cerebral indices of cognitive control. METHODS: The Park-in-Shape trial is a single-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial in 130 Parkinson's disease patients who were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to aerobic exercise (stationary home trainer) or stretching (active control) interventions (duration~=~6 months). An unselected subset from this trial (exercise, n~=~25; stretching, n~=~31) underwent resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and an oculomotor cognitive control task (pro- and antisaccades), at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Aerobic exercise, but not stretching, led to increased functional connectivity of the anterior putamen with the sensorimotor cortex relative to the posterior putamen. Behaviorally, aerobic exercise also improved cognitive control. Furthermore, aerobic exercise increased functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, proportionally to fitness improvements, and it reduced global brain atrophy. INTERPRETATION: MRI, clinical, and behavioral results converge toward the conclusion that aerobic exercise stabilizes disease progression in the corticostriatal sensorimotor network and enhances cognitive performance.

It causes mortality and disability among all group ages, caused by external force, sports-related events or violence and road traffic accidents. In the USA, approximately one-third people die annually due to injury and 1.7 million people suffer from traumatic brain injury. Every year in India around 1.6 million individuals suffer from sustain brain injury with 200,000 deaths and approximately one million person needed recovery treatment at any stage of time. Sports-related head impact and trauma has become an extremely controversial public health and medico-legal problem that accounts for 20\% of all brain injury (including concussion). It is difficult to reverse the primary injury but the secondary injury can be minimized by using proper pharmacological intervention during the initial hours of injury. This article highlights the pathophysiology and types of TBI along with treatment therapies. Till date, there is no single medication that can decrease the progression of the disease so that symptomatic treatment is given to the patient by determining proper pathology. Recently various herbal medicine therapies and traditional supplements have been developed for TBI. Nutritional supplementation and nutraceuticals have exposed potential in the treatment of TBI when used before and after TBI. The compiled data will enable the readers to know the pathophysiology as well as the allopathic and natural remedies to treat the TBI.},

  abstract = {The pace of nigrostriatal degeneration, both with regards to striatal denervation and loss of melanin and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, is poorly understood especially early in the Parkinson's disease process. This study investigated the extent of nigrostriatal degeneration in patients with Parkinson's disease at different disease durations from time of diagnosis. Brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (n=28) with post-diagnostic intervals of 1-27 years and normal elderly control subjects (n=9) were examined. Sections of the post-commissural putamen and substantia nigra pars compacta were processed for tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter immunohistochemistry. The post-commissural putamen was selected due to tissue availability and the fact that dopamine loss in this region is associated with motor disability in Parkinson's disease. Quantitative assessments of putaminal dopaminergic fibre density and stereological estimates of the number of melanin-containing and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (both in total and in subregions) were performed by blinded investigators in cases where suitable material was available (n=17). Dopaminergic markers in the dorsal putamen showed a modest loss at 1 year after diagnosis in the single case available for study. There was variable (moderate to marked) loss, at 3 years. At 4 years post-diagnosis and thereafter, there was virtually complete loss of staining in the dorsal putamen with only an occasional abnormal dopaminergic fibre detected. In the substantia nigra pars compacta, there was a 50-90\% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons from the earliest time points studied with only marginal additional loss thereafter. There was only a {$\sim$}10\% loss of melanized neurons in the one case evaluated 1 year post-diagnosis, and variable (30 to 60\%) loss during the first several years post-diagnosis with more gradual and subtle loss in the second decade. At all time points, there were more melanin-containing than tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells. Loss of dopaminergic markers in the dorsal putamen occurs rapidly and is virtually complete by 4 years post-diagnosis. Loss of melanized nigral neurons lags behind the loss of dopamine markers. These findings have important implications for understanding the nature of Parkinson's disease neurodegeneration and for studies of putative neuroprotective/restorative therapies.},

The incidence of GBS can therefore increase during outbreaks of infectious diseases, as was seen during the Zika virus epidemics in 2013 in French Polynesia and 2015 in Latin America. Diagnosis and management of GBS can be complicated as its clinical presentation and disease course are heterogeneous, and no international clinical guidelines are currently available. To support clinicians, especially in the context of an outbreak, we have developed a globally applicable guideline for the diagnosis and management of GBS. The guideline is based on current literature and expert consensus, and has a ten-step structure to facilitate its use in clinical practice. We first provide an introduction to the diagnostic criteria, clinical variants and differential diagnoses of GBS. The ten steps then cover early recognition and diagnosis of GBS, admission to the intensive care unit, treatment indication and selection, monitoring and treatment of disease progression, prediction of clinical course and outcome, and management of complications and sequelae.},

Second, we examined safety and feasibility of a 12-wk in-home, remotely supervised, mild-moderate intensity strengthening program in eight boys. Safety measures included T2 MRI, creatine kinase levels, and pain. Peak strength and function (time to ascend/descend four stairs) were also measured. RESULTS: Dose-escalation revealed no signs of muscle damage. Seven of the eight boys completed the 12-wk in-home program with a compliance of 84.9\%, no signs of muscle damage, and improvements in strength (knee extensors P\,{$<$}\,.01; knee flexors P\,{$<$}\,.05) and function (descending steps P\,{$<$}\,.05).

METHODS: As part of a randomized controlled trial, patients were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of TT (n = 17, mean age 71.5 {\textpm} 1.5 years, disease duration 11.6 {\textpm} 1.6 years; 70\% men) or TT + VR (n = 17, mean age 71.2 {\textpm} 1.7 years, disease duration 7.9 {\textpm} 1.4 years; 65\% men). A previously validated fMRI imagery paradigm assessed changes in neural activation pretraining and post-training. Participants imagined themselves walking in 2 virtual scenes projected in the fMRI: (1) a clear path and (2) a path with virtual obstacles. Whole brain and region of interest analyses were performed. RESULTS: Brain activation patterns were similar between training arms before the interventions. After training, participants in the TT + VR arm had lower activation than the TT arm in Brodmann area 10 and the inferior frontal gyrus (cluster level familywise error-corrected [FWEcorr] p {$<$} 0.012), while the TT arm had lower activation than TT + VR in the cerebellum and middle temporal gyrus (cluster level FWEcorr p {$<$} 0.001). Changes in fall frequency and brain activation were correlated in the TT + VR arm. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise modifies brain activation patterns in patients with PD in a mode-specific manner. Motor-cognitive training decreased the reliance on frontal regions, which apparently resulted in improved function, perhaps reflecting increased brain efficiency.},

I investigated the efficacy of standardized mental status testing on the sport sideline to detect abnormalities that result from concussion and provide an objective measure of postinjury cognitive recovery. DESIGN AND SETTING: All subjects underwent a standardized preseason baseline mental status evaluation. Standardized testing of injured and uninjured control subjects was repeated on the sideline immediately after concussion and 48 hours after injury. SUBJECTS: Sixty-three high school and collegiate football players with concussion and 55 uninjured control subjects were studied. MEASUREMENTS: The Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) was administered to evaluate neurocognitive functioning and neurologic status. RESULTS: Immediately after concussion, injured subjects performed significantly below preinjury baseline and below uninjured controls on the SAC. Measurable deficits in orientation, concentration, and memory were evident immediately after concussion. A decline in SAC score at time of injury was 95\% sensitive and 76\% specific in accurately classifying injured and uninjured subjects on the sideline. Injured subjects demonstrated significant improvements in SAC score 48 hours after injury. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized mental status testing can be a valuable tool to assist the sports medicine clinician in detecting the immediate effects of concussion on mental status, tracking resolution of immediate postconcussive mental status abnormalities, and making more informed decisions on return to play after injury.},

There is limited research available comparing the presence of examination findings among individuals with PPCS from different age groups. METHODS: Retrospective case-control chart review of 481 patients with PPCS and 271 non-trauma controls. Physical assessments were categorized as ocular, cervical, and vestibular/balance. Differences in presentation were compared between PPCS and controls as well as between individuals with PPCS in three age groups: adolescents, young adults, and older adults. RESULTS: All three PPCS groups had more abnormal oculomotor findings than their age-matched counterparts. When comparing PPCS patients from different age groups, no differences were seen in prevalence of abnormal smooth pursuits or saccades; however, adolescents with PPCS had more abnormal cervical findings and a lower prevalence of abnormal NPC, vestibular and balance findings. CONCLUSION: Patients with PPCS presented with a different constellation of clinical findings based on their age. Adolescents were more likely to demonstrate evidence of cervical injury compared to younger and older adults, and adults were more likely to present with vestibular findings and impaired NPC. Adults with PPCS were more likely to present with abnormal oculomotor findings compared to adults with non-traumatic causes of dizziness.},

However, increasing evidence has suggested progressive cognitive and psychiatric changes as well. Forty-six patients with PD, ranging in severity from Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) score of 1:4, were recruited from a clinic specializing in PD. Various cognitive and neuropsychological measures were used to discover if there were indeed differences due to the progression of PD. As H-Y stage significantly increased, so did age and levodopa equivalency dose of medications, both independent of one another. Years of education had a significant negative relationship with H-Y score. Measures of general cognition divulged a significant decrease as H-Y score increased. Finally, as H-Y score increased, magical ideation decreased, and religious group social support increased. Mechanistically, the significant cognitive decline occurring with H-Y staging may be linked to a reduced dopaminergic function. Significant cognitive and neuropsychological changes are associated with the progression of PD and its possible relationship to Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS).},

  abstract = {The brain-gut axis has been identified as an important contributor to the physiopathology of Parkinson's disease. In this pathology, inflammation is thought to be driven by the damage caused by aggregation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein in the brain. Interestingly, the Braak's theory proposes that {$\alpha$}-synuclein misfolding may originate in the gut and spread in a "prion-like" manner through the vagus nerve into the central nervous system. In the enteric nervous system, enteric glial cells are the most abundant cellular component. Several studies have evaluated their role in Parkinson's disease. Using samples obtained from patients, cell cultures, or animal models, the studies with specific antibodies to label enteric glial cells (GFAP, Sox-10, and S100{$\beta$}) seem to indicate that activation and reactive gliosis are associated to the neurodegeneration produced by Parkinson's disease in the enteric nervous system. Of interest, Toll-like receptors, which are expressed on enteric glial cells, participate in the triggering of immune/inflammatory responses, in the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity and in the configuration of gut microbiota; thus, these receptors might contribute to Parkinson's disease. External factors like stress also seem to be relevant in its pathogenesis. Some authors have studied ways to reverse changes in EGCs with interventions such as administration of Tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors, nutraceuticals, or physical exercise. Some researchers point out that beyond being activated during the disease, enteric glial cells may contribute to the development of synucleinopathies. Thus, it is still necessary to further study these cells and their role in Parkinson's disease.},

Many mutations have been described in this gene, most of which affect the expression of the muscle isoform, the best-known protein product of this locus. These mutations result in the Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD and BMD). However, there are several other tissue specific isoforms of dystrophin, some exclusively or predominantly expressed in the brain or the retina. Mutations affecting the correct expression of these tissue-specific isoforms have been associated with the CNS involvement common in DMD. Rare mutations also account for the allelic disorder X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy, in which dystrophin expression or function is affected mostly or exclusively in the heart. Genotype definition of the dystrophin gene in patients with dystrophinopathies has taught us much about functionally important domains of the protein itself and has provided insights into several regulatory mechanisms governing the gene expression profile. Here, we focus on current understanding of the genotype-phenotype relation for mutations in the dystrophin gene and their implications for gene functions.},

Virtual Reality Training (VRT) may provide an interactive medium of rehabilitation, preventing a reduction in active participation of the patients while allowing for the training of sitting balance. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of VRT to conventional therapy in improving sitting balance in persons with SCI. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a single blinded randomized control trial conducted on 21 subjects with SCI (level of injury: D10 or below). They were randomly allocated into two groups; both groups received their routine exercise program. In addition, the intervention group, that is, Group B (n = 11) received 30 min of VRT in the seated position using Xbox-Kinect, while the conventional therapy group, that is, Group A (n = 10) received 30 min of additional conventional therapy to equalize the duration of the intervention (3 days/week, 4 weeks). The modified functional reach test and T-shirt test were measured at the beginning and at the end of 4 weeks. RESULTS: MFRT changes for forward (Group A: 1.7 {\textpm} 1.09 cm; Group B: 4.83 {\textpm} 2.95 cm), right lateral (Group A: 2.43 {\textpm} 2.81 cm, Group B: 5.08 {\textpm} 1.85 cm), left lateral (Group A: 3.05 {\textpm} 4.65 cm, Group B: 6.19 {\textpm} 1.51 cm) were statistically significant for Group B (P {$<$} 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the two groups for T-shirt test (P {$>$} 0.05).

There is growing evidence that physiotherapy is an effective treatment, but the existing literature has limited explanations of what physiotherapy should consist of and there are insufficient data to produce evidence-based guidelines. We aim to address this issue by presenting recommendations for physiotherapy treatment. METHODS: A meeting was held between physiotherapists, neurologists and neuropsychiatrists, all with extensive experience in treating FMD. A set of consensus recommendations were produced based on existing evidence and experience. RESULTS: We recommend that physiotherapy treatment is based on a biopsychosocial aetiological framework. Treatment should address illness beliefs, self-directed attention and abnormal habitual movement patterns through a process of education, movement retraining and self-management strategies within a positive and non-judgemental context. We provide specific examples of these strategies for different symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Physiotherapy has a key role in the multidisciplinary management of patients with FMD. There appear to be specific physiotherapy techniques which are useful in FMD and which are amenable to and require prospective evaluation. The processes involved in referral, treatment and discharge from physiotherapy should be considered carefully as a part of a treatment package.},

Despite its prevalence and associated negative rehabilitation outcomes, no clinical practice guidelines exist for the rehabilitation of post-stroke lateropulsion. We aimed to develop consensus-based clinical practice recommendations for managing post-stroke lateropulsion using an international expert panel. DESIGN: This Delphi panel process conformed with Guidance on Conducting and Reporting Delphi Studies recommendations. PARTICIPANTS: Panel members had demonstrated clinical and/or scientific background in the rehabilitation of people with post-stroke lateropulsion. MAIN MEASURES: The process consisted of four electronic survey rounds. Round One consisted of 13 open questions. Subsequent rounds ascertained levels of agreement with statements derived from Round One. Consensus was defined a priori as {$\geq$}75\% agreement (agree or strongly agree), or {$\geq$}70\% agreement after excluding 'unsure' responses. RESULTS: Twenty participants completed all four rounds. Consensus was achieved regarding a total of 119 recommendations for rehabilitation approaches and considerations for rehabilitation delivery, positioning, managing fear of falling and fatigue, optimal therapy dose, and discharge planning. Statements for which 'some agreement' (50\%-74\% agreement) was achieved and those for which recommendations remain to be clarified were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations build on existing evidence to guide the selection of interventions for post-stroke lateropulsion. Future research is required to elaborate specific rehabilitation strategies, consider the impact of additional cognitive and perceptual impairments, describe positioning options, and detail optimal therapy dose for people with lateropulsion.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs in patients of all age groups and is a significant public health issue. In the United States, 1.5 million TBIs occur annually, 75\% of TBIs are classified as mild, and costs~are generated of \$17 billion each year. Most patients that suffer from TBI will have spontaneous resolution of symptoms, but for some patients, symptoms may linger and negatively affect daily cognitive function. Post-concussive syndrome (PCS) demarcates the constellation of symptoms seen most often in~prolonged~mild TBI, however, it may also occur following moderate and severe TBI. Clinical criteria for PCS are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). PCS is a constellation of physical, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional symptoms occurring after TBI. These symptoms include a headache, fatigue, vision changes, disturbances in balance, confusion, dizziness, insomnia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and difficulty with concentration.~Approximately 90\% of concussion symptoms are transient, with symptoms resolving within 10 to 14 days but may linger for weeks. Persistent PCS occurs when symptoms persist past 3 months. Fifteen percent of mild TBI patients will suffer from PCS, and a small minority of those patients will experience persistent PCS requiring further evaluation and treatment. Research has shown that mild TBI resulting in persistent PCS has lasting effects on cognition, memory, learning, and executive function. Patients who suffer more than one~brain injury are at increased risk for PCS. Due to limited diagnostic tools, those permanent changes in executive function can go undocumented. Thus, the 15\% incidence of PCS is an underestimation of the true incidence.},

Here we highlight the following points of attention during evaluation of patients with functional disorder: not all bizarre behavior is functional; not every event triggered by an emotional factor is a functional disorder; not every topographic incongruity is a functional disorder; patients may present functional and organic symptoms at the same time; psychiatric comorbid condition is not always evident in the history of a functional disorder; problematic communication at the time of diagnosis can compromise treatment and prognosis. In conclusion, we emphasize that special attention to these possible pitfalls facilitate the correct diagnosis and management of functional neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, that still lacks of a disease-modifying treatment. Consistent evidence proved the benefits of physical therapy on motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients, leading the scientific community to propose physical activity as disease-modifying therapy for PD and suggesting the involvement of neurotrophic factors (NFs) as key mediators of neuroplasticity. However, the lack of standardized exercise training and methodological flaws of clinical trials have limited the evidence demonstrating the exercise-induced changes in serum and plasma neurotrophic factors concentration. A systematic search, covering 20 years of research in this field and including randomized and non-randomized controlled trials (RCTs and non-RCTs), which reported changes in serum and plasma NFs after a specific intervention, were reviewed. Pooled effect sizes (p-ESs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CIs) were calculated using a random effects model with R software. A total of 18 articles, of which exercise programs of interventions were codified in terms of type, intensity and duration adopting a standardisation methodology, were included in the systematic review. Six papers, describing the effect of different training programs on BDNF and IGF-1 levels, were included and independently analysed in two meta-analyses. Quantitative analysis for BDNF indicated a statistically significant improvement in serum concentration of PD patients (MD: 5.99~ng/mL; 95\%IC: 0.15~-11.83; I2 = 77\%) performing physical activity compared with control conditions in RCTs. Preliminary evidence supported the hypothesis that a moderate intensity aerobic exercise (MIAE) would be necessary to induce the changes in NFs. However, sensitivity analysis of meta-analysis and the few studies included in subgroup analysis did not support these results. Alongside, meta-analysis followed by sensitivity analysis revealed a potential change in serum IGF-1 (MD: 33.47~ng/mL; 95\%IC: 8.09-58.85) in PD patients performing physical activity with respect controls in RCT studies. Considering the limited evidence to support or refute the increase in NFs levels in PD patients performing physical activity, there is a need to develop a rigorous controlled randomized trial, with standardization for loading intensity of physical activity, greater sample size, and a correct stratification of PD patients to establish a well-defined correlation between physical activity and NFs levels.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Persistent ({$>$}4 weeks) postconcussion symptoms (PPCS) are challenging for both patients and clinicians. There is uncertainty about the effect of commonly applied nonpharmacological treatments for the management of PPCS. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess and summarize evidence for outcomes related to 7 nonpharmacological interventions for PPCS in adults (aged {$>$}18 years) and provide recommendations for clinical practice. DATA SOURCES: Systematic literature searches were performed via Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PEDro, OTseeker, and Cochrane Reviews (via MEDLINE and Embase) from earliest possible publication year to March 3, 2020. The literature was searched for prior systematic reviews and primary studies. To be included, studies had to be intervention studies with a control group and focus on PPCS. STUDY SELECTION: A multidisciplinary guideline panel selected interventions based on frequency of use and need for decision support among clinicians, including early information and advice, graded physical exercise, vestibular rehabilitation, manual treatment of neck and back, oculomotor vision treatment, psychological treatment, and interdisciplinary coordinated rehabilitative treatment. To be included, studies had to be intervention studies within the areas of the predefined clinical questions, include a control group, and focus on symptoms after concussion or mild traumatic brain injury. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Extraction was performed independently by multiple observers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for data abstraction and data quality assessment. Included studies were assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the Cochrane Risk of Bias (randomized clinical trials) tool. Meta-analysis was performed for all interventions where possible. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled estimates of effects. The level and certainty of evidence was rated and recommendations formulated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All outcomes were planned before data collection began according to a specified protocol. The primary outcomes were the collective burden of PPCS and another outcome reflecting the focus of a particular intervention (eg, physical functioning after graded exercise intervention). RESULTS: Eleven systematic reviews were identified but did not contribute any primary studies; 19 randomized clinical trials comprising 2007 participants (1064 women [53.0\%]) were separately identified and included. Evidence for the 7 interventions ranged from no evidence meeting the inclusion criteria to very low and low levels of evidence. Recommendations were weak for early information and advice, graded physical exercise, vestibular rehabilitation, manual treatment of the neck and back, psychological treatment, and interdisciplinary coordinated rehabilitative treatment. No relevant evidence was identified for oculomotor vision treatment, so the panel provided a good clinical practice recommendation based on consensus. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on very low to low certainty of evidence or based on consensus, the guideline panel found weak scientific support for commonly applied nonpharmacological interventions to treat PPCS. Results align with recommendations in international guidelines. Intensified research into all types of intervention for PPCS is needed.},

METHODS: Thirty-five participants were randomly allocated to a 36-session aerobic exercise or control intervention. Each participant underwent an functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while playing a reward task before and after the intervention to determine the effect of exercise on the activity of the ventral striatum in anticipation of reward. A subset of participants (n = 25) completed [11 C] raclopride positron emission tomography scans to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked release of endogenous dopamine in the dorsal striatum. All participants completed motor (MDS-UPDRS part III, finger tapping, Timed-up-and-go) and nonmotor assessments (Starkstein Apathy Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, reaction time, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Trail Making Test [A and B], and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) before and after the interventions. RESULTS: The aerobic group exhibited increased activity in the ventral striatum during functional magnetic resonance imaging in anticipation of 75\% probability of reward (P = 0.01). The aerobic group also demonstrated increased repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked dopamine release in the caudate nucleus (P = 0.04) and increased baseline nondisplaceable binding potential in the posterior putamen of the less affected repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation-stimulated hemisphere measured by position emission tomography (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise alters the responsivity of the ventral striatum, likely related to changes to the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, and increases evoked dopamine release in the caudate nucleus. This suggests that the therapeutic benefits of exercise are in part related to corticostriatal plasticity and enhanced dopamine release. {\copyright} 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

Materials and methods All adult patients (age {$>$}18 years) whose clinical diagnosis was GBS but diagnostic tests (either NCS or CSF analysis or both) were not suggestive of GBS were included in the study and were tested for anti-gangliosides antibodies. Data was entered in SPSS, version 21.0~(IBM, Armonk, New York) and analyzed. Results Of the 15 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 60\% had a normal CSF analysis while 40\% had normal NCS. The percentages of different GBS variants observed in sampled patients were acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy (AIDP) 40\%, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) 40\%, acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) 13.3\%, and Miller Fisher syndrome 6.7\%. However, the anti-ganglioside antibodies were negative in all patients. Conclusion Anti-gangliosides antibodies cannot be used as an alternative diagnostic investigation in GBS patients as our study failed to show positive results in different GBS variants.},

It can be diagnosed with clinically definite certainty at the bedside by ascertaining its inconsistent (distractibility, frequency variability) and incongruent features (entrainment, ballistic suppression), requiring no additional neurological investigations except, in selected cases, those serving to elevate the diagnostic category to laboratory supported using accelerometry and surface electromyography. In the background of excessive attention to the affected body part and abnormal beliefs and expectations, functional correlates include the impairment of emotion processing, sense of agency, and abnormal connectivity between limbic and motor regions. While the treatment options remain under-studied, promising interventions in physiotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and other psychotherapies are under evaluation to assessing their efficacy in attenuating this important source of neurological disability.

  abstract = {Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide. Most patients present with an antecedent illness, most commonly upper respiratory tract infection, before the onset of progressive motor weakness. Several microorganisms have been associated with Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, most notably Campylobacter jejuni, Zika virus, and in 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In C jejuni-related Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, there is good evidence to support an autoantibody-mediated immune process that is triggered by molecular mimicry between structural components of peripheral nerves and the microorganism. Making a diagnosis of so-called classical Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome is straightforward; however, the existing diagnostic criteria have limitations and can result in some variants of the syndrome being missed. Most patients with Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome do well with immunotherapy, but a substantial proportion are left with disability, and death can occur. Results from the International Guillain-Barr{\'e} Syndrome Outcome Study suggest that geographical variations exist in Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, including insufficient access to immunotherapy in low-income countries. There is a need to provide improved access to treatment for all patients with Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, and to develop effective disease-modifying therapies that can limit the extent of nerve injury. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate some of the potential therapeutic candidates, including complement inhibitors, which, together with emerging data from large international collaborative studies on the syndrome, will contribute substantially to understanding the many facets of this disease.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common movement disorder associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Mutations in the PD-associated gene PARK7 alter the structure and function of the encoded protein DJ-1, and the resulting autosomal recessively inherited disease increases the risk of developing PD. DJ-1 was first discovered in 1997 as an oncogene and was associated with early-onset PD in 2003. Mutations in DJ-1 account for approximately 1\% of all recessively inherited early-onset PD occurrences, and the functions of the protein have been studied extensively. In healthy subjects, DJ-1 acts as an antioxidant and oxidative stress sensor in several neuroprotective mechanisms. It is also involved in mitochondrial homeostasis, regulation of apoptosis, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and dopamine homeostasis by regulating various signaling pathways, transcription factors, and molecular chaperone functions. While DJ-1 protects neurons against damaging reactive oxygen species, neurotoxins, and mutant {$\alpha$}-synuclein, mutations in the protein may lead to inefficient neuroprotection and the progression of PD. As current therapies treat only the symptoms of PD, the development of therapies that directly inhibit oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death is critical. DJ-1 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target, while oxidized DJ-1 could operate as a biomarker for PD. In this paper, we review the role of DJ-1 in the pathogenesis of PD by highlighting some of its key neuroprotective functions and the consequences of its dysfunction.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test a new neurological sign, the "abductor sign," which can distinguish between organic and non-organic leg paresis using synergic movements of the bilateral hip abductors. METHODS: The subjects were 33 patients presenting with paresis of one leg, 17 of organic origin and 16 of non-organic origin (hysteria). To test the abductor sign, the examiner told the patient to abduct each leg, and opposed this movement with his hands placed on the lateral surfaces of the patient's legs. The leg contralateral to the abducted one showed opposite actions for organic paresis and non-organic paresis: for example, when the paretic leg was abducted, the sound leg stayed fixed in organic paresis, but moved in the hyperadducting direction in non-organic paresis. Hoover's sign was used for comparison in the same patients. RESULTS: The abductor sign gave the correct classification for all 33 cases. Hoover's sign was reliable if the results were carefully interpreted, but it was non-diagnostic for 16 patients because of strong hip extensors and in two because of strong hip flexors. Two patients with non-organic paresis succeeded in tricking the examiner by pretending full effort to lift the paretic leg. CONCLUSIONS: The abductor sign is a useful test to detect non-organic paresis, because (1) it is difficult for a hysterical patient to deceive the examiner, (2) the hip abductor is one of the most commonly involved muscles in pyramidal weakness, and (3) the results are easily visible as movement or non-movement of the unabducted leg.},

Studies regarding exercise and cardiovascular fitness, angiogenesis, neuroinflammation in relation to IGF-1 signalling, regulation of neurotrophins, neurogenesis and plasticity, cognitive training, are briefly described. We propose that current evidence points towards a mechanism by which cardiovascular fitness improvements act to promote long-term angiogenesis and cerebral circulation. This important adaptation allows for increased delivery and upregulation of neurotrophins along with supporting factors to the brain, particularly to the hippocampal neurogenic niche, following acute exercise bouts. We propose a sequential timeline and approximate time scale for this mechanism, describing how these stages generate increased support for neurogenesis and brain plasticity in combination with cognitive training to provide long-term cognitive benefits and protection against age-related cognitive decline. Influences from age, gender and other variables are considered, and methodological factors that could be utilised in future studies to further clarify the proposed model are discussed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               The objective of this study was to determine the demographics and predictors of postconcussion syndrome (PCS) in a large series of patients using a novel definition of PCS.                                         METHODS               The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of 284 consecutive concussed patients, 221 of whom had PCS on the basis of at least 3 symptoms persisting at least 1 month. This definition of PCS was uniformly employed and is unique in accepting an expanded list of symptoms, in shortening the postconcussion interval to 1 month from 3 months, and in excluding those with focal injuries such as hemorrhages and contusions.                                         RESULTS                                The 221 cases showed considerable heterogeneity in clinical features of PCS. They averaged 3.3 concussions, with a range of 0 to 12 or more concussions, and 62.4\% occurred during sports and recreation. The median duration of PCS was 7 months at the time of examination, with 11.8\% lasting more than 2 years, and 23.1\% with PCS had only 1 concussion. The average patient age was 27 years (range 10--74 years). The average number of persistent symptoms was 8.1; 26.2\% had a previous psychiatric condition, attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, a learning disability, or previous migraine headaches. The prevalence of arachnoid cysts and Chiari malformation in PCS exceeded the general population. Additionally, involvement in litigation, presence of extracranial injuries, amnesia and/or loss of consciousness, and female sex were predictive of reporting a high number of symptoms. A prior history of psychiatric conditions or migraines, cause of injury, number of previous concussions, and age did not significantly predict symptom number. Only the number of symptoms reported predicted the duration of PCS. To predict the number of symptoms for those who fulfilled PCS criteria according to the                 International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision                 (ICD-10), and the                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition                 (DSM-IV), the number of previous concussions was significant.                                                        CONCLUSIONS               PCS is commonly associated with multiple concussions, but 23.1\% in the present series occurred after only 1 concussion. Most patients with PCS had multiple symptoms persisting for months or years. The median duration of PCS was 7 months, with a range up to 26 years. In only 11.3\%, the PCS had ended at the time of consultation. Not all predictors commonly cited in the literature align with the findings in this study. This is likely due to differences in the definitions of PCS used in research. These results suggest that the use of ICD-10 and DSM-IV to diagnose PCS may be biased toward those who are vulnerable to concussions or with more severe forms of PCS. It is thus important to redefine PCS based on evidence-based medicine.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Bradykinesia and muscle weaknesses are common symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and are associated with impaired functional performance, increased risk of falls, and reduced quality of life. Recent studies have pointed to progressive resistance training (PRT) as an effective method to control and reduce these symptoms, increasing possibilities to treat the disease. However, few studies have focused on assessing the PRT effects in the short-term. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the short-term PRT effects on people with PD, in order to offer new parameters for a better understanding of its effects, so as an adequation and PRT use as a complementary therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty individuals diagnosed with PD from stage 1 to 3 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale took part on the study and were allocated into 2 groups; Training Group (TG) performed a 9-week RT program twice a week, and the Control Group (CG) attended disease lectures. Bradykinesia UPDRS subscale (BSS), knee extensors isokinetic strength, Ten Meters Walk Test (TMW), Timed Up\&Go Test (TUG) and 30-Second Chair Stand (T30) were measured before and after the intervention period. Statistical significance was set at p {$\leq$} 0.05. RESULTS: Significant time was noted by the group interaction for all functional tests (TUG, T30, and TWM; all p {$<$} 0.01) and BSS (p {$<$} 0.01). Post hoc analyses revealed that these differences were driven by significant improvements in these dependent variables (all p {$<$} 0.01) while the CG remained unchanged (all p {$>$} 0.05). Moreover, TUG, T30, TWM, and BSS were significantly different between TG and CG in the post-training assessments (all p {$<$} 0.01). Isokinetic muscle strength was slightly increased in the TG (2.4\%) and decreased in the CG (-2.2\%), but statistical analyses did not reach significance for interaction but only a trend (p = 0.12). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that 9 weeks of PRT reduces bradykinesia and improves functional performance in patients with mild to moderate PD. These findings reinforce this mode of exercise as an important component of public health promotion programs for PD.},

In the last decade an increasing number of reports continue to support a bidirectional and symbiotic relationship between sleep and memory. Studies using procedural and declarative learning tasks have demonstrated the need for sleep after learning in the offline consolidation of new memories. Furthermore, these consolidation benefits appear to be mediated by an overnight neural reorganization of memory that may result in a more efficient storage of information, affording improved next-day recall. Sleep before learning also appears to be critical for brain functioning. Specifically, one night of sleep deprivation markedly impairs hippocampal function, imposing a deficit in the ability to commit new experiences to memory. Taken together, these observations are of particular ecologic importance from a professional and education perspective when considering that sleep time continues to decrease across all age ranges throughout industrialized nations.},

The facial nerve has a motor and parasympathetic function as well as taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.~This nerve also controls salivary and lacrimal glands. The motor function of the peripheral facial nerve controls the upper and lower facial muscles. As a result, the diagnosis of Bell palsy requires special attention to forehead muscle strength. If forehead strength is preserved, a central cause of weakness should be considered.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper and lower motor neurons. Due to its rarity and rapidly progressive nature, studying the epidemiology of ALS is challenging, and a comprehensive picture of the global burden of this disease is lacking. The objective of this systematic review was to describe the global incidence and prevalence of ALS. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL to identify articles published between January 1, 2010, and May 6, 2021. Studies that were population based and reported estimates of prevalence, incidence, and/or mortality of ALS were eligible for inclusion. This study focuses on the incidence and prevalence. Quality assessment was performed using a tool developed to evaluate methodology relevant to prevalence and incidence studies. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021250559. RESULTS: This search generated 6,238 articles, of which 140 were selected for data extraction and quality assessment. Of these, 85 articles reported on the incidence and 61 on the prevalence of ALS. Incidence ranged from 0.26 per 100,000 person-years in Ecuador to 23.46 per 100,000 person-years in Japan. Point prevalence ranged from 1.57 per 100,000 in Iran to 11.80 per 100,000 in the United States. Many articles identified cases with ALS from multiple data sources. DISCUSSION: There is variation in reported incidence and prevalence estimates of ALS across the world. While registries are an important and powerful tool to quantify disease burden, such resources are not available everywhere. This results in gaps in reporting of the global epidemiology of ALS, as highlighted by the degree of variation (and quality) in estimates of incidence and prevalence reported in this review.},
