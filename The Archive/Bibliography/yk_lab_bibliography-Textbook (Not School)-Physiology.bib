  abstract = {Physiology is the foundation of medical practice. A firm grasp of its principles is essential for the medical student and the practicing physician. This book is intended for students of medicine and related disciplines who are engaged in the study of physiology. It can be used either as a companion to lectures and syllabi in discipline-based curricula or as a primary source in integrated or problem-based curricula. For advanced students, the book can serve as a reference in pathophysiology courses and in clinical clerkships. In the seventh edition of this book, as in the previous editions, the important concepts in physiology are covered at the organ system and cellular levels. Chapters 1 and 2 present the underlying principles of cellular physiology and the autonomic nervous system. Chapters 3 through 10 present the major organ systems : neurophysiology and cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, acid-base, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and reproductive physiology. The relationships between organ systems are emphasized to underscore the integrative mechanisms for homeostasis."--taken from Preface, page vi},
