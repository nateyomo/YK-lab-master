  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Congenital muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders resulting in hypotonia, muscle weakness, and dystrophic or myopathic features on muscle biopsy. This article summarizes the clinical and genetic aspects of these disorders.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Historically, diagnoses of congenital muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy have been made by clinical features and histopathology; however, recent advances in genetics have changed diagnostic practice by relying more heavily on genetic findings. This article reviews the clinical and genetic features of the most common congenital muscular dystrophies including laminin subunit alpha 2 (LAMA2)--related (merosin deficient), collagen VI--related, and {$\alpha$}-dystroglycan--related congenital muscular dystrophies and reviews the most common congenital myopathies including nemaline rod, core, and centronuclear myopathies. With the increasing accessibility of genetic testing, the number of genes found to be associated with these disorders has increased dramatically. A wide spectrum of severity and onset (from birth to adulthood) exist across all subtypes. Progression and other features are variable depending on the subtype and severity of the specific genetic mutation.                                         SUMMARY               Congenital muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy are increasingly recognized disorders. A growing appreciation for the breadth of phenotypic variability and overlap between established subtypes has challenged long-standing phenotypic and histopathologic classifications of these disorders but has driven a greater understanding of pathogenesis and opened the door to the development of novel treatments.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease that causes fluctuating weakness in ocular, bulbar, and limb muscles and can, in 15\% of cases, cause myasthenic crisis, a neurologic emergency characterized by respiratory failure. Although infrequent, MG needs to be promptly recognized and treated because the potential for improvement and remission is very high. The diagnosis of MG can be challenging and delayed because of the fluctuating nature of muscle weakness and the overlap of signs and symptoms with other neuromuscular diseases.               This article reviews the importance of prompt recognition of the typical signs and symptoms, best tests to confirm the diagnosis, currently available acute and chronic treatment modalities, the role of thymectomy, and the natural history of the disease. Special consideration related to the diagnosis and management in women during pregnancy and in children will also be reviewed. This article also includes an overview of congenital myasthenic syndromes.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent significant efforts in standardizing and improving the care of patients with MG have occurred, as well as new momentum in developing new drugs for patients with MG who do not adequately respond to currently available treatments. The number of clinical trials and drugs in development for MG is steadily increasing. Eculizumab has been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adult patients with generalized MG who are acetylcholine receptor--antibody positive, based on the REGAIN (Safety and Efficacy of Eculizumab in Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis) study, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. An international, multicenter, randomized trial comparing thymectomy plus prednisone with prednisone alone has demonstrated that thymectomy improves clinical outcome in patients with nonthymomatous MG. Clinical care guidelines have been published, and the recommendations for clinical research standards and the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America MGFA clinical classification published in 2000 have become widely accepted by the clinical and research community of MG experts.                                         SUMMARY               MG is a highly treatable disease with many effective treatment modalities available and with a natural history that continues to improve thanks to better diagnostic tests and effective drugs. The diagnosis and management of patients affected by MG can be highly rewarding for any neurologist as most patients are able to live normal lives if treated appropriately. Nevertheless, future research is needed to address unresolved clinical issues, such as when and how to discontinue immunosuppressive medications in patients in remission, the role and timing of thymectomy in children, and better treatment options for refractory patients.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article provides an overview of mitochondrial and metabolic biology, the genetic mechanisms causing mitochondrial diseases, the clinical features of mitochondrial diseases, lipid myopathies, and glycogen storage diseases, all with a focus on those syndromes and diseases associated with myopathy. Over the past decade, advances in genetic testing have revolutionized patient evaluation. The main goal of this review is to give the clinician the basic understanding to recognize patients at risk of these diseases using the standard history and physical examination.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Primary mitochondrial disease                 is the current designation for the illnesses resulting from genetic mutations in genes whose protein products are necessary for mitochondrial structure or function. In most circumstances, more than one organ system is involved in mitochondrial disease, and the value of the classic clinical features as originally described early in the history of mitochondrial diseases has reemerged as being important to identifying patients who may have a primary mitochondrial disease. The use of the genetic laboratory has become the most powerful tool for confirming a diagnosis, and nuances of using genetic results will be discussed in this article. Treatment for mitochondrial disease is symptomatic, with less emphasis on vitamin and supplement therapy than in the past. Clinical trials using pharmacologic agents are in progress, with the field attempting to define proper goals of treatment. Several standard accepted therapies exist for many of the metabolic myopathies.                                                        SUMMARY               Mitochondrial, lipid, and glycogen diseases are not uncommon causes of multisystem organ dysfunction, with the neurologic features, especially myopathy, occurring as a predominant feature. Early recognition requires basic knowledge of the varied clinical phenotypes before moving forward with a screening evaluation and possibly a genetic evaluation. Aside from a few specific diseases for which there are recommended interventions, treatment for the majority of  these disorders remains symptomatic, with clinical trials currently in progress that will hopefully result in standard treatments.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Muscle symptoms are common among statin users and are usually reversible after discontinuation of the statin; rarely, however, statins trigger an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy that persists and requires immunomodulatory therapy. Autoantibodies targeting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase can distinguish the toxic and immune-mediated forms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, increasingly used in the treatment of advanced cancer, have recently been associated with the development of inflammatory myositis. A reversible mitochondrial myopathy has long been associated with zidovudine, but recent reports elucidate the risk of myopathy with newer antivirals, such as telbivudine and raltegravir.                                         SUMMARY               The medications most commonly associated with myopathy include statins, amiodarone, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, certain antivirals, and corticosteroids, and myopathy can occur with chronic alcoholism. Certain clinical, electrodiagnostic, and histologic features can aid in early recognition. Stopping the use of the offending agent reverses symptoms in most cases, but specific and timely treatment may be required in cases related to agents that trigger immune-mediated muscle injury.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Gene therapies have become a reality for several neuromuscular disorders. Exon-skipping and (in Europe) ribosomal read-through approaches are currently available to a subset of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Microdystrophin gene replacement has shown promise and is nearing the final stages of clinical trials. Numerous gene-based therapies for other muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are progressing toward approval as well.                                         SUMMARY               Muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are a heterogenous group of hereditary muscle disorders. Confirming a diagnosis with genetic testing is not only critical for guiding management, but also an actual prerequisite for current and future gene therapies. Recessive loss-of-function or dominant haploinsufficiency disorders may be treated with gene replacement strategies, whereas dominant negative and toxic gain-of-function disorders are best addressed with a variety of knockdown approaches. It is important to recognize that many therapeutics are mutation specific and will only benefit a subset of individuals with a specific disease.},

RECENT FINDINGS               IBM is an often-misdiagnosed myopathy subtype. Due to the insidious onset and slow progression of muscle weakness, it can often be dismissed as a sign of aging as it commonly presents in older adults. While challenging to recognize upon initial clinical evaluation, the recent recognition of specialized stains highlighting features seen on muscle pathology, the use of diagnostic tools such as the anti-cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A antibody biomarker, and the ability of muscle imaging to detect patterns of preferential muscle involvement seen in IBM has allowed for earlier diagnosis of the disease than was previously possible. While the pathogenesis of IBM has historically been poorly understood, several ongoing studies point toward mechanisms of autophagy and highly differentiated cytotoxic T cells that are postulated to be pathogenic in IBM.

RECENT FINDINGS               The suspicion that LEMS is rare but also likely underdiagnosed is supported by recent epidemiologic data. A validated, LEMS-specific scale now exists to assess and monitor disease, and symptomatic and immunomodulatory treatments are available. As presynaptic disorders of neuromuscular transmission, LEMS and botulism share electrodiagnostic abnormalities but have important distinguishing features. Knowledge of the clinical features of botulism is needed, particularly with continued cases of infant botulism, the opioid epidemic increasing the incidence of wound botulism, and medical use of botulinum toxin, which may cause iatrogenic botulism. Foodborne botulism remains rare. Prompt recognition of botulism and administration of antitoxin can improve outcomes. MG may be exacerbated or may present de novo in the context of immune activation from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies for cancer. Immune-related MG commonly overlaps with myositis and myocarditis. Corticosteroids typically result in improvement. However, immune-related MG can be more fulminant than its idiopathic counterpart and may cause permanent disability or death.

Early diagnosis and carefully selected treatment not only improve outcomes of the neuromuscular disease but can affect the prognosis of underlying malignancy, when present.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Patients with MG can be classified based on antibody status and their clinical presentation; treatment responses may differ based on disease subtypes. Improved diagnostic methods and recognition of new antigenic targets such as lipoprotein-related protein 4 have led to improved diagnostic efficiencies. Corticosteroids remain the first-line immunotherapy, but there is a trend toward minimizing their use at high doses and for long durations. Oral immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and tacrolimus remain useful. An international, multicenter randomized trial comparing thymectomy plus prednisone with prednisone alone demonstrated that thymectomy improves clinical outcomes in selected patients with nonthymomatous MG. Eculizumab, efgartigimod, and ravulizumab have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adult patients with generalized MG who are acetylcholine receptor--antibody positive. These drugs take advantage of novel mechanisms of action and expand treatment options for patients with MG.

The LGMDs include disorders with autosomal recessive inheritance, which are often due to loss-of-function mutations in muscle structural or repair proteins and typically have younger ages of onset and more rapidly progressive presentations, and those with autosomal dominant inheritance, which can have older ages of presentation and chronic progressive disease courses. All cause progressive disability and potential loss of ability to walk or maintain a job due to progressive muscle wasting. Certain mutations are associated with cardiac or respiratory involvement. No disease-altering therapies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for LGMDs and standard treatment uses a multidisciplinary clinic model, but recessive LGMDs are potentially amenable to systemic gene replacement therapies, which are already being tested in clinical trials for sarcoglycan and                 FKRP                 mutations. The dominant LGMDs may be amenable to RNA-based therapeutic approaches.                                                        SUMMARY               International efforts are underway to better characterize LGMDs, help resolve variants of uncertain significance, provide consistent and improved standards of care, and prepare for future clinical trials.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                FSHD has a wide range of severity, yet a distinct phenotype characterized by weakness of the facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles, followed by weakness of the trunk and leg muscles. It can be caused by two genetic mechanisms that share a common downstream pathway, namely, the epigenetic derepression and subsequent misexpression of the myotoxic                 DUX4                 transcription factor. Treatment is currently supportive and outlined in evidence-based guidelines. Advances in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of FSHD are paving the way for targeted therapy development. Approaches for targeted therapies to reduce                 DUX4                 expression that are currently being explored include small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, vector-based RNA interference, and gene therapy. In anticipation of more clinical trials, ``clinical trial preparedness,'' including the development of sensitive biomarkers and clinical outcome measures, are needed.                                                        SUMMARY               The cornerstones of the diagnosis of FSHD are clinical observation and genetic testing.

This article provides a diagnostic approach based on clinical history and neurologic examination leading to a narrow set of diagnostic tests.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Numerous discoveries in recent years have facilitated clinician access to more advanced laboratory and genetic testing to pinpoint the exact diagnosis in patients with muscle or neuromuscular junction disorders. Large-scale genetic testing has become much less expensive, and free testing has become available for many of the rare conditions because of increased research and the availability of effective therapies for these rare disorders.                                         SUMMARY               The approach to muscle and neuromuscular junction disorders depends on the clinical pattern of muscle weakness. By classifying patients into one of 10 muscle patterns, diagnostic testing can be targeted and gene testing yield will be optimized. With the increased accessibility and reduced cost of genetic testing (eg, gene panels, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, and chromosomal microarray), this clinical approach to muscle weakness and targeted gene testing will ensure a cost-effective investigational plan. This clinical approach should also assist clinicians in making a timely and accurate diagnosis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Therapy for LEMS has seen significant advances in recent years due to the approval of amifampridine-based compounds. LEMS is likely still underdiagnosed, particularly when no underlying malignancy is identified. Clinicians must have a strong suspicion for LEMS in any patient presenting with proximal weakness and autonomic dysfunction. Botulism is another rare disorder of presynaptic neuromuscular transmission that is most commonly associated with improper storage or preservation of food products. Over the past 2 decades, wound botulism has been increasingly reported among users of black tar heroin. A high degree of clinical suspicion and electrodiagnostic studies can be beneficial in distinguishing botulism from other acute neurologic disorders, and early involvement of state and federal health authorities may assist in confirming the diagnosis and obtaining treatment. When botulism is suspected, electrodiagnostic studies can provide clinical evidence of disordered neuromuscular transmission in advance of serologic confirmation, and providers should not wait for confirmation of the diagnosis to initiate treatment.                                         SUMMARY               A targeted clinical history and a thorough neurologic examination with support from serologic and electrodiagnostic studies are key to early diagnosis of LEMS and botulism. Early diagnosis of both conditions creates opportunities for therapy and improves outcomes.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Impairments in glycogenolysis/glycolysis (glycogen storage disease), fatty acid transport/oxidation (fatty acid oxidation defects), and mitochondrial metabolism (mitochondrial myopathies) represent most metabolic myopathies; however, they often overlap clinically with structural genetic myopathies, referred to as pseudometabolic myopathies. Although metabolic myopathies can present in the neonatal period with hypotonia, hypoglycemia, and encephalopathy, most cases present clinically in children or young adults with exercise intolerance, rhabdomyolysis, and weakness. In general, the glycogen storage diseases manifest during brief bouts of high-intensity exercise; in contrast, fatty acid oxidation defects and mitochondrial myopathies usually manifest during longer-duration endurance-type activities, often with fasting or other metabolic stressors (eg, surgery, fever). The neurologic examination is often normal between events (except in the pseudometabolic myopathies) and evaluation requires one or more of the following tests: exercise stress testing, blood (eg, creatine kinase, acylcarnitine profile, lactate, amino acids), urine (eg, organic acids, myoglobin), muscle biopsy (eg, histology, ultrastructure, enzyme testing), and targeted (specific gene) or untargeted (myopathy panels) genetic tests.

This article reviews the phenotype and pathophysiology of the disease as well as the recent efforts in clinical outcome measures and clinical trials.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                As the name implies, FSHD involves weakness of facial muscles, muscles that fix the scapula, and muscles overlying the humerus (biceps and triceps). The distinctive phenotype of FSHD occurs secondary to two different genetic mechanisms. FSHD type 1 (FSHD1) is due to a deletion on chromosome 4q, leading to hypomethylation and derepression of                 DUX4                 . FSHD type 2 (FSHD2) is due to mutations in                 SMCHD1                 with resulting hypomethylation of the same subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q and derepression of                 DUX4                 . Understanding the central role of                 DUX4                 has opened up the possibility of disease-modifying treatments. In preparation for clinical trials of novel agents, researchers are in the process of validating a number of clinical trial outcome measures including MRI, the 6-minute walk test, the FSHD Composite Outcome Measure, reachable workspace, electrical impedance myography, and the FSHD Health Index.                                                        SUMMARY               The treatment of FSHD is currently supportive only. While past clinical trials in FSHD have been largely disappointing, novel agents in development, including antisense oligonucleotides, gene therapy, and small molecules, hold promise for future meaningful therapies.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article reviews the clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic features of sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) and explores its pathogenic overlap with inherited myopathies that have IBM-like pathology.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Sporadic IBM is the most common acquired muscle disease in patients older than 50 years of age and is becoming more prevalent because of the increasing age of the population, the emerging development of more inclusive diagnostic criteria, and the advent of a diagnostic autoantibody. No effective therapy is known, and the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. Some pathogenic insight can be gleaned from other myopathies with pathologic similarities or hereditary inclusion body myopathies. Although clinically distinct from sporadic IBM, preclinical models of hereditary inclusion body myopathy have offered an opportunity to move some therapies toward clinical development.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with sporadic IBM experience significant morbidity, and the disease is associated with a large unmet medical need. As therapies are developed, improved diagnosis will be essential. Early diagnosis relies on awareness, clinical history, physical examination, laboratory features, and appropriate muscle biopsy processing. Future research is needed to understand the natural history, identify genetic risk factors, and validate biomarkers to track disease progression. These steps are essential as we move toward therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            purpose of review               As a group, the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are the fourth most prevalent genetic muscle disease, yet they are still not well known or understood. This article defines and describes LGMDs, delineates a diagnostic strategy, and discusses treatment of the LGMDs.                                         recent findings               In 2018, the definition of the LGMDs was further refined, and a new nomenclature was proposed. Diagnosis of the LGMDs was long guided by the distinctive clinical characteristics of each particular subtype but now integrates use of genetics---with next-generation sequencing panels, exomes, and full genome analysis---early in the diagnostic assessment. Appreciation of the phenotypic diversity of each LGMD subtype continues to expand. This emphasizes the need for precision genetic diagnostics to better understand each subtype and formulate appropriate management for individual patients. Of significant relevance, the explosion of research into therapeutic options accentuates the need for accurate diagnosis, comprehensive disease characterization, and description of the natural histories of the LGMDs to move the field forward and to mitigate disease impact on patients with LGMD.                                         summary               The LGMDs are genetic muscle diseases that superficially appear similar to one another but have important differences in rates of progression and concomitant comorbidities. Definitive diagnoses are crucial to guide management and treatment now and in the future. As targeted treatments emerge, it will be important for clinicians to understand the nomenclature, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and treatments of the LGMDs.},
