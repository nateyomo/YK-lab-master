  abstract = {"The Bonica text is heavy on science. A thorough update is warranted considering work on the fourth edition began in 2007 and there's been no break in research in the interim. Pain Medicine is practiced in several medical specialties; the ABMS recognizes it as a subspecialty of Anesthesiology, Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Psychiatry and Neurology, and Radiology. Management of Pain is also researched and practiced by physical therapists and psychologists (two disciplines not recognized by the ABMS). This diffuse assortment of researchers and practitioners author the chapters and purchase the book"--},

  address = {Adelaide, Australia},
  abstract = {All pain is real. And for many people it is a debilitating part of everyday life. It is now known that understanding more about why things hurt can actually help people to overcome their pain. Recent advances in fields such as neurophysiology, brain imaging, immunology, psychology and cellular biology have provided an explanatory platform from which to explore pain. This book discusses how pain responses are produced by the brain; how responses to injury from the autonomic motor and immune systems in your body contribute to pain, and why pain can persist after tissues have had plenty of time to heal. This book, with its easy to follow language, discusses how pain experiences are constructed in response to dangers and threats in our bodies and influenced by our thoughts, beliefs and context. This knowledge is the key to recovery},
