  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low testosterone (T) levels in men associate with increased risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. However, most studies are cross-sectional with follow-up-time {$<$}10 years, and data on early growth are limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare prenatal factors and body mass index (BMI) development from birth to age 46 in relation to low T at age 31. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Men with low T (T{$<$}12.1nmol/l, n = 132) and men with normal T at age 31 (n = 2561) were derived from the Northern Finland birth cohort 1966. Prenatal factors, longitudinal weight and height data from birth to age 14, and cross-sectional weight and height data at ages 31 and 46, and waist-hip-ratio (WHR) and T levels at age 31 were analysed. Longitudinal modelling and timing of adiposity rebound (AR, second BMI rise at age 5-7 years) were calculated from fitted BMI curves. Results were adjusted for mother's pre-pregnancy BMI and smoking status, birth weight for gestational age, alcohol consumption, education level, smoking status and WHR at age 31. RESULTS: Neither gestational age nor birth weight was associated with low T at age 31, however maternal obesity during gestation was more prevalent among men with low T (9.8\% vs 3.5\%, adjusted aOR: 2.43 (1.19-4.98)). Men with low T had earlier AR (5.28 vs 5.82, aOR: 0.73 (0.56-0.94)) and higher BMI (P{$<$}.001) from AR onwards until age 46. Men with both early AR and low T had the highest BMI from AR onwards. CONCLUSIONS: In men, maternal obesity and early weight gain associate with lower T levels at age 31, independently of adulthood abdominal obesity. Given the well-known health risks related to obesity, and the rising prevalence of maternal obesity, the results of the present study emphasize the importance of preventing obesity that may affect also later reproductive health of the offspring.
