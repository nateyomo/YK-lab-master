  abstract = {"The third edition of Neuroanatomy through Clinical Cases is written for first- or second-year medical students enrolled in a basic neuroanatomy, neurobiology, or neuroscience course. It is also a valuable resource for advanced medical students and residents, as well as students of other health professions ranging from physical therapy to dentistry. This book brings a pioneering interactive approach to the teaching of neuroanatomy and comprises 19 chapters that explain the major neuroanatomical systems. Each chapter first presents background material-including an overview of relevant neuroanatomical structures and pathways-and a brief discussion of related clinical disorders. The second half of each chapter is devoted to clinical cases. The cases begin with a narrative of how the patient developed symptoms and what deficits were found on neurological examination. A series of questions challenges the reader to deduce the neuroanatomical location of the patient's lesion and the diagnosis. Discussion and answers follow, revealing the actual outcome. This third edition is fully updated with the latest advances in the field and includes several new cases and enhanced online and digital components"},

Since the publication of the first edition in 2009, new methodologies have made consciousness much more accessible scientifically. In particular, the study of disorders, disruptions, and disturbances of consciousness has added tremendously to our understanding of the biological basis of human consciousness. The publication of a new edition is both critical and timely for continued understanding of the field of consciousness. In this update, revised and new contributions by internationally renowned researchers, edited by the leaders in the field of consciousness research, provide a unique and comprehensive focus on human consciousness."--Back cover},
