  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Syncope is a prevalent syndrome with diverse causes, which have in common a sudden transient failure of the autonomic nervous system to maintain blood pressure against the force of gravity at a level sufficient for cerebral perfusion. Neurally mediated syncope is an episodic phenomenon in which autonomic nervous system function is normal the rest of the time. Although relatively benign, syncope increases the risk for injury from falling and can substantially impair patients' quality of life. Recognition of its various clinical presentations and knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology are essential for accurate diagnosis and successful management.                                         Recent Findings:               The most effective forms of treatment remain education of patients, avoidance of triggers, physical counterpressure maneuvers, and hydration or intravascular volume expansion. Pharmacologic interventions may be appropriate for some patients but, in general, have limited evidence of efficacy in preventing syncope. Based on the findings of a recent study, the possibility of pulmonary embolism should be considered in patients hospitalized for syncope, whether or not an alternative etiology for syncope is identified.                                         Summary:               This article focuses on the neurologic diagnosis, differential diagnosis, physiology, and management strategies for syncope, with an emphasis on neurally mediated syncope.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Although trigeminal neuralgia is well known to neurologists, recent developments in classification and clinical diagnosis, new MRI methods, and  a debate about surgical options necessitate an update on the topic.                                         Recent Findings:               Currently, a worldwide controversy exists regarding the classification, diagnostic process, and surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. This controversy has been caused on one side by the recognition that some 50\% of patients with trigeminal neuralgia, apart from characteristic paroxysmal attacks, also have continuous pain in the same territory, which results in greater diagnostic difficulties and is associated with a lower response to medical and surgical treatments. In contrast, recent developments in MRI methods allow differentiation between a mere neurovascular contact and an effective compression of the trigeminal root by an anomalous vessel, which implies more difficulties in the choice of surgical treatment, with the indication for microvascular decompression becoming more restricted.                                         Summary:               This article proposes that the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia, with or without concomitant continuous pain, must rely on clinical grounds only. Diagnostic tests are necessary to distinguish three etiologic categories: idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (nothing is found), classic trigeminal neuralgia (an anomalous vessel produces morphologic changes of the trigeminal root near its entry into the pons), and secondary trigeminal neuralgia (due to major neurologic disease, such as multiple sclerosis or tumors at the cerebellopontine angle). Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine (ie, voltage-gated, frequency-dependent sodium channel blockers) are still the first-choice medical treatment, although many patients experience significant side effects, and those with concomitant continuous pain respond less well to treatment. The development of sodium channel blockers that are selective for the sodium channel 1.7 (Na               v               1.7) receptor will hopefully help. Although all the surgical interventions (percutaneous ganglion lesions, gamma knife radiosurgery, and microvascular decompression) are very efficacious, precise MRI criteria for differentiating a real neurovascular compression from an irrelevant contact will be of benefit in better selecting patients for microvascular decompression.},

These disorders commonly occur in head trauma, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases such as idiopathic Parkinson disease and dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer disease, just to name a few. This article covers the basic anatomy of smell and taste, notes the important points of taking a proper history, and discusses smell and taste testing, which are inexpensive, minimally time-consuming procedures. Recurrent bad smells and tastes are not uncommon in these disorders, which cause major impairment in quality of life, including loss of appetite, decreased eating, and weight loss. The diagnosis and treatment of these disorders will also be discussed.                                         Recent Findings:               Despite past widespread negative prognoses of taste and smell disorders, more recent work in the last 10 years has shown an improved prognosis for smell and taste recovery in most disorders, and recommendations for changes in food preparation have helped many patients enjoy their food and increase their appetite. Recent experimental evidence has shown that smell loss and testing can assist in separating idiopathic Parkinson disease from other parkinsonian syndromes, can suggest which patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder will more likely develop Parkinson disease, and can be predictive of the progression of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer dementia.                                         Summary:               This article discusses the common smell and taste disorders that a clinical neurologist will encounter in practice. The anatomy and function of smell and taste will be reviewed, followed by office evaluation and testing. The common disorders will be reviewed, along with their prognosis and management.},

Recent Findings:               Improved methods of diagnosing patients with vertigo and dizziness have been evolving, including additional diagnostic criteria and characterization of some common conditions that cause dizziness (eg, vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, chronic subjective dizziness). Other uncommon causes of dizziness (eg, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, episodic ataxia type 2) have also been better clarified. Distinguishing between central and peripheral causes of vertigo can be accomplished reliably through history and examination, but imaging techniques have further added to accuracy. What has not changed is the necessity of obtaining a basic history of the patient's symptoms to narrow the list of possible causes.                                         Summary:               Dizziness and vertigo are extremely common symptoms that also affect function at home and at work. Improvements in the diagnosis and management of the syndromes that cause dizziness and vertigo will enhance patient care and cost efficiencies in a health care system with limited resources. Clinicians who evaluate patients with dizziness will serve their patient population well by continuing to manage patients with well-focused workup and attentive care.},

Recent Findings:               Entrapment neuropathies are a common issue in general neurology practice. Early diagnosis and effective management of entrapment mononeuropathies are essential in preserving limb function and maintaining patient quality of life. Median neuropathy at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome), ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, radial neuropathy at the spiral groove, and fibular neuropathy at the fibular head are among the most frequently encountered entrapment mononeuropathies. Electrodiagnostic studies and peripheral nerve ultrasound are employed to help confirm the clinical diagnosis of nerve compression or entrapment and to provide precise localization for nerve injury. Peripheral nerve ultrasound demonstrates nerve enlargement at or near sites of compression.                                         Summary:               Entrapment neuropathies are commonly encountered in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and effective management require knowledge of peripheral neuroanatomy and recognition of key clinical symptoms and findings.

This article presents an up-to-date summary of the clinical presentation, investigations, and treatment options for urogenital dysfunction in patients with neurologic disease.                                         Recent Findings:               The pattern of lower urinary tract dysfunction is influenced by the site of the neurologic lesion. The risk for developing upper urinary tract damage is considerably less in patients with slowly progressive nontraumatic neurologic disorders, as compared to those with spinal cord injury or spina bifida. Investigations such as urinalysis, ultrasonography, and urodynamics provide further information about the cause and nature of lower urinary tract dysfunction. Antimuscarinic agents are the first-line management of urinary incontinence; however, side effect profile and anticholinergic burden should be considered when prescribing medications. {$\beta$}               3               -Adrenergic receptor agonists are a promising alternative oral medication. Tibial and sacral neuromodulation have been shown to be effective for managing incontinence, as well as urinary retention due to Fowler syndrome. Intradetrusor injections of onabotulinumtoxinA have revolutionized the management of neurogenic detrusor overactivity.

Recognition and management of Bell's palsy relies on knowledge of the anatomy and function of the various motor and nonmotor components of the facial nerve. Avoiding diagnostic pitfalls relies on recognizing red flags or features atypical for Bell's palsy, suggesting an alternative cause of peripheral facial palsy.                                         Recent Findings:               The first American Academy of Neurology (AAN) evidence-based review on the treatment of Bell's palsy in 2001 concluded that corticosteroids were probably effective and that the antiviral acyclovir was possibly effective in increasing the likelihood of a complete recovery from Bell's palsy. Subsequent studies led to a revision of these recommendations in the 2012 evidence-based review, concluding that corticosteroids, when used shortly after the onset of Bell's palsy, were ``highly likely'' to increase the probability of recovery of facial weakness and should be offered; the addition of an antiviral to steroids may increase the likelihood of recovery but, if so, only by a very modest effect.                                         Summary:               Bell's palsy is characterized by the spontaneous acute onset of unilateral peripheral facial paresis or palsy in isolation, meaning that no features from the history, neurologic examination, or head and neck examination suggest a specific or alternative cause. In this setting, no further testing is necessary. Even without treatment, the outcome of Bell's palsy is favorable, but treatment with corticosteroids significantly increases the likelihood of improvement.},

Recent Findings:               As most cases of acute low back pain have a favorable prognosis, current guidelines on imaging studies recommend conservative treatment for 6 weeks prior to obtaining an MRI if no red flags are present. Of these red flags, a prior history of cancer is the strongest risk factor for a malignant etiology and requires urgent evaluation with MRI. Management of acute low back pain is mainly conservative with oral non-narcotic analgesics and mobilization as the initial recommendations. For patients with radiculopathy, epidural steroids may result in short-term pain relief, but long-term effects are still unclear.

Several medications have been shown to be effective in treating neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, and these medications are often used to treat neuropathic pain associated with other conditions as well. This article summarizes the diagnosis and assessment of patients with neuropathic pain as well as available pharmacologic and interventional treatment options.                                         Recent Findings:               Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of neuropathic pain have been published, and first-line medications include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, topical agents, as well as opioid analgesics. Interventional options include anesthetic and steroid injections, nerve blocks, and spinal cord stimulation. Essential to the treatment algorithm of neuropathic pain is the assessment and treatment of psychosocial comorbidities and the utilization of a multidisciplinary team approach, including cognitive-behavioral and rehabilitative therapies. Questions remain about the comparative effectiveness of various medications and combination therapies. Increasing interest also exists in the optimization and personalization of pharmacotherapy based upon the underlying mechanism(s) of neuropathic pain according to the quality of the patient's symptoms.                                         Summary:               The management of chronic neuropathic pain is challenging and is best achieved with the use of a multidisciplinary team. Pain is a subjective experience, and it is important to validate a patient's pain, address psychosocial comorbidities, and set realistic treatment goals.
