  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently available hand-held dynamometers (HHD) offer a more objective and reliable assessment of muscle force production as compared to a manual muscle test (MMT). Yet, their clinical utility is limited due to high cost. The ActivForce (AF) digital dynamometer is a new low-cost HHD with unknown psychometric properties, and its utilization may benefit clinical practice. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the AF intra- and inter-tester reliabilities, standard error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), and criterion validity for assessing shoulder isometric force as compared to the microFET2 (MF2) across testers with different experiences. DESIGN: Descriptive observational study. METHODS: A convenience sample of 29 healthy adults were assessed twice by each of three testers (two experienced clinicians and a novice PT student) on shoulder external rotation (ER), internal rotation (IR), and forward elevation (FE) using both the AF and MF2 devices. Tester, HHD, and shoulder motion assignment orders were randomized. All testing was performed in a standardized seated position. ER and IR were tested with the shoulder fully adducted. FE was tested at 45{$^\circ$} at the scapular plane. All testing and rest periods between testers and tested motions were standardized and monitored via a stopwatch. RESULTS: Both devices had high intra- [~ER (.95-.98), IR (.97 - .99), FE (.96 - .99)] and inter-tester [~ER (.85-.96), IR (.95 - .97), FE (.88 - .95)] intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with comparable intra- (1.68-1.80) and inter-tester (2.36-2.98) SEM, and intra- (4.64-4.97) and inter-tester (6.50-8.24) MDC values across all motions. Tester experience did not affect these values. High (.89-.93) statistically significant Pearson correlations were found between HHDs for all shoulder motions. CONCLUSION: Both the AF and MF2 HHDs were found to have high reliability levels across all shoulder motions regardless of tester clinical experience. The AF was also found to be valid for measuring shoulder isometric force production compared to the criterion standard device, the MF2. Its low-cost and electronic accessibility features may promote better compliance for clinicians using dynamometry to objectively assess and store muscle force data in a cost-effective manner.

  abstract = {Isometric force- or torque-time parameters are commonly reported in the research literature. The processing methods of the electronic dynamometer-derived signal may influence the outcome measures. This study determined the influence of filtering and sample rate (SR) on isometric torque-time parameters and provides specific signal processing recommendations for future studies. Twenty-three subjects performed 49 isometric maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the knee extensors on an isokinetic dynamometer. Outcome measures included peak torque (PT), and rate of torque development at peak (RTDPEAK), 50 (RTD50) and 200\,(RTD200) ms for seven filter conditions including low-pass filter cutoffs at 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 150\,Hz and a notch filter at 100 and 200\,Hz. Comparisons were also made across four SR conditions at 100, 500, 1000 and 2000\,Hz. The RTDPEAK variable was markedly changed (-5.4 to -37.9\%) for all filter frequencies compared to the 150\,Hz condition and the RTD50 variable was altered for all frequencies between 50 and 5\,Hz. No differences were found for RTD200. For SR, compared to the 2000\,Hz condition, differences were revealed for the 100\,Hz condition for the RTDPEAK and RTD50 variables. The filtering or SR did not alter PT across any of the conditions. The filter and SR applied to the signal was capable of distorting the MVC signal and skewing the torque-time parameters, specifically for the early and maximum RTD variables of the MVC curve (RTD50 and RTDPEAK). For traditional isokinetic dynamometers, a low-pass filter cutoff of 150\,Hz and a SR of at least 1000\,Hz is recommended when assessing early isometric force- or torque-time MVC parameters.},

  abstract = {Isokinetics is a proven method to train and objectively assess the capability of muscle groups, particularly at the knee. The current re-injury rates and less than optimal return to sport percentages seen following anterior cruciate ligament surgery highlights the need for greater focus on what tests and methods are used to make these critical decisions. Isokinetics remains the best single method to objectively determine dynamic muscle strength, power, rate of force development and endurance. These factors make it well-suited to play a crucial role in influencing the appropriate patient progression through a rehabilitation program and assisting in determining return to play readiness following injury or surgery. In this article we will discuss why we believe isokinetics is a useful and necessary testing method, and elucidate testing parameters and goals used during knee extension/flexion assessment.},
