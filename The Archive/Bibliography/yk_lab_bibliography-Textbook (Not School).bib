It is now known that understanding more about why things hurt can actually help people to overcome their pain. Recent advances in fields such as neurophysiology, brain imaging, immunology, psychology and cellular biology have provided an explanatory platform from which to explore pain. This book discusses how pain responses are produced by the brain; how responses to injury from the autonomic motor and immune systems in your body contribute to pain, and why pain can persist after tissues have had plenty of time to heal. This book, with its easy to follow language, discusses how pain experiences are constructed in response to dangers and threats in our bodies and influenced by our thoughts, beliefs and context.

  abstract = {Principles of Power explains the physics behind the hardest hitting fighters in history, then demonstrates practical ways to incorporate these principles into your own striking arsenal in an easy to understand, no nonsense way. For years sports scientists have studied how to put the most power into movement patterns from popular sports; from a pitcher throwing a baseball to a golfer swinging his golf club. This same attention has rarely been given to combat sports or martial arts, in part because a fighter must balance mobility and defense along with power generation. But the lack of research has not stopped generations of talented fighters of all disciplines from finding ways to incorporate massive power building techniques into their own unique styles. This book not only explains the physics behind massive power generation, it also gives hundreds of examples of how to use them. Each physics principle is followed with a Practical Applications section. This section demonstrates several proven set ups and techniques used by the world's greatest fighters, from simple, staple techniques to complex, advanced methods. In this way, the reader can incorporate the principles in a way that works best for their own unique style.},

For advanced students, the book can serve as a reference in pathophysiology courses and in clinical clerkships. In the seventh edition of this book, as in the previous editions, the important concepts in physiology are covered at the organ system and cellular levels. Chapters 1 and 2 present the underlying principles of cellular physiology and the autonomic nervous system. Chapters 3 through 10 present the major organ systems : neurophysiology and cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, acid-base, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and reproductive physiology. The relationships between organ systems are emphasized to underscore the integrative mechanisms for homeostasis."--taken from Preface, page vi},

Although medications may ease suffering for some, in Change Your Diet, Change Your Mind, Dr. Georgia Ede argues that the most powerful way to change brain chemistry is with food, because what we eat is where our brain's chemicals come from. For years, we've been told the way to protect our brains is through superfoods and supplements--we top our oatmeal with blueberries, choose plant-based patties over hamburgers, and wash down handfuls of supplements with green smoothies. But the science says: not only do these strategies fail people, but they can also work against them. The truth about brain food is that meat is not dangerous, vegan diets are not healthier, and antioxidants will not help you. In this provocative, illuminating book, Dr. Ede explains why everything we think we know about eating for neurological psychological well-being is wrong. Most of what we accept as true is based on studies that take an "outside-in" approach, making associations between healthy people and what they eat. In her book, Dr. Ede takes an inside-out stance, drawing on a range of disciplines like biochemistry, neuroscience, and botany to explain why a ketogenic diet combined with "kinder, gentler plant foods" is the best way to nourish, protect, and energize the brain"--},

Each chapter reviews epidemiology, anatomy, mechanism of injury, clinical evaluation, imaging (which includes the formal classification systems used to name and grade fracture types), non-operative and operative treatment, and complications. This title is an almost obligatory purchase for first-year orthopaedic residents, and is also purchased in substantial numbers by other specialties involved in fracture care, including Pas and NPs in either orthopaedic or emergency medicine settings. It is very simply written, and many of the illustrations are derived from the Rockwood and Green franchise. Importantly, this title covers adult and pediatric fractures, and is thus usable in primary care, especially family practice settings"-- Provided by publisher},

Key Features: Each chapter details the techniques and pitfalls of a surgical approach, gives a clear preview of anatomic landmarks and incisions, and highlights potential dangers of superficial and deep dissection; Updates of existing surgical approaches include expanded approaches for emergency decompression of a compartment syndrome of the lower leg and forearm, as well as the addition of a classic approach to fixation of distal radial fractures; New coverage of the posterior and postero-lateral approaches to the tibial plateau, surgical dislocation of the hip, a minimally invasive anterior approach to the hip joint, and the lateral approach to the metatarso phalangeal joint of the hallux; Revisions include clear depictions of the iliopectinal fascia and the step technique for the flip osteotomy of the greater trochanter. -- Publisher},

In addition to the bone, joint, and soft tissue injuries incurred in sports, physical therapists are seeing more and more traumas associated with aging and with high-speed accidents. This great variety of injury types increases the complexity of treatment. Moreover, in recent years there has been a growing demand for the most complete restoration possible of both physical and psychological function. This is the principal objective of aftercare. Accordingly, this book focuses on a comprehensive presentation of individual injuries and their effect on function, as well as the guidelines and potential results of physical therapy treatment. It is addressed to students, practitioners, and teachers of physical therapy who must master and apply an understanding of the whole range of injuries, their consequences, and their treatment.

  abstract = {"Now in a fully rewritten fourth edition, this is the authoritative presentation of motivational interviewing (MI), the powerful approach to facilitating change. It has been updated and streamlined to be even more user-friendly as a practitioner guide and course text. MI originators William R. Miller and Stephen Rollnick elucidate the four tasks of MI--engaging, focusing, evoking, and planning--and vividly demonstrate what they look like in action. A wealth of vignettes and interview examples illustrate the dos and don'ts of successful implementation in diverse contexts. The book reviews the evidence base for the approach and covers ways to assess the quality of MI. The companion website provides reflection questions, annotated case material, and additional helpful resources. New to This Edition *Most of the book is entirely new. *Addresses the breadth of MI applications not only in counseling and psychotherapy, but also in health care, education, coaching, management, and other contexts. *Discusses delivering MI remotely, simple versus complex affirmations, strategic use of directional questions, ethical considerations, and other new or expanded topics. *Increased emphasis on using MI throughout a client's process of change and growth, not just in the preparatory stage. Pedagogical Features *New or updated online materials, including reflection questions and annotated cases. *Key points at the end of each chapter. *"Personal Perspective" and "For Therapists" boxes in every chapter. *Extended bibliography and quick-reference glossary. *New self-assessment tool that targets the component skills of MI. This book is in the Applications of Motivational Interviewing series, edited by Stephen Rollnick, William R. Miller, and Theresa B. Moyers. "--},

  abstract = {"Every student will be affected by pregnancy, either their mother's, because what happens in the womb does not necessarily stay in the womb, or by someone else's. As health care professionals, you will often encounter women of childbearing age who may be pregnant, or you may have children of your own, or maybe it is a friend who is pregnant. In any case, pregnancy and childbirth are relevant to all of us, and unfortunately, these processes often culminate in negative outcomes. For example, 50\% of all embryos are spontaneously aborted. Furthermore, prematurity and birth defects are the leading causes of infant mortality and major contributors to disabilities. Fortunately, new strategies can improve pregnancy outcomes, and health care professionals have a major role to play in implementing these initiatives. However, a basic knowledge of embryology is essential to the success of these strategies, and with this knowledge, every health care professional can play a role in providing healthier babies. To accomplish its goal of providing a basic understanding of embryology and its clinical relevance, Langman's Medical Embryology retains its unique approach of combining an economy of text with excellent diagrams and clinical images. It stresses the clinical importance of the subject by providing numerous clinical examples that result from abnormal embryological events. The following pedagogic features and updates in the 14th edition help facilitate student learning"--},

These high-quality case studies cover all the body systems and detail conditions including chronic, neurological, oncologic, and traumatic, which closely mirror cases seen in clinical practice. Each case study includes extensive medical data from an interprofessional team, imaging/diagnostic tests, social history, and physical therapy information.

  abstract = {"The third edition of Manual of Traumatic Brain Injury offers a thorough revision of the popular evidence-based guide to understanding and managing all levels of traumatic brain injury. Comprehensive in scope and concise in format, this reference describes the spectrum of injury from mild to severe and the continuum of care from initial injury to management of chronic sequelae. Chapters are designed with a practical clinical focus, for targeted retrieval of content by topic area and self-review. The text is organized into five sections. Part I addresses fundamental concepts necessary for understanding the underpinning of clinical decision-making. Part II is dedicated to mild TBI, including sport-related concussion, with chapters covering topics from natural history to associated somatic disorders, post-concussion syndrome, and PTSD. Part III covers moderate to severe TBI and details prehospital emergency and ICU care, rehabilitation, treatment of related conditions, and postinjury outcomes. Part IV focuses on TBI-related complications, including posttraumatic seizures, spasticity, behavioral and sleep disturbances, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Part V reviews special considerations in selected populations such as pediatric TBI and TBI in the military, as well as medicolegal and ethical considerations in TBI, complementary and alternative medicine, and return to work considerations. Each chapter includes boxed Key Points which underscore major clinical takeaways, Study Questions to facilitate self-assessment and further emphasize core chapter content, and an Additional Reading list for a deeper dive into chapter concepts. Significant updates incorporating recent advancements in the field, combined with the clinical acumen of its experienced contributors, make this third edition the essential manual for healthcare professionals caring for individuals with traumatic brain injury"--},
