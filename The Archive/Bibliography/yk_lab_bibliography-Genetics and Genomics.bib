  abstract = {Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR{$\gamma$}) is a type II nuclear receptor, initially recognized in adipose tissue for its role in fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism. It promotes lipid uptake and adipogenesis by increasing insulin sensitivity and adiponectin release. Later, PPAR{$\gamma$} was implicated in cardiac development and in critical conditions such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and kidney failure. Recently, a cluster of different papers linked PPAR{$\gamma$} signaling with another superfamily, the transforming growth factor beta (TGF{$\beta$}), and its receptors, all of which play a major role in PAH and kidney failure. TGF{$\beta$} is a multifunctional cytokine that drives inflammation, fibrosis, and cell differentiation while PPAR{$\gamma$} activation reverses these adverse events in many models. Such opposite biological effects emphasize the delicate balance and complex crosstalk between PPAR{$\gamma$} and TGF{$\beta$}. Based on solid experimental and clinical evidence, the present review summarizes connections and their implications for PAH and kidney failure, highlighting the similarities and differences between lung and kidney mechanisms as well as discussing the therapeutic potential of PPAR{$\gamma$} agonist pioglitazone.},
