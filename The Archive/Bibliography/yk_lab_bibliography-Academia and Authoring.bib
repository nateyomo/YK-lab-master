It provides an opportunity for physicians to develop numerous skills including communication, collaboration, time management, and teamwork. Case report, as a research design, describes important scientific observations that are encountered in a clinical setting to expand our knowledge base. Preparing a case report is far easier than conducting any other elaborative research design. Case report, with its main components, should be focused and delivers a clear message. In this article, the key components of a case report were described with the aim of providing guidance to novice authors to improve the quality of their reporting.},

  abstract = {PROBLEM: Successful residency placement requires medical students to pursue activities beyond formal education, including showing their commitment to the specialty. Case reports are a common publication pursued by medical students, which provide trainees with opportunities to show commitment to the specialty, broaden their clinical and scholarly knowledge, improve their ability to find and interpret literature, and gain faculty mentorship. However, case reports can be intimidating to trainees with limited exposure to medical writing and publishing. The authors describe a case report elective designed specifically for medical students. APPROACH: Since 2018, Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine has offered a week-long medical student elective designed to teach the process of writing and publishing a case report. Students wrote a first draft of a case report during the elective. Students could pursue publication, including revisions and journal submission, after the elective. An optional, anonymous survey was sent to students who participated in the elective to evaluate their experience with the elective, motivations for taking the elective, and perceived outcomes. OUTCOMES: Between 2018 and 2021, the elective was taken by 41 second-year medical students. Five scholarship outcomes of the elective were measured, including conference presentations (35, 85\% of students) and publications (20, 49\% of students). Students who completed the survey (n = 26) indicated the elective was very valuable with an average score of 85\,{\textpm}\,15.6 (range: minimally valuable [0] to extremely valuable [100]). NEXT STEPS: Next steps for this elective will be to allocate more faculty time to this curriculum promoting both education and scholarship at the institution, and to curate a list of journals to ease the publication process. Overall, student experiences with this case report elective were positive. This report aims to provide a framework for other schools to implement similar courses for their preclinical students.},

Yet, few resources exist to assist physical therapists with the basic mechanics and quality standards of producing a clinical case report. This situation is further complicated by the absence of uniform standards for quality in case reporting. The importance of including a concise yet comprehensive description of patient functioning in all physical therapy case reports suggest the potential appropriateness of basing quality guidelines on the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF) model. The purpose of this paper is to assist physical therapists in creating high-quality clinical case reports for the peer-reviewed literature using the ICF model as a guiding framework. Along these lines, current recommendations related to the basic mechanics of writing a successful clinical case report are reviewed, as well and a proposal for uniform clinical case reporting requirements is introduced with the aim to improve the quality and feasibility of clinical case reporting in physical therapy that are informed by the ICF model.},

Relevant manuscripts were retrieved and the results were used to update a previous narrative overview of the literature. DISCUSSION: Commensurate with the increased use of evidence-based health care and recent changes in publication requirements, new standards are expected of case reports. Case reports should present new information to the literature and be written succinctly. The types of case reports available are discussed. Steps for preparing a case report are described based upon the current available literature. CONCLUSION: Case reports are important contributions to the health sciences literature. Proper preparation of this study design is necessary in order for it to be published. A self-evaluation check sheet for authors is included to assist in the writing process.},

Publication of narrative overviews of the literature should be standardized to increase their objectivity. BACKGROUND: In the past decade numerous changes in research methodology pertaining to reviews of the literature have occurred. These changes necessitate authors of review articles to be familiar with current standards in the publication process. METHODS: Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. DISCUSSION: An overview of the use of three types of reviews of the literature is presented. Step by step instructions for how to conduct and write a narrative overview utilizing a 'best-evidence synthesis' approach are discussed, starting with appropriate preparatory work and ending with how to create proper illustrations. Several resources for creating reviews of the literature are presented and a narrative overview critical appraisal worksheet is included. A bibliography of other useful reading is presented in an appendix. CONCLUSION: Narrative overviews can be a valuable contribution to the literature if prepared properly. New and experienced authors wishing to write a narrative overview should find this article useful in constructing such a paper and carrying out the research process. It is hoped that this article will stimulate scholarly dialog amongst colleagues about this research design and other complex literature review methods.},

The aim of this article was to describe and present the rules of a new game-based and structured didactic tool that can be used by teachers for 'players' (students and licensed clinicians) to learn systematic CR in musculoskeletal physiotherapy.Our tool is based on the 'Happy Families' card game, and we propose to use it as part of a classic musculoskeletal subjective examination-based hypothesis category framework and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model. It allows players to dynamically formulate hypotheses from clinical case studies. Each 'Family' of cards represents a hypothesis category. The game highlights the missing information and trains players to consider it in their CR.This game should efficiently structure all components of CR and is an interesting resource for all teachers. Its greatest strength is that it can be used with other category frameworks. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy and efficiency of such a tool and to measure students' actual progress in learning the CR.},
