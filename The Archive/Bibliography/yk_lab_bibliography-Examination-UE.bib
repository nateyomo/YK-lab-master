  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper extremity Physical Performance Tests (PPTs) have been used in sports contexts to provide functional status of the athletes. However, whether these tests present appropriate measurement properties to be considered a valuable measurement is not clear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the measurement properties of upper extremity PPTs in athletes. METHODS: Databases (e.g., Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, CENTRAL) were searched in March 2021. Two reviewers independently rated the methodological quality using the 4-point Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Quality of evidence was graded by measurement property for each test, considering the adequacy, the sample size, and the methodological quality of the studies. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included with a pooled sample of 684 athletes. The PPTs analyzed were Arm-Jump Board Test, Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test (CKCUEST), Finger Hang Test, Medicine Ball Explosive Power Test, One-Arm Hop Test, Posterior Shoulder Endurance Test, Pull-Up Shoulder Endurance Test, Repetition to Failure Assessment, Seated Medicine Ball Throw Test (SMBT), Seated Single-Arm Shot-Put Test (SSPT), Shoulder Endurance Test, Two-Arm Bent Hang Test, Unilateral Seated Shot-Put Test, and Upper Limb Rotation Test. Evidence synthesis provided moderate and high-quality evidence for sufficient inter-session and intra-session reliability of the CKCUEST, respectively. There was moderate evidence for sufficient inter-session reliability of the SSPT and for insufficient validity of the SMBT. CONCLUSION: The CKCUEST and the SSPT are sufficiently reliable in athletes. More studies are needed to investigate other psychometric properties for these tests and other upper extremity PPTs.},
