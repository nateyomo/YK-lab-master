RECENT FINDINGS               Functional neuroimaging studies have elucidated the areas involved in central control of autonomic function in humans. Optogenetic and other novel approaches in animal experiments have provided new insights into the role of these areas in autonomic control across behavioral states, including stress and the sleep-wake cycle.                                         SUMMARY               Control of the function of the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous system functions depends on complex interactions at all levels of the neuraxis. Peripheral sympathetic outputs are critical for maintenance of blood pressure, thermoregulation, and response to stress. Parasympathetic reflexes control lacrimation, salivation, pupil response to light, beat-to-beat control of the heart rate, gastrointestinal motility, micturition, and erectile function. The insular cortex, anterior and midcingulate cortex, and amygdala generate autonomic responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli. Several nuclei of the hypothalamus generate coordinated patterns of autonomic responses to internal or social stressors. Several brainstem nuclei participate in integrated control of autonomic function in relationship to respiration and the sleep-wake cycle. Disorders affecting the central or peripheral autonomic pathways, or both, manifest with autonomic failure (including orthostatic hypotension, anhidrosis, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and neurogenic bladder or erectile dysfunction) or autonomic hyperactivity, primary hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperhidrosis.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Autonomic disorders offer a fascinating view of the complexity of the nervous system. Their impact on human health ranges from benign to severe. Deciphering autonomic symptoms and signs draws on the cognitive skills and personal interest in the plight of patients that first attracted many physicians to the field of neurology. This article provides tools to sharpen those skills.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Autonomic neuroscience and accumulated clinical knowledge have led to the categorization of autonomic disorders into specific syndromes that can be identified on the basis of clinical phenotypes and physiologic responses to standardized stimuli in the autonomic laboratory. A key development has been the ability to distinguish neurogenic orthostatic hypotension from other causes of hypotension. Quantification of sudomotor responses has proven valuable in the diagnosis of thermoregulatory disorders and small fiber neuropathies such as those related to diabetes mellitus. Increasing attention has focused on autonomic failure as a defining feature of neurodegenerative {$\alpha$}-synucleinopathies, especially multiple system atrophy. As awareness of autonomic disorders has increased, the once obscure term                 dysautonomia                 has entered into common parlance.                                                        SUMMARY               With appropriate knowledge and experience, neurologists can diagnose autonomic dysfunction accurately and with confidence. The opportunity to play an important role in caring for patients with autonomic disorders is worth the effort.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Disorders of thermoregulation and sweating may manifest with hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis/anhidrosis. Primary disorders of hyperhidrosis may significantly impact quality of life yet tend to be benign. Many sweating disorders present with compensatory hyperhidrosis due to areas of anhidrosis. Anhidrosis may occur due to either central or peripheral damage to the autonomic nervous system. The thermoregulatory control of sweating involves central pathways from the hypothalamus to the brainstem and then spinal cord as well as projections to peripheral structures, including the sympathetic chain ganglia, peripheral nerves, and eccrine sweat glands. Disruption at any point of this pathway may lead to impaired sweating. Characterization of sweating dysfunction helps localize different autonomic disorders to guide diagnosis and may allow for evaluation of treatment effect.                                         SUMMARY               Sweating dysfunction manifests in myriad ways, including essential hyperhidrosis, complete anhidrosis with heat intolerance, and compensatory hyperhidrosis due to anhidrosis, and often indicates involvement of underlying central or peripheral autonomic dysfunction.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The pattern and severity of autonomic involvement in the synucleinopathies is related to differences in cellular deposition and neuronal populations affected by {$\alpha$}-synuclein aggregation, which influences the degree and manifestation of autonomic failure. Clinical and laboratory autonomic features distinguish the different synucleinopathies based on pattern and severity. These features also determine which patients are at risk for evolution from pure autonomic failure to the synucleinopathies with prominent motor involvement, such as multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, or Parkinson disease.

RECENT FINDINGS               POTS is a heterogeneous syndrome caused by several pathophysiologic mechanisms that may coexist (limited autonomic neuropathy, hyperadrenergic state, hypovolemia, venous pooling, joint hypermobility, deconditioning). Neurally mediated syncope occurs despite intact autonomic reflexes. Management of orthostatic intolerance aims to increase functional capacity, including standing time, performance of daily activities, and exercise tolerance. Nonpharmacologic strategies (fluid and salt loading, physical countermaneuvers, compression garments, exercise training) are fundamental for patients with POTS, occasionally complemented by medications to raise blood pressure or slow heart rate. Neurally mediated syncope is best managed by recognition and avoidance of triggers.                                         SUMMARY               Significant negative effects on quality of life occur in patients with POTS and in patients with recurrent neurally mediated syncope, which can be mitigated through targeted evaluation and thoughtful management.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Several recent advances in the studies of hereditary amyloidosis and the various degenerative synucleinopathies have demonstrated that simple skin biopsies can provide valuable pathologic evidence of neurologic disease. In addition to diagnosis of the underlying disorder, skin biopsies provide a quantitative structural measurement of the associated autonomic damage.                                         SUMMARY               Skin biopsies are making great inroads into the study of autonomic and peripheral nerve disorders. Complex immunohistochemical staining protocols are challenging to complete, but the rich data derived from these studies in the diagnosis and monitoring of different disease states suggest that the role of skin biopsies in the study of the autonomic nervous system will continue to expand in the years to come.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Establishing whether the cause of orthostatic hypotension is a pathologic lesion in sympathetic neurons (ie, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension) or secondary to other medical causes (ie, non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension) can be achieved by measuring blood pressure and heart rate at the bedside. Whereas fludrocortisone has been extensively used as first-line treatment in the past, it is associated with adverse events including renal and cardiac failure and increased risk of all-cause hospitalization. Distinguishing whether neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is caused by central or peripheral dysfunction has therapeutic implications. Patients with peripheral sympathetic denervation respond better to norepinephrine agonists/precursors such as droxidopa, whereas patients with central autonomic dysfunction respond better to norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.                                         SUMMARY               Management of orthostatic hypotension is aimed at improving quality of life and reducing symptoms rather than at normalizing blood pressure. Nonpharmacologic measures are the key to success. Pharmacologic options include volume expansion with fludrocortisone and sympathetic enhancement with midodrine, droxidopa, and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Neurogenic supine hypertension complicates management of orthostatic hypotension and is primarily ameliorated by avoiding the supine position and sleeping with the head of the bed elevated.},

Botulinum toxin injections into the detrusor have revolutionized the management of neurogenic detrusor overactivity.                              Bowel dysfunction commonly presents as constipation and fecal incontinence. Gastrointestinal emergencies may arise, including intestinal pseudoobstruction, intussusception, volvulus, and stercoral ulcer (ulcer of the colon due to pressure and irritation resulting from severe, prolonged constipation). Bowel function tests in neurologic patients often show a combination of slow transit and anorectal dysfunction. Management for slow transit constipation includes bulking agents, softening agents, yogurt/probiotics, and prokinetic agents. Suppositories, botulinum toxin injections, and transanal irrigation are options for managing anorectal constipation.

This article reviews basic pathophysiologic concepts regarding autonomic hyperactivity, its various forms of clinical presentation, and practical management considerations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is most common after traumatic brain injury but can also occur after other forms of severe acute diffuse or multifocal brain injury. Formal criteria for the diagnosis and severity grading of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity have now been proposed. A growing body of literature is beginning to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this disorder, but treatment remains based on observational data. Our mechanistic understanding of other distinct forms of autonomic hyperactivity, such as autonomic dysreflexia after traumatic spinal cord injury and dysautonomia after Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, remains rudimentary, yet clinical experience shows that their appropriate management can minimize the risk of serious complications.
