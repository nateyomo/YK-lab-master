  abstract = {"We are in the midst of a global mental health crisis: -More than one in six American adults now take psychiatric medication. -The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is expected to triple by 2050. -Depression is now the number one cause of disability in the world. -The COVID-19 pandemic has quadrupled reports of anxiety and depression. Although medications may ease suffering for some, in Change Your Diet, Change Your Mind, Dr. Georgia Ede argues that the most powerful way to change brain chemistry is with food, because what we eat is where our brain's chemicals come from. For years, we've been told the way to protect our brains is through superfoods and supplements--we top our oatmeal with blueberries, choose plant-based patties over hamburgers, and wash down handfuls of supplements with green smoothies. But the science says: not only do these strategies fail people, but they can also work against them. The truth about brain food is that meat is not dangerous, vegan diets are not healthier, and antioxidants will not help you. In this provocative, illuminating book, Dr. Ede explains why everything we think we know about eating for neurological psychological well-being is wrong. Most of what we accept as true is based on studies that take an "outside-in" approach, making associations between healthy people and what they eat. In her book, Dr. Ede takes an inside-out stance, drawing on a range of disciplines like biochemistry, neuroscience, and botany to explain why a ketogenic diet combined with "kinder, gentler plant foods" is the best way to nourish, protect, and energize the brain"--},

  abstract = {"Now in a fully rewritten fourth edition, this is the authoritative presentation of motivational interviewing (MI), the powerful approach to facilitating change. It has been updated and streamlined to be even more user-friendly as a practitioner guide and course text. MI originators William R. Miller and Stephen Rollnick elucidate the four tasks of MI--engaging, focusing, evoking, and planning--and vividly demonstrate what they look like in action. A wealth of vignettes and interview examples illustrate the dos and don'ts of successful implementation in diverse contexts. The book reviews the evidence base for the approach and covers ways to assess the quality of MI. The companion website provides reflection questions, annotated case material, and additional helpful resources.
