  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inspiratory muscle training (IMT)~aims to improve respiratory muscle strength and endurance.~Clinical trials used various training protocols,~devices and respiratory measurements to check the effectiveness of this intervention. The current guidelines reported a possible advantage of IMT, particularly in people with respiratory muscle weakness. However, it remains unclear to what extent IMT~is clinically beneficial, especially when associated with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). ~ OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as a stand-alone intervention and when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) EBSCO, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 20 October 2021.~We also checked reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IMT in combination with PR versus PR alone and IMT versus control/sham.~We included different types of IMT irrespective of the mode of delivery.~We~excluded~trials that used~resistive devices without controlling the breathing pattern or a training load of less than 30\% of maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), or both. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods recommended by Cochrane including assessment of risk of bias with RoB 2. Our primary outcomes were dyspnea, functional exercise capacity and health-related quality of life.~ MAIN RESULTS: We included 55 RCTs in this review. Both IMT and PR protocols varied significantly across the trials, especially in training duration, loads, devices, number/ frequency of sessions and the PR programs. Only eight trials were at low risk of bias. PR+IMT versus PR We included 22 trials (1446 participants) in this comparison. Based on a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of -1 unit, we did not find an improvement in dyspnea assessed with the~Borg scale~at submaximal exercise capacity (mean difference (MD) 0.19, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.42 to 0.79; 2 RCTs, 202 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). ~ We also found no improvement in dyspnea assessed with themodified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRC) according to an MCID between -0.5 and -1 unit (MD -0.12, 95\% CI -0.39 to 0.14; 2 RCTs, 204 participants; very low-certainty evidence).~ Pooling evidence for the~6-minute walk distance (6MWD)~showed~an increase of 5.95 meters~(95\% CI -5.73~to 17.63; 12 RCTs, 1199 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and failed to reach the~MCID of 26 meters. In subgroup analysis, we divided the RCTs according to the training duration and mean baseline PImax. The test for subgroup differences was not significant. Trials at low risk of bias (n = 3) demonstrated a larger effect estimate than the overall. The summary effect of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) revealed an overall~total score below the MCID of 4 units (MD 0.13, 95\% CI -0.93 to 1.20; 7 RCTs, 908 participants; low-certainty evidence).~ The summary effect of COPD Assessment Test (CAT) did not show an improvement in the HRQoL (MD 0.13, 95\% CI -0.80 to 1.06; 2 RCTs, 657 participants; very low-certainty evidence), according to an MCID of -1.6 units.~ Pooling the RCTs that reported PImax showed an increase of 11.46 cmH2O (95\% CI 7.42 to 15.50; 17 RCTs, 1329 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) but failed to reach the MCID of 17.2 cmH2O. ~In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness.~ One abstract reported some adverse effects that were considered "minor and self-limited". IMT versus control/sham Thirty-seven~RCTs with 1021 participants contributed to our second comparison. There was a trend towards an improvement when Borg was calculated~at submaximal exercise capacity~(MD -0.94, 95\% CI -1.36 to -0.51; 6 RCTs, 144 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Only one trial was at a low risk of bias. Eight studies (nine arms) used the Baseline Dyspnea Index - Transition Dyspnea Index (BDI-TDI).~Based on an MCID of +1 unit, they~showed an improvement only with the 'total score' of the TDI (MD 2.98, 95\% CI 2.07 to 3.89; 8 RCTs, 238 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We~did not find a difference between studies classified as with and without respiratory muscle weakness. Only one trial was at low risk of bias. Four studies reported the mMRC, revealing a possible~improvement in dyspnea~in the IMT group~(MD -0.59, 95\% CI -0.76 to -0.43; 4 RCTs, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two trials were at low risk of bias. Compared to control/sham, the MD in the 6MWD following IMT was 35.71 (95\% CI 25.68~to 45.74; 16 RCTs, 501 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Two studies were at low risk of bias. In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness.~ Six studies reported theSGRQ total score, showing a larger effect in the IMT~group~(MD -3.85, 95\% CI -8.18 to 0.48; 6 RCTs, 182 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The lower limit of the 95\% CI exceeded the MCID of -4 units. Only one study was at low risk of bias. There was an improvement in life quality with CAT (MD -2.97, 95\% CI -3.85 to -2.10; 2 RCTs, 86 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial was at low risk of bias. Thirty-two RCTs reported PImax, showing an improvement without reaching the MCID (MD 14.57 cmH2O, 95\% CI 9.85 to 19.29; 32 RCTs, 916 participants; low-certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness. ~ None of the included RCTs reported adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: IMT may not~improve dyspnea, functional exercise capacity and life quality when associated with PR. However, IMT is likely to improve these outcomes when provided alone. For both interventions, a larger effect in participants with respiratory muscle weakness and with longer training durations is still to be confirmed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by an incompletely reversible limitation in airflow. A physiological variable--the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)--is often used to grade the severity of COPD. However, patients with COPD have systemic manifestations that are not reflected by the FEV1. We hypothesized that a multidimensional grading system that assessed the respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD would better categorize and predict outcome in these patients. METHODS: We first evaluated 207 patients and found that four factors predicted the risk of death in this cohort: the body-mass index (B), the degree of airflow obstruction (O) and dyspnea (D), and exercise capacity (E), measured by the six-minute-walk test. We used these variables to construct the BODE index, a multidimensional 10-point scale in which higher scores indicate a higher risk of death. We then prospectively validated the index in a cohort of 625 patients, with death from any cause and from respiratory causes as the outcome variables. RESULTS: There were 25 deaths among the first 207 patients and 162 deaths (26 percent) in the validation cohort. Sixty-one percent of the deaths in the validation cohort were due to respiratory insufficiency, 14 percent to myocardial infarction, 12 percent to lung cancer, and 13 percent to other causes. Patients with higher BODE scores were at higher risk for death; the hazard ratio for death from any cause per one-point increase in the BODE score was 1.34 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.26 to 1.42; P{$<$}0.001), and the hazard ratio for death from respiratory causes was 1.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.48 to 1.77; P{$<$}0.001). The C statistic for the ability of the BODE index to predict the risk of death was larger than that for the FEV1 (0.74 vs. 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: The BODE index, a simple multidimensional grading system, is better than the FEV1 at predicting the risk of death from any cause and from respiratory causes among patients with COPD.},
