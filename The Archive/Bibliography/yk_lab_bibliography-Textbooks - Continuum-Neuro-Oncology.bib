  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Management of metastasis to the central nervous system (CNS) has evolved, and molecular characterization of metastatic disease is now routinely done. Targeted therapies, once few in number with limited penetration into the CNS, have multiplied in number and increased in CNS coverage. This article addresses recent advances in the evaluation and clinical management of patients with CNS metastasis.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Metastasis of cancer to the CNS can be diagnosed and characterized with novel techniques, including molecular analyses of the spinal fluid, so-called                 liquid biopsies                 . Resected parenchymal CNS metastases are now routinely subjected to genomic sequencing. For patients with CNS metastases displaying targetable mutations, a wide variety of treatment options are available, including deferral of radiation therapy in favor of a trial of an orally bioavailable targeted therapy or immunotherapy. For patients without a molecularly targetable lesion, local treatment in the form of radiation therapy, now most often stereotactic radiosurgery, is supplanting untargeted whole-brain radiation therapy.                                                        SUMMARY               Technologic advances in diagnosis and management have resulted in new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to patients with metastasis to the CNS, with resulting improvements in progression-free and overall survival.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The appropriate initial evaluation and accurate diagnosis of gliomas require an understanding of the spectrum of clinical and radiographic presentations. Recent advances in the understanding of distinct molecular prognostic subtypes have led to major revisions in the diagnostic classification of gliomas. Integration of these new diagnostic and molecular classifications is an important part of the modern management of gliomas and facilitates better understanding and interpretation of the efficacy of different therapies in specific glioma subtypes.                                         SUMMARY               The management of adult gliomas is a multidisciplinary endeavor. However, despite recent molecular and treatment advances, the majority of diffuse gliomas remain incurable, and efforts aimed at the development and testing of new therapies in clinical trials are ongoing.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cancer therapies can cause a wide range of neurologic adverse effects and may result in significant patient morbidity and mortality. Although some treatment-associated neurologic complications manifest acutely and are often reversible and transient, others occur with delayed onset, can be progressive, and are uniquely challenging to patient management. With an increase in multimodality and combination therapies, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies, and prolonged patient survival, novel and unique patterns of neurologic complications have emerged.                                         SUMMARY               Both conventional and novel cancer therapies can adversely affect the nervous system, thereby producing a wide range of neurologic complications. Increased awareness among neurologists and early recognition of cancer therapy--induced neurotoxic syndromes is critically important to minimize patient morbidity, prevent permanent injury, and improve patient outcomes.},

This article also provides an overview of the emerging clinical scenarios in which paraneoplastic and autoimmune neurologic disorders may occur.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The number of autoantibodies associated with paraneoplastic neurologic disorders has rapidly expanded over the past 2 decades. These discoveries have improved our ability to diagnose patients with these disorders and have provided insight into their pathogenesis. It is now recognized that these antibodies can be broadly divided into two major categories based on the location of the target antigen: intracellular and cell surface/synaptic. Antibodies to intracellular antigens are almost always accompanied by cancer, respond less well to immunotherapy, and have an unfavorable outcome. In contrast, antibodies to cell surface or synaptic targets are less often accompanied by cancer, generally respond well to immunotherapy, and have a good prognosis. Paraneoplastic and autoimmune neurologic disorders are now being recognized in novel settings, including their occurrence as an immune-related adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for cancer.                                         SUMMARY               This article discusses when to suspect a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome, the diagnostic utility and pitfalls of neural autoantibody testing, how to best detect the underlying tumor, and the treatment approach that involves combinations of antineoplastic treatments, immunosuppressants, and supportive/symptomatic treatments.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Patients with primary malignant brain tumors generally have a poor prognosis and experience progressive neurologic decline and significant physical and psychological symptoms. Management of these symptoms, including fatigue, mood disorders, and the manifestations of cerebral edema, can be challenging. Caregivers for these patients have high rates of psychological distress and report significant caregiving burden. Although the benefit of early palliative care for patients with other advanced solid tumors is well established, our understanding of the role of palliative care in neuro-oncology is incomplete, and thus palliative care and hospice services remain underutilized.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with brain tumors and their caregivers have significant supportive care needs, which often differ from the needs of patients with cancers outside of the nervous system. Clinicians face challenges associated with managing patients' symptoms and adequately facilitating prognostic understanding and decision making. Palliative care and hospice services may offer important benefits for this population.},

This article reviews the clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, diagnostic workup, novel pathophysiologic insights, and treatment of immunocompetent patients with primary CNS lymphoma.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The prognosis of primary CNS lymphoma has significantly improved over the past few decades because of the introduction of and widespread use of high-dose methotrexate, which is now the backbone of all first-line combination chemotherapy treatments. Despite this progress, durable remission is still observed in only approximately 50\% of patients. Novel insights into the pathophysiology of primary CNS lymphoma have identified the B-cell receptor pathway as well as the suppressed tumor immune microenvironment and immune evasion as key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of primary CNS lymphoma. Novel, small molecules and agents targeting these aberrant pathways have been introduced into clinical trials of recurrent/refractory primary CNS lymphomas. Agents such as the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib or immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide have shown promising response rates in the relapsed setting.                                         SUMMARY               Diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma requires a high level of suspicion because clinical signs and deficits can vary and depend on the involved CNS compartments. Rapid initiation of therapy is essential for recovery and prognosis. The optimal treatment regimen has not been defined, but methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimens are considered the standard treatment approach for induction treatment. Novel, targeted agents have recently been introduced into the therapeutic arsenal.},

Although these complications can be seen in patients without cancer as well, the purpose of this review is to highlight how the presentation, etiology, and management of delirium, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, and central nervous system infections may be different in patients with cancer.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Some of the newer anticancer therapies are associated with neurologic complications. Delirium and seizures have been described in patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and other immune effector cell therapies. Angiogenesis inhibitors can increase the risk of bleeding and clotting, including intracranial hemorrhage and stroke. The risk of opportunistic fungal infections, including aspergillosis, is elevated with the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib.                                         SUMMARY               Providers should familiarize themselves with neurologic complications in patients with cancer because early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes.

RECENT FINDINGS               Both meningiomas and pituitary adenomas are common brain tumors. In many cases, these lesions are found incidentally on imaging when patients are being evaluated for a variety of symptoms and signs. While nonmalignant, these tumors are occasionally associated with significant morbidity due to location and resulting secondary symptoms. Rarely, these tumors can also transform into malignant variants. Surgical techniques allow for more complete resections with minimal complications. Significant progress is being made in understanding the molecular biology of meningioma, which may result in wider availability of targeted therapies, especially for patients who are not candidates for other therapeutic modalities. Medical therapies for secretory pituitary adenomas continue to evolve. Craniopharyngiomas are nonmalignant tumors associated with significant morbidity due to their location. Molecular subtypes exist and may respond to targeted agents. Glioneuronal tumors are low-grade neoplasms potentially cured by gross total resection; however, residual and recurrent disease may require additional therapy. Recent studies have identified potentially targetable molecular alterations in more than half of cases.                                         SUMMARY               Meningiomas and pituitary adenomas are frequently encountered in neurologic practice, and familiarity with their presentation and management is essential for a practicing neurologist. Craniopharyngiomas, meningiomas, and glioneuronal tumors are characterized by a high frequency of potentially actionable genetic alterations, and targeted therapies may eventually supplement surgical therapy of these nonmalignant tumors.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Pediatric brain tumors are a heterogeneous group of tumors that differ from adult brain cancers despite similar nomenclature. With the added complexity of the developing brain, treatment regimens are tailored to protect neurocognitive outcomes without sacrificing long-term survival. The 2016 World Health Organization's classification incorporated molecular characteristics to aid in defining the diagnosis and prognosis of these tumors. These changes have enabled providers to stratify patients, thus intensifying therapies in those with high-risk diseases and modifying treatments to reduce morbidity for children and to provide better outcomes. Recent published findings from clinical trials have been especially helpful for gliomas, embryonal tumors, and ependymomas. By using this new information, molecular factors that correlate with survival have been identified in patients. In addition, genetic findings in tumor tissue have also led to revelations in predisposing germline mutations.                                         SUMMARY               New findings from clinical trials and molecular stratification will shape the next generation of therapies in hopes of improving overall outcome, identifying pathways in tumorigenesis, and aiding in genetic counseling for children and their families.},

This article reviews common inherited nervous system tumor syndromes including neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex, and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. The epidemiology, genetics, approach to diagnosis, neurologic and nonneurologic manifestations, and management options are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Awareness of the more common and clinically relevant familial nervous system tumor syndromes is important. These conditions teach us about the underlying biology that drives tumor development in the central and peripheral nervous systems including peripheral nerve sheath tumors (eg, neurofibroma, schwannoma), meningioma, vestibular schwannoma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, and hemangioblastoma. Knowledge of the clinical manifestations ensures that the neurologist will be able to diagnose these conditions, recommend appropriate surveillance, refer to specialists, and support optimal management. Important discoveries in the role of the underlying genetics have contributed to the launch of several novel drug trials for these tumors, which are changing therapeutic options for patients.
