  abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most debilitating problems for humans. About 6 months after the initial injury, a cascade of secondary cellular and molecular events occurs and the primary damage enters the chronic phase. Current treatments are not curative. One of the new treatment methods is the use of cell therapy, which is gradually being tested in clinical trials to improve the symptoms of SCI patients. In this review article, we investigated the effect of different cell therapy trials in improving patients' symptoms and their paraclinical indicators. In the 72 final reviewed studies with 1144 cases and 186 controls, 20 scores were recorded as outcomes. We categorized the scores into seven groups. In upper extremity motor score, daily living function, trunk stability, postural hypotension, somatosensory evoked potential, and motor evoked potential scores, the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell therapy had a more healing effect. In the International Association of Neurorestoratology SCI Functional Rating Scale, light touch score, bowel function, decreased spasticity, Visual Analog Scale, and electromyography scores, the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell had more impact. The olfactory ensheathing cell had a greater effect on lower extremity motor score and pinprick scores than other cells. The embryonic stem cell had the greatest effect in improving the important score of the American Spinal Injury Association scale. Based on the obtained results, it seems that a special cell should be used to improve each symptom of patients with chronic SCI, and if the improvement of several harms is involved, the combination of cells may be effective.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis and systematic review were conducted to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHOD: We conducted a manual search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, with a search deadline set for February 1, 2023. Data analysis was performed using Stata version 15.0. RESULT: A total of 9 randomized controlled studies were included, involving a total of 316 people, including 159 mesenchymal stem cells and 147 control groups. Results of meta-analysis: Compared to a placebo group, the administration of mesenchymal stem cells resulted in a significant reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores among patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke [SMD=-0.99,95\% CI (-1.93, -0.05)]. Compared to placebo, barthel index [SMD\,=\,0.48,95\% CI (-0.55,1.51)], modified rankin score [SMD\,=\,0.45, 95\% CI (1.11, 0.21)], adverse events (RR\,=\,0.68, 95\% CI (0.40, 1.17)] the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Based on current studies, mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can ameliorate neurological deficits in patients with ischemic stroke to a certain extent without increasing adverse reactions. However, there was no significant effect on Barthel index and Modified Rankin score.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) present a valuable treatment option for knee osteoarthritis with promising results. The purpose of the present study was to systematically review the clinical and functional outcomes following mesenchymal stem cell application focusing on early to moderate knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: A systematic search was done using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. All Studies published between 2017 and March 2023 on patients treated with single mesenchymal stem cell injection for Kellgren-Lawrence grade I-III knee osteoarthritis reported on clinical and functional outcomes were included. RESULTS: Twelve articles comprising 539 patients and 576 knees treated with a single intraarticular injection of MSCs for knee osteoarthritis were included in the current systematic review. In eligible studies, the reported outcomes were improved concerning patient-reported outcomes measures, knee function, pain relief, and quality of patient's life. CONCLUSION: Based on high-level evidence studies, single intraarticular injection of MSCs is a safe, reliable, and effective treatment option for Kellgren-Lawrence grade I-III knee osteoarthritis. However, the lack of homogeneity in the included studies and the variance in MSCs sources and preparations should be noted. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and although restoring striatal dopamine levels may improve symptoms, no treatment can cure or reverse the disease itself. Stem cell therapy has a regenerative effect and is being actively studied as a candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Mesenchymal stem cells are considered a promising option due to fewer ethical concerns, a lower risk of immune rejection, and a lower risk of teratogenicity. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells and their derivatives on motor function, memory, and preservation of dopaminergic neurons in a Parkinson's disease animal model. We searched bibliographic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science) to identify articles and included only peer-reviewed               in vivo               interventional animal studies published in any language through June 28, 2023. The study utilized the random-effect model to estimate the 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of the standard mean differences (SMD) between the treatment and control groups. We use the systematic review center for laboratory animal experimentation's risk of bias tool and the collaborative approach to meta-analysis and review of animal studies checklist for study quality assessment. A total of 33 studies with data from 840 Parkinson's disease model animals were included in the meta-analysis. Treatment with mesenchymal stem cells significantly improved motor function as assessed by the amphetamine-induced rotational test. Among the stem cell types, the bone marrow MSCs with neurotrophic factor group showed largest effect size (SMD [95\% CI] = --6.21 [--9.50 to --2.93],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 0.0 \%). The stem cell treatment group had significantly more tyrosine hydroxylase positive dopaminergic neurons in the striatum ([95\% CI] = 1.04 [0.59 to 1.49],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 65.1 \%) and substantia nigra (SMD [95\% CI] = 1.38 [0.89 to 1.87],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 75.3 \%), indicating a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons. Subgroup analysis of the amphetamine-induced rotation test showed a significant reduction only in the intracranial-striatum route (SMD [95\% CI] = --2.59 [--3.25 to --1.94],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 74.4 \%). The memory test showed significant improvement only in the intravenous route (SMD [95\% CI] = 4.80 [1.84 to 7.76],               P               = 0.027,               I               2               = 79.6 \%). Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to positively impact motor function and memory function and protect dopaminergic neurons in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease. Further research is required to determine the optimal stem cell types, modifications, transplanted cell numbers, and delivery methods for these protocols.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The onset of OA is affected by a variety of factors, which eventually lead to the loss of cartilage in the joints, the formation of osteophytes, the loss of normal knee mobility, and pain and discomfort, which seriously affects the quality of life. HUC-MSCs can promote cartilage production and have been widely used in research in the past decade. This article systematically summarizes that it is well used in basic research and clinical studies to promote inflammatory chondrogenesis in the treatment of OA. Provide a theoretical basis for clinical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study collected CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed, and articles related to the treatment of OA with HUC-MSCs since their publication, excluding non-basic and clinical studies such as reviews and meta-analysis. A total of 31 basic experimental studies and 12 clinical studies were included. Systematically analyze the effects of HUC-MSCs on inhibiting inflammatory factors, promoting chondrocyte production, and current clinical treatment. RESULTS: HUC-MSCs can reduce inflammatory factors such as MMP-13, ADAMTS-5, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-{$\alpha$}, induced conversion from M1 to M2 in OA to protect cartilage damage and reduce OA inflammation. Synthesize ColII, SOX9, and aggrecan at the same time to promote cartilage synthesis. CONCLUSION: HUC-MSCs not only have typical stem cell biological characteristics, but also have rich sources and convenient material extraction. Compared with stem cells from other sources, HUC-MSCs have stronger proliferation, differentiation, and immune regulation abilities. Furthermore, there are no ethical issues associated with their use. SAFETY: Primarily attributed to pain, the majority of individuals experience recovery within 24~h following injection. HUC-MSCs possess the ability to alleviate pain, enhance knee joint function, and potentially postpone the need for surgical intervention in both non-surgical and other cases, making them highly deserving of clinical promotion and application.},
