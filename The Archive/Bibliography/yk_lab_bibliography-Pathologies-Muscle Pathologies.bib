  abstract = {Delayed-onset muscular soreness (DOMS), the sensation of pain and stiffness in the muscles that occurs from 1 to 5 d following unaccustomed exercise, can adversely affect muscular performance, both from voluntary reduction of effort and from inherent loss of capacity of the muscles to produce force. This reduction in performance is temporary; permanent impairment does not occur. A number of clinical correlates are associated with DOMS, including elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure; exertional rhabdomyolysis appears to be the extreme form of DOMS. Presently, the best treatment for DOMS appears to be muscular activity, although the sensation again returns following the exercise. Training for the specific contractile activity that causes DOMS reduces the soreness response. The etiology and cellular mechanisms of DOMS are not known, but a number of hypotheses exist to explain the phenomenon. The following model may be proposed: 1) high tensions (particularly those associated with eccentric exercise) in the contractile/elastic system of the muscle result in structural damage; 2) cell membrane damage leads to disruption of Ca++ homeostasis in the injured fibers, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 2 d post-exercise; and 3) products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents accumulate in the interstitium, which in turn stimulate free nerve endings of group-IV sensory neurons in the muscles leading to the sensation of DOMS.},

  abstract = {Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder involving~a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Progressive muscle weakness, most notably of the proximal lower limbs, is the primary manifestation of this condition.~The onset of BMD symptoms varies widely between 5 and 60 years. In a study involving 67 individuals with BMD, most were found ambulant until their 40s or older, while a small group experienced earlier loss of ambulation.~BMD symptoms usually~appear at a later age~than~a similar X-linked disorder, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD and BMD may be easier to distinguish based on~the age at which patients become wheelchair-dependent. Patients with DMD are wheelchair-dependent before age 13, while individuals with BMD may remain ambulatory even after age 16.~Patients presenting with proximal muscle weakness before turning 12 may be hard to diagnose without genetic analysis. BMD is currently considered a mild form of DMD rather than a distinct clinical entity. Consequently, interventional trials are more rarely conducted for BMD than DMD. Skeletal muscle fibers (myocytes) arise from the fusion of contiguous embryonic muscle cells and are thus multinucleated. Multiple nuclei may be found close to the intracytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane (sarcolemma). Myocytes have abundant microfilaments, which give rise to the contractile apparatus of the myofibrils. The repeating units of myofibrils are the sarcomeres, composed of interlaced actin and myosin filaments and perpendicularly oriented Z-bands.~The T-tubule system is a sarcolemmal invagination into the~myocyte involved in calcium storage and release during contraction. The sarcoplasm (myocyte cytoplasm) contains myoglobin, glycogen, creatine, creatine kinase (CK), lysosomes,~mitochondria, and lipid vacuoles.~ Actin binds to the subsarcolemmal cytoskeletal protein dystrophin,~which interfaces with~the extracellular matrix through transmembrane dystrophin-associated proteins. Dystrophin normally provides mechanical reinforcement, stabilizing the cell membrane.~Dystrophin abnormality is the leading cause of BMD.},
