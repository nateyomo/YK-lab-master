  abstract = {Circulating blood CD34(+) cells consist of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, angiogenic cells, and endothelial cells. In addition to their clinical use in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, CD34(+) cells may also promote therapeutic neovascularization. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence circulating CD34(+) cell frequency has wide implications for vascular biology in addition to stem cell transplantation. In the present study, we examined the clinical and genetic characteristics associated with circulating CD34(+) cell frequency in a large, community-based sample of 1786 Framingham Heart Study participants.Among subjects without cardiovascular disease (n = 1595), CD34(+) frequency was inversely related to older age, female sex, and smoking. CD34(+) frequency was positively related to weight, serum total cholesterol, and statin therapy. Clinical covariates accounted for 6.3\% of CD34(+) variability. CD34(+) frequency was highly heritable (h(2) = 54\%; P {$<$} .0001). Genome-wide association analysis of CD34(+) frequency identified suggestive associations at several loci, including OR4C12 (chromosome 11; P = 6.7 {\texttimes} 10(-7)) and ENO1 and RERE (chromosome 1; P = 8.8 {\texttimes} 10(-7)). CD34(+) cell frequency is reduced in older subjects and is influenced by environmental factors including smoking and statin use. CD34(+) frequency is highly heritable. The results of the present study have implications for therapies that use CD34(+) cell populations and support efforts to better understand the genetic mechanisms that underlie CD34(+) frequency.},

  abstract = {Neutrophils and neutrophil-like cells are the major pathogen-fighting immune cells in organisms ranging from slime molds to mammals. Central to their function is their ability to be recruited to sites of infection, to recognize and phagocytose microbes, and then to kill pathogens through a combination of cytotoxic mechanisms. These include the production of reactive oxygen species, the release of antimicrobial peptides, and the recently discovered expulsion of their nuclear contents to form neutrophil extracellular traps. Here we discuss these primordial neutrophil functions, which also play key roles in tissue injury, by providing details of neutrophil cytotoxic functions and congenital disorders of neutrophils. In addition, we present more recent evidence that interactions between neutrophils and adaptive immune cells establish a feed-forward mechanism that amplifies pathologic inflammation. These newly appreciated contributions of neutrophils are described in the setting of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a member of the pro-inflammatory cytokine family, induces the expression of a variety of proteins responsible for acute inflammation, and plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of cells in humans. IL-6 signaling is mediated by building a complex of IL-6, the transmembrane IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R) or with soluble forms of IL-6R (sIL-6R), and the signal-transducing subunit molecule gp130. Therefore, three modes for IL-6 signaling may occur in which IL-6 is binding to mIL-6R (classic), to sIL-6R (trans-signaling), or is joined through IL-6R to gp130 on nearby located cells (trans-presentation). These pathways, and the fact that gp130 is ubiquitously expressed, lead to the pleiotropic functions of IL-6. The control of IL-6 signaling is regulated through the induction of suppressor molecules after activation of the IL-6 pathways as well as through the presence of sIL-6R and gp130 forms in the blood. Vice versa, an overproduction of IL-6 and dysregulation of the IL-6 signaling pathways can result in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders as well as cancer development suggesting that IL-6 plays a significant role in the human cytokine network. Several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for inhibiting the cytokine itself, the signaling via the IL-6 receptor, or target kinases (e.g., JAK/STAT) associated with the signaling pathways. Amongst others, tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R humanized antibody) has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cytokine release syndrome, and idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease (iMCD), whereas siltuximab (an IL-6 antagonist) received approval for iMCD only. Although not all IL-6-associated diseases respond to IL-6 blockade, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the IL-6 pathways may, therefore, help to find the best treatment for IL-6-associated diseases in the near future.},
