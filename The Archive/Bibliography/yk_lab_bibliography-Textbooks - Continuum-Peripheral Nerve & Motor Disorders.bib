Recent Findings:               Advances in clinical phenotyping and outcomes assessment have enabled neurologists to improve disease recognition, treatment, and disease monitoring. Our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of demyelinating neuropathies is evolving. Identification of new antibodies and recognition that node of Ranvier dysfunction may be an early pathogenic feature may herald further diagnostic and treatment advancements.                                         Summary:               The chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies are heterogeneous. The clinical and diagnostic features are sometimes overlapping, and the specific disorders are variable in pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis. This heterogeneity underscores the importance of achieving diagnostic accuracy and implementing disease-specific treatment approaches.},

Recent Findings:               GBS is an acute/subacute-onset polyradiculoneuropathy typically presenting with sensory symptoms and weakness over several days, often leading to quadriparesis. Approximately 70\% of patients report a recent preceding upper or lower respiratory tract infection or gastrointestinal illness. Approximately 30\% of patients require intubation and ventilation because of respiratory failure. Nerve conduction studies in the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) form of GBS typically show evidence for a multifocal demyelinating process, including conduction block or temporal dispersion in motor nerves. Sural sparing is a common phenomenon when testing sensory nerves. CSF analysis commonly shows an elevated protein, but this elevation may not be present until the third week of the illness. Patients with AIDP are treated with best medical management and either IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange.                                         Summary:               GBS is a common form of acute quadriparesis; a high level of suspicion is needed for early diagnosis. With appropriate therapy, most patients make a very good to complete recovery.},

The spectrum of motor neuron diseases is reviewed, and the clinical heterogeneity of ALS is described.                                         Recent Findings:               ALS is increasingly recognized as a clinical spectrum disorder with pure upper and pure lower motor neuron presentations, supported by genetic links. The phenotypic variability is broad. Identification of ALS-related genes provides insights into disease mechanisms.                                         Summary:               ALS is a progressive fatal multisystem neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Clinical recognition of suspicious symptoms and the appropriate laboratory evaluation are essential to limit diagnostic delay and avoid unnecessary testing and procedures. ALS has broad genetic and hypothesized environmental causes and phenotypic variability. Recognizing related motor neuron diseases will prevent misdiagnosis while allowing proper disease counseling. Although ALS cannot be cured, implementation of appropriate symptomatic treatment is valuable.},

To simplify the approach to this category of patients, sensory-predominant polyneuropathies are divided broadly into either small fiber (or pain-predominant) neuropathies and large fiber (or ataxia-predominant) neuropathies, of which the sensory neuronopathies (dorsal root ganglionopathies) are highlighted.                                         Recent Findings:               Physicians can now easily perform skin biopsies in their offices, allowing access to the gold standard pathologic diagnostic tool for small fiber neuropathies. Additional diagnostic techniques, such as corneal confocal microscopy, are emerging. Recently, small fiber neuropathies have been associated with a broader spectrum of diseases, including fibromyalgia, sodium channel mutations, and voltage-gated potassium channel antibody autoimmune disease.                                         Summary:               Despite advances in diagnosing small fiber neuropathies and sensory neuronopathies, many of these neuropathies remain refractory to treatment. In select cases, early identification and treatment may result in better outcomes. ``Idiopathic'' should be a diagnosis of exclusion and a thorough investigation for treatable causes pursued.},

Recent Findings:               Axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathies have been well described for some time. Recent advances include the assessment of the incidence of peripheral neuropathy in the elderly, the recognition of the limited influence of electrodiagnostic testing on the clinical management of uncomplicated axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, the development of guidelines for treatment of painful neuropathy, the identification of risk factors predisposing patients for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, a report on the association of metabolic syndrome and idiopathic axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, and the availability of more cost-effective genetic testing for identifying inherited polyneuropathies.

These rare diagnoses include cramp-fasciculation syndrome, Isaacs syndrome, and Morvan syndrome. Recent investigations have led to an understanding of the autoimmune underpinnings of these conditions and their specific associated antibodies. As the presentation of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes includes muscle stiffness, twitches, and spasms, which are also shared with certain central nervous system and myopathic conditions, the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes is reviewed.                                         Recent Findings:               Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes share clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of motor nerve instability; however, their clinical presentations are varied. Case reviews have helped us understand the spectrum of symptoms associated with the three peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes reviewed here: cramp-fasciculation syndrome, Isaacs syndrome, and Morvan syndrome. More recently, research has focused on understanding the voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies as well as neoplasms associated with these conditions.                                         Summary:               The diagnosis of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes requires a high index of suspicion, support from the physical examination, familiarity with the spectrum of symptoms associated with peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes, and recognition of diagnostic EMG features. Voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies are associated with these conditions. Optimum treatment and autoimmune pathogenesis remain areas of active research.},
