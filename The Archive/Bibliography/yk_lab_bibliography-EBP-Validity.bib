  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychometric concepts have undergone a transformation in health fields, as articulated in a consensus report by an international panel of health measurement experts: COSMIN, the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this paper are to describe emerging ideas relating to the development and testing of new measures in health fields, to present a revised measurement taxonomy that builds upon COSMIN, and to explore the extent to which the new measurement concepts have played a role in psychometric assessments in nursing. DESIGN: A descriptive analysis of a sample of psychometric papers published in three major nursing journals was undertaken. METHODS: A new measurement taxonomy is presented and explained. A sample of 105 studies, representing a consecutive sample of psychometric studies published in the International Journal of Nursing Studies, Nursing Research, and Research in Nursing \& Health between 2010 and 2014 was reviewed to ascertain the extent to which psychometric assessments in nursing map onto the new taxonomy. RESULTS: Most nursing studies reviewed adhered to traditional concepts of psychometric assessment, which focus on reliability and validity. The studies in the sample rarely involved assessments of longitudinal measurement aspects, namely the reliability and validity of change scores (responsiveness). CONCLUSIONS: Many constructs of interest to nurse researchers are amenable to change-and these constructs are frequently the target of nursing interventions designed to foster change. Future psychometric work by nurse researchers would benefit from assessments of the psychometric adequacy of change scores.},

  abstract = {This article considers the role of measurement validity within physical therapy research. The concept of measurement validity is identified as a component of internal validity, and it is differentiated from the notion of reliability; these concepts are related to systematic and random sources of error, respectively. Using examples from physical therapy and rehabilitation, four main types of validity are reviewed: face validity, criterion-related validity, content validity, and construct validity. The differing implications of these types of validity for quantitative and qualitative research are discussed. Three principal areas of concern are then addressed, based on a critical discussion of selected examples from the literature. First, it is argued that validity is often poorly distinguished from the allied concept of reliability and that purported claims for validity often only demonstrate reliability. Second, it is claimed that validity is too often neglected in favor of reliability, and specific examples relating to gait analysis are put forward to support this argument. Third, some of the methodological difficulties that may occur when attempts are made to demonstrate validity are considered. The article concludes with a plea for a closer focus on the issue of measurement validity within physical therapy research.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the phenomenon of "regression toward the mean." The primary effect of this is to affect scores on retesting so that they are closer to the population mean. Thus, people who are selected for inclusion in a study because their scores on some measure are above (or below) some criterion have values on retesting that are less extreme. This may make it appear that the study participants have improved; this will occur even in the absence of an effective intervention. We explore the reasons for regression toward the mean and how it can be detected and discuss some methods that may minimize its effects.},
