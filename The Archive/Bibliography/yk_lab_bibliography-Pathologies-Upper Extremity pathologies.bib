  abstract = {Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a frequently overlooked peripheral nerve compression or tension event that creates difficulties for the clinician regarding diagnosis and management. Investigators have categorized this condition as vascular versus neurogenic, where vascular TOS can be subcategorized as either arterial or venous and neurogenic TOS can subcategorized as either true or disputed. The thoracic outlet anatomical container presents with several key regional components, each capable of compromising the neurovascular structures coursing within. Bony and soft tissue abnormalities, along with mechanical dysfunctions, may contribute to neurovascular compromise. Diagnosing TOS can be challenging because the symptoms vary greatly amongst patients with the disorder, thus lending to other conditions including a double crush syndrome. A careful history and thorough clinical examination are the most important components in establishing the diagnosis of TOS. Specific clinical tests, whose accuracy has been documented, can be used to support a clinical diagnosis, especially when a cluster of positive tests are witnessed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proper management of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) requires an understanding of the underlying causes of the disorder. A comprehensive examination process, as described in Part 1 of this review, can reveal the bony and soft tissue abnormalities and mechanical dysfunctions contributing to an individual's TOS symptoms. OBJECTIVE: Part 2 of this review focuses on management of TOS. CONCLUSION: The clinician uses clinical examination results to design a rehabilitation program that focuses on correcting specific problems that were previously identified. Disputed neurogenic TOS is best managed with a trial of conservative therapy before surgical treatment options are considered. Cases that are resistant to conservative treatment may require surgical intervention. True neurogenic TOS may require surgical intervention to relieve compression of the neural structures in the thoracic outlet. Surgical management is required for cases of vascular TOS because of the potentially serious complications that may arise from venous or arterial compromise. Post-operative rehabilitation is recommended after surgical decompression to address factors that could lead to a reoccurrence of the patient's symptoms.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of false-positive findings of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) shoulder maneuvers, Adson's test (AT), costoclavicular maneuver (CCM), elevated arm stress test (EAST), and supraclavicular pressure (SCP) in healthy subjects. METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study was performed in a medical school and affiliated emergency medicine residency program setting. Participants included healthy adult volunteers without symptoms of TOS. The shoulder maneuvers AT, CCM, EAST, and SCP were performed in randomized order for 30 sec, 30 sec, 3 min, and 30 sec, respectively. Pulse quality and the presence and timing of pain or paresthesias were assessed. RESULTS: 53 subjects were enrolled, including 27 women, aged 29.7 +/- 6.4 years (range 21-58 years). AT, CCM, EAST, and SCP resulted in an altered pulse in 11\%, 11\%, 62\%, and 21\%; pain in 0\%, 0\%, 21\%, and 2\%; and paresthesias in 11\%, 15\%, 36\%, and 15\% of cases, respectively. The following outcomes had reasonable false-positive rates (upper 95\% confidence limit): pain with the AT (7\%), CCM (7\%), SCP (10\%), or any 2 TOS shoulder maneuvers (10\%); discontinuing the EAST because of symptoms (16\%); or any symptom with 3 (13\%) or 4 (7\%) TOS shoulder maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS: In a study of TOS shoulder maneuvers in healthy subjects, the outcomes of pulse alteration or paresthesias were unreliable in general. However, TOS shoulder maneuvers have reasonably low false-positive rates when a positive outcome is defined as pain after AT, CCM, or SCP; discontinuation of the EAST secondary to pain; pain in the same arm with {$>$} or =2 maneuvers; or any symptom in the same arm with {$>$} or =3 maneuvers.},
