  abstract = {"In order to prepare readers to work effectively with people who have sustained spinal cord injuries, a text must encompass a basic understanding of spinal cord injuries and issues relevant to disability, knowledge of the physical skills involved in functional activities and the processes involved in acquiring these skills, and an approach to the individual that promotes self-respect and encourages autonomy. Spinal Cord Injury: Functional Rehabilitation was written to provide such a comprehensive treatment of the subject. The reader will gain a broad knowledge base relevant to spinal cord injuries and will develop an understanding of both the physical skills required for functional activities and the therapeutic strategies for achieving these skills. As importantly, the reader will gain an appreciation for the importance of psychosocial adaptation after spinal cord injury and will develop some insight into the impact that rehabilitation professionals can have in this area"--},
