  abstract = {A herniated disc in the spine is a condition during which a nucleus pulposus is displaced from intervertebral space. It is a common cause of back pain. The patients who experience pain related to a herniated disc often remember an inciting event that caused their pain. Unlike mechanical back pain, herniated disc pain is often burning or stinging, and may radiate into the lower extremity. Furthermore, in more severe cases, there can be associated with weakness or sensation changes. In the spine, a disc or a nucleus pulposus is localized between vertebral bodies.~It supports the spine by acting as a shock-absorbing cushion.~In some instances, a herniated disc injury can compress the nerve or the spinal cord that causes pain consistent with nerve compression or spinal cord dysfunction, also known as myelopathy. Herniated discs can be very painful. Unfortunately, there are limited effective conservative treatment modalities with significant effectiveness. Within a few weeks, most cases of painful disc herniation heal. In many instances, the herniation of the disc does not cause that patient any pain. Herniated discs are often seen on MRIs of asymptomatic patients. Imaging is not indicated in a patient with signs and symptoms of a stable herniated disc until six weeks of persistent symptoms. MRI is the imaging modality of choice. Most cases of herniated disc heal conservatively, but refractory cases may require interventional procedures or surgical repair. Epidural corticosteroid injections are effective pain relievers for disc herniation in the short term, while discectomy is more effective than conservative management until one year following surgery~. Providers need to remain aware of treating the patient with a herniated disc and monitor for severe or rapidly progressing neurological changes; this would be an indication for urgent neurosurgical referral.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Using MR imaging, nerve root sedimentation sign (SedSign) was demonstrated to have a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) in selected patients. This study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of SedSign in differential diagnosis of LSS and non-specific low back pain (LBP) in consecutive patients. METHODS: A series of consecutive patients with lumbar spinal MRI examination for back/leg pain in orthopeadic clinic were included. These patients were followed up and divided into two groups, symptomatic LSS and non-specific LBP, according to symptoms and radiological findings. Using MR images, SedSign was assessed by two spine surgeons and one radiologist independently. Then sensitivity and specificity of SedSign was calculated. RESULT: A total of 320 patients (105 LSS and 215 non-specific LBP) were included. The SedSign had a sensitivity of 77.1~\% and specificity of 47.0~\% in the whole cohort. When these patients were stratified by dural sac cross-sectional areas (CSA), the SedSign had a sensitivity of 95.0~\% and specificity of 4.7~\% in patients with CSA~{$\leq~$}80~mm2 (severe radiologic stenosis), sensitivity of 74.2~\% and specificity of 22.6~\% in patients with CSA 80-100~mm2 (moderate radiologic stenosis), and sensitivity of 58.8~\% and specificity of 61.0~\% in patients with CSA 100-120~mm2 (mild radiologic stenosis). In selected cases composed by LSS patients with CSA~{$\leq~$}80~mm2 and non-specific LBP patients with CSA~{$>~$}120~mm2, however, the SedSign had a sensitivity of 95.0~\% and specificity of 80.0~\%. CONCLUSION: The present data demonstrated that the SedSign was not able to discriminate symptomatic LSS from non-specific LBP after adjusting by dural sac CSA. The diagnostic value of the SedSign was still uncertain.},
