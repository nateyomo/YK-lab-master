  abstract = {Swimming has become a popular recreational activity as well as a highly competitive sport in the United States. The repetitive nature of swimming can predispose the shoulder to mechanical impingement and microtrauma, which may lead to laxity, rotator cuff fatigue, and subsequent secondary impingement. Improper stroke mechanics can place the swimmer's shoulder at further risk. The purpose of this paper is to describe the pathology of secondary impingement in freestyle swimmers and to discuss the clinical implications for rehabilitation of swimmers with the pathology. A thorough subjective and objective evaluation is necessary to design a successful rehabilitation program. The rehabilitation program for swimmers with secondary impingement includes modification of training, flexibility, range of motion, strengthening, and mobilization as indicated. Functional and proprioceptive training may also be useful techniques in the rehabilitation of swimmer's shoulder. Improper stroke mechanics can also have clinical implications on swimmer's shoulders with secondary impingement. The clinical implication of secondary impingement in freestyle swimmers suggests that the primary goal of rehabilitation is to promote equilibrium of the shoulder complex while accounting for the demands of the sport.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an exercise protocol, with and without manual therapy, on scapular kinematics, function, pain, and mechanical sensitivity in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. BACKGROUND: Stretching and strengthening exercises have been shown to effectively decrease pain and disability in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. There is still conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of adding manual therapy to an exercise therapy regimen. METHODS: Forty-six patients were assigned to 1 of 2 groups, one of which received a 4-week intervention of stretching and strengthening exercises (exercise alone) and the other the same intervention, supplemented by manual therapy targeting the shoulder and cervical spine (exercise plus manual therapy). All outcomes were measured preintervention and postintervention at 4 weeks. Outcome measures were scapular kinematics in the scapular and sagittal planes during arm elevation, function as determined through the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, pain as assessed with a visual analog scale, and mechanical sensitivity as assessed with pressure pain threshold. RESULTS: Independent of the intervention group, small, clinically irrelevant changes in scapular kinematics were observed postintervention. A significant group-by-time interaction effect (P = .001) was found for scapular anterior tilt during elevation in the sagittal plane, with a 3.0{$^\circ$} increase (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -1.5{$^\circ$}, 7.5{$^\circ$}) relative to baseline in the exercise-plus-manual therapy group compared to a decrease of 0.3{$^\circ$} (95\% CI: -4.2{$^\circ$}, 4.8{$^\circ$}) in the exercise-alone group. Pain, mechanical sensitivity, and the DASH score improved similarly for both groups by the end of the intervention period. CONCLUSION: Adding manual therapy to an exercise protocol did not enhance improvements in scapular kinematics, function, and pain in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. The noted improvements in pain and function are not likely explained by changes in scapular kinematics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Close Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test (CKCUES test) is a low cost shoulder functional test that could be considered as a complementary and objective clinical outcome for shoulder performance evaluation. However, its reliability was tested only in recreational athletes' males and there are no studies comparing scores between sedentary and active samples. The purpose was to examine inter and intrasession reliability of CKCUES Test for samples of sedentary male and female with (SIS), for samples of sedentary healthy male and female, and for male and female samples of healthy upper extremity sport specific recreational athletes. Other purpose was to compare scores within sedentary and within recreational athletes samples of same gender. METHODS: A sample of 108 subjects with and without SIS was recruited. Subjects were tested twice, seven days apart. Each subject performed four test repetitions, with 45 seconds of rest between them. The last three repetitions were averaged and used to statistical analysis. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient ICC2,1 was used to assess intrasession reliability of number of touches score and ICC2,3 was used to assess intersession reliability of number of touches, normalized score, and power score. Test scores within groups of same gender also were compared. Measurement error was determined by calculating the Standard Error of the Measurement (SEM) and Minimum detectable change (MDC) for all scores. RESULTS: The CKCUES Test showed excellent intersession reliability for scores in all samples. Results also showed excellent intrasession reliability of number of touches for all samples. Scores were greater in active compared to sedentary, with exception of power score. All scores were greater in active compared to sedentary and SIS males and females. SEM ranged from 1.45 to 2.76 touches (based on a 95\% CI) and MDC ranged from 2.05 to 3.91(based on a 95\% CI) in subjects with and without SIS. At least three touches are needed to be considered a real improvement on CKCUES Test scores. CONCLUSION: Results suggest CKCUES Test is a reliable tool to evaluate upper extremity functional performance for sedentary, for upper extremity sport specific recreational, and for sedentary males and females with SIS.},
