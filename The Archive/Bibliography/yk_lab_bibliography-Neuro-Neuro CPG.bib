  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aphasia is a common consequence of stroke, and people who live with this condition experience poor outcomes. Adherence to clinical practice guidelines can promote high-quality service delivery and optimize patient outcomes. However, there are currently no high-quality guidelines specific to post-stroke aphasia management. AIMS: To identify and evaluate recommendations from high-quality stroke guidelines that can inform aphasia management. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: We conducted an updated systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to identify high-quality clinical guidelines published between January 2015 and October 2022. Primary searches were performed using electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Gray literature searches were conducted using Google Scholar, guideline databases, and stroke websites. Clinical practice guidelines were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines and Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool. Recommendations were extracted from high-quality guidelines (scored\,{$>$}\,66.7\% on Domain 3: "Rigor of Development"), classified as aphasia-specific or aphasia-related, and categorized into clinical practice areas. Evidence ratings and source citations were assessed, and similar recommendations were grouped. Twenty-three stroke clinical practice guidelines were identified and 9 (39\%) met our criteria for rigor of development. From these guidelines, 82 recommendations for aphasia management were extracted: 31 were aphasia-specific, 51 aphasia-related, 67 evidence-based, and 15 consensus-based. CONCLUSION: More than half of stroke clinical practice guidelines identified did not meet our criteria for rigorous development. We identified 9 high-quality guidelines and 82 recommendations to inform aphasia management. Most recommendations were aphasia-related; aphasia-specific recommendation gaps were identified in three clinical practice areas: "accessing community supports," "return to work, leisure, driving," and "interprofessional practice."},

  abstract = {Background               : The World Health Organization has released the first global public health guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behavior for people living with disability. This paper presents the guidelines, related processes, and evidence, and elaborates upon how the guidelines can support inclusive policy, practice, and research.               Methods               : Methods were consistent with the World Health Organization protocols for developing guidelines. Systematic reviews of the evidence on physical activity for health for people living with disability were appraised, along with a consideration of the evidence used to inform the general 2020 World Health Organization guidelines.               Results               : Evidence supported the development of recommendations for people living with disability, stressing that there are no major risks to engaging in physical activity appropriate to an individual's current activity level, health status, and physical function, and that the health benefits accrued generally outweigh the risks. They also emphasize the benefits of limiting sedentary behavior.               Conclusions               : The guidelines mark a positive step forward for disability inclusion, but considerable effort is needed to advance the agenda. This paper highlights key considerations for the implementation of the new recommendations for people living with disability, in line with the human rights agenda underpinning the Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018--2030 and allied policies.},

  abstract = {Background:               Uncompensated vestibular hypofunction can result in symptoms of dizziness, imbalance, and/or oscillopsia, gaze and gait instability, and impaired navigation and spatial orientation; thus, may negatively impact an individual's quality of life, ability to perform activities of daily living, drive, and work. It is estimated that one-third of adults in the United States have vestibular dysfunction and the incidence increases with age. There is strong evidence supporting vestibular physical therapy for reducing symptoms, improving gaze and postural stability, and improving function in individuals with vestibular hypofunction. The purpose of this revised clinical practice guideline is to improve quality of care and outcomes for individuals with acute, subacute, and chronic unilateral and bilateral vestibular hypofunction by providing evidence-based recommendations regarding appropriate exercises.                                         Methods:               These guidelines are a revision of the 2016 guidelines and involved a systematic review of the literature published since 2015 through June 2020 across 6 databases. Article types included meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control series, and case series for human subjects, published in English. Sixty-seven articles were identified as relevant to this clinical practice guideline and critically appraised for level of evidence.                                         Results:               Based on strong evidence, clinicians should offer vestibular rehabilitation to adults with unilateral and bilateral vestibular hypofunction who present with impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions related to the vestibular deficit. Based on strong evidence and a preponderance of harm over benefit, clinicians should not include voluntary saccadic or smooth-pursuit eye movements in isolation (ie, without head movement) to promote gaze stability. Based on moderate to strong evidence, clinicians may offer specific exercise techniques to target identified activity limitations and participation restrictions, including virtual reality or augmented sensory feedback. Based on strong evidence and in consideration of patient preference, clinicians should offer supervised vestibular rehabilitation. Based on moderate to weak evidence, clinicians may prescribe weekly clinic visits plus a home exercise program of gaze stabilization exercises consisting of a minimum of: (1) 3 times per day for a total of at least 12 minutes daily for individuals with acute/subacute unilateral vestibular hypofunction; (2) 3 to 5 times per day for a total of at least 20 minutes daily for 4 to 6 weeks for individuals with chronic unilateral vestibular hypofunction; (3) 3 to 5 times per day for a total of 20 to 40 minutes daily for approximately 5 to 7 weeks for individuals with bilateral vestibular hypofunction. Based on moderate evidence, clinicians may prescribe static and dynamic balance exercises for a minimum of 20 minutes daily for at least 4 to 6 weeks for individuals with chronic unilateral vestibular hypofunction and, based on expert opinion, for a minimum of 6 to 9 weeks for individuals with bilateral vestibular hypofunction. Based on moderate evidence, clinicians may use achievement of primary goals, resolution of symptoms, normalized balance and vestibular function, or plateau in progress as reasons for stopping therapy. Based on moderate to strong evidence, clinicians may evaluate factors, including time from onset of symptoms, comorbidities, cognitive function, and use of medication that could modify rehabilitation outcomes.                                         Discussion:               Recent evidence supports the original recommendations from the 2016 guidelines. There is strong evidence that vestibular physical therapy provides a clear and substantial benefit to individuals with unilateral and bilateral vestibular hypofunction.                                         Limitations:               The focus of the guideline was on peripheral vestibular hypofunction; thus, the recommendations of the guideline may not apply to individuals with central vestibular disorders. One criterion for study inclusion was that vestibular hypofunction was determined based on objective vestibular function tests. This guideline may not apply to individuals who report symptoms of dizziness, imbalance, and/or oscillopsia without a diagnosis of vestibular hypofunction.                                         Disclaimer:               These recommendations are intended as a guide to optimize rehabilitation outcomes for individuals undergoing vestibular physical therapy. The contents of this guideline were developed with support from the American Physical Therapy Association and the Academy of Neurologic Physical Therapy using a rigorous review process.

  abstract = {Background:               Individuals with acute-onset central nervous system (CNS) injury, including stroke, motor incomplete spinal cord injury, or traumatic brain injury, often experience lasting locomotor deficits, as quantified by decreases in gait speed and distance walked over a specific duration (timed distance). The goal of the present clinical practice guideline was to delineate the relative efficacy of various interventions to improve walking speed and timed distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following these specific diagnoses.                                         Methods:               A systematic review of the literature published between 1995 and 2016 was performed in 4 databases for randomized controlled clinical trials focused on these specific patient populations, at least 6 months postinjury and with specific outcomes of walking speed and timed distance. For all studies, specific parameters of training interventions including frequency, intensity, time, and type were detailed as possible. Recommendations were determined on the basis of the strength of the evidence and the potential harm, risks, or costs of providing a specific training paradigm, particularly when another intervention may be available and can provide greater benefit.                                         Results:               Strong evidence indicates that clinicians should offer walking training at moderate to high intensities or virtual reality--based training to ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance. In contrast, weak evidence suggests that strength training, circuit (ie, combined) training or cycling training at moderate to high intensities, and virtual reality--based balance training may improve walking speed and distance in these patient groups. Finally, strong evidence suggests that body weight--supported treadmill training, robotic-assisted training, or sitting/standing balance training without virtual reality should not be performed to improve walking speed or distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance.                                         Discussion:               The collective findings suggest that large amounts of task-specific (ie, locomotor) practice may be critical for improvements in walking function, although only at higher cardiovascular intensities or with augmented feedback to increase patient's engagement. Lower-intensity walking interventions or impairment-based training strategies demonstrated equivocal or limited efficacy.                                         Limitations:               As walking speed and distance were primary outcomes, the research participants included in the studies walked without substantial physical assistance. This guideline may not apply to patients with limited ambulatory function, where provision of walking training may require substantial physical assistance.                                         Summary:               The guideline suggests that task-specific walking training should be performed to improve walking speed and distance in those with acute-onset CNS injury although only at higher intensities or with augmented feedback. Future studies should clarify the potential utility of specific training parameters that lead to improved walking speed and distance in these populations in both chronic and subacute stages following injury.                                         Disclaimer:               These recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians to optimize rehabilitation outcomes for persons with chronic stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury to improve walking speed and distance.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the process and outcomes of using a new evidence base to develop scientific guidelines that specify the type and minimum dose of exercise necessary to improve fitness and cardiometabolic health in adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: International. METHODS: Using Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II reporting criteria, steps included (a) determining the guidelines' scope; (b) conducting a systematic review of relevant literature; (c) holding three consensus panel meetings (European, Canadian and International) to formulate the guidelines; (d) obtaining stakeholder feedback; and (e) process evaluation by an AGREE II consultant. Stakeholders were actively involved in steps (c) and (d). RESULTS: For cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength benefits, adults with a SCI should engage in at least 20\,min of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise 2 times per week AND 3 sets of strength exercises for each major functioning muscle group, at a moderate to vigorous intensity, 2 times per week (strong recommendation). For cardiometabolic health benefits, adults with a SCI are suggested to engage in at least 30\,min of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise 3 times per week (conditional recommendation). CONCLUSIONS: Through a systematic, rigorous, and participatory process involving international scientists and stakeholders, a new exercise guideline was formulated for cardiometabolic health benefits. A previously published SCI guideline was endorsed for achieving fitness benefits. These guidelines represent an important step toward international harmonization of exercise guidelines for adults with SCI, and a foundation for developing exercise policies and programs for people with SCI around the world.},

  abstract = {Background:               Use of outcome measures (OMs) in adult neurologic physical therapy is essential for monitoring changes in a patient's status over time, quantifying observations and patient-reported function, enhancing communication, and increasing the efficiency of patient care. OMs also provide a mechanism to compare patient and organizational outcomes, examine intervention effectiveness, and generate new knowledge. This clinical practice guideline (CPG) examined the literature related to OMs of balance, gait, transfers, and patient-stated goals to identify a core set of OMs for use across adults with neurologic conditions and practice settings.                                         Methods:               To determine the scope of this CPG, surveys were conducted to assess the needs and priorities of consumers and physical therapists. OMs were identified through recommendations of the Academy of Neurologic Physical Therapy's Evidence Database to Guide Effectiveness task forces. A systematic review of the literature on the OMs was conducted and additional OMs were identified; the literature search was repeated on these measures. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were critically appraised by 2 reviewers using a modified version of the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments. (COSMIN) checklist. Methodological quality and the strength of statistical results were determined. To be recommended for the core set, the OMs needed to demonstrate excellent psychometric properties in high-quality studies across neurologic conditions.                                         Results/Discussion:               Based on survey results, the CPG focuses on OMs that have acceptable clinical utility and can be used to assess change over time in a patient's balance, gait, transfers, and patient-stated goals. Strong, level I evidence supports the use of the Berg Balance Scale to assess changes in static and dynamic sitting and standing balance and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale to assess changes in balance confidence. Strong to moderate evidence supports the use of the Functional Gait Assessment to assess changes in dynamic balance while walking, the 10 meter Walk Test to assess changes in gait speed, and the 6-Minute Walk Test to assess changes in walking distance. Best practice evidence supports the use of the 5 Times Sit-to-Stand to assess sit to standing transfers. Evidence was insufficient to support use of a specific OM to assess patient-stated goals across adult neurologic conditions. Physical therapists should discuss the OM results with patients and collaboratively decide how the results should inform the plan of care.
