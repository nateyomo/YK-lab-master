  abstract = {This systematic review aims to reveal the effectiveness of proprioceptive exercise combined with dual-task training in stroke patients. The research was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to evaluate studies of rehabilitation interventions with proprioceptive and dual-task exercises in patients with stroke. The keywords for the search were: "stroke" AND "proprioception" OR "proprioceptive" AND "rehabilitation" OR "training" OR "exercises" AND "dual-task" OR "task-performance" with the following inclusion criteria: comparative studies of rehabilitation interventions with proprioceptive and dual-task exercises in stroke patients. Of the 104,014 studies identified, 23 were included according to the inclusion criteria. Proprioceptive and dual-task exercises stimulate and promote postural balance, gait, and quality of life and reduce the risk of falls in stroke patients compared with traditional rehabilitation programs. In conclusion, this systematic review suggests that proprioceptive exercise combined with dual-task training is needed to improve balance and recover gait. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on the various proprioceptive treatments with contextual dual-task exercises for imbalance after stroke, providing a guide for choosing a complete rehabilitation protocol that combines these two techniques.},

  abstract = {The modified Brostr{\"o}m procedure (MBP) is an initial treatment for symptomatic chronic ankle instability (CAI) patients. This study aimed to compare the proprioception and neuromuscular control ability of both affected and unaffected ankles at the time of return to sports after MBP for patients with scores of normal controls. 75 individuals (40 who underwent MBP, 35 normal controls) participated. The dynamic balance test scores were significantly higher in the affected ankle of the patients than in the controls (1.5\,{\textpm}\,0.6{$^\circ$} vs. 1.1\,{\textpm}\,0.4{$^\circ$}, p\,{$<$}\,0.003). The time to peak torque for dorsiflexion (60.8\,{\textpm}\,13.9~ms vs. 52.2\,{\textpm}\,17.5~ms, p\,{$<$}\,0.022) and eversion (68.9\,{\textpm}\,19.1~ms vs. 59.3\,{\textpm}\,21.1~ms, p\,{$<$}\,0.043) was significantly delayed in the affected ankle of the patients than in the controls. The dynamic balance test and time to peak torque in CAI patients remained significantly reduced at the time of return-to-sport after MBP. Clinicians and therapists should be aware of potential deficits in proprioception and neuromuscular control when determining the timing of return to sports after MBP.},
