  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dry sauna treatments improve the quality of life for chronic pain, congestive heart failure, and type 2 diabetes patients. This study aimed to determine whether dry sauna therapy improved the quality of life of obese people. METHODS: A total of 38 consecutive participants aged over 20 years with a body mass index of {$\geq$}25 kg/m2 were recruited for the study. The participants were treated with a 90{$^\circ$}C dry sauna for 15 minutes, twice daily for 4 consecutive days. To assess the quality of life, all participants completed the 5 level EQ-5D questionnaires and the EQ-Visual Analog Scale. Study parameters were measured on the same day prior to commencing the sauna sessions in a fasted state and 2 days after the last sauna session. RESULTS: The average age was 62.3{\textpm}9.5 years; 84.2\% of the participants were female. The mean body mass index was 28.5{\textpm}2.4 kg/m2. Dry sauna significantly improved the mean 5 level EQ-5D index scores from 0.83{\textpm}0.12 to 0.89{\textpm}0.11 and increased the mean EQ-Visual Analog Scale from 79.0{\textpm}15.2 to 91.1{\textpm}9.7. However, there were no significant changes in body mass index, blood pressure, heart rate, or body composition before and after the 8-session sauna therapy. CONCLUSION: Dry sauna improved the health-related quality of life of obese patients without adverse events. Further clinical studies in larger study populations are needed to verify these findings and provide concrete evidence for obesity treatment.},

  abstract = {Background               . The effect of thermal stress on the physiological parameters of young overweight and sedentary men who sporadically use the sauna remains insufficiently investigated.               Aim               . The aim of the study was to determine the effect of sauna bathing on the physiological parameters of young overweight, physically inactive men and to test the correlations between physiological parameters versus anthropometric features and body composition parameters.               Materials and Methods               . Forty-five overweight and sedentary men aged 20.76{\textpm}2.4 y were exposed to four sauna sessions of 10 minutes each (temperature: 90-91{$^\circ$}C; relative humidity: 14-16 \%) with four 5-minute cool-down breaks. Body composition was determined before sauna, and body mass and blood pressure were measured before and after sauna. Physiological parameters were monitored during four 10-minute sauna sessions.               Results               . A significant (p{$<$}0.0001) increase in all analyzed physiological parameters was observed during four successive 10-minute sauna sessions. Heart rate, energy expenditure, blood pressure, and body mass loss were most strongly correlated with anthropometric parameters (body mass, body mass index, and body surface area) and body composition parameters (percent body fat, body fat mass, and visceral fat level). The 60-minute treatment resulted in a significant reduction in body mass (0.65 kg).               Conclusions               . Repeated use of Finnish sauna induces significant changes in the physiological parameters of young sedentary overweight men, and these changes are intensified during successive treatments. Deleterious cardiovascular adaptations were most prevalent in men characterized by the highest degree of obesity and the largest body size.},

  abstract = {We investigated functional, morphological and molecular adaptations to strength training exercise and cold water immersion (CWI) through two separate studies. In one study, 21 physically active men strength trained for 12 weeks (2 days per week), with either 10 min of CWI or active recovery (ACT) after each training session. Strength and muscle mass increased more in the ACT group than in the CWI group (P {$<$} 0.05). Isokinetic work (19\%), type II muscle fibre cross-sectional area (17\%) and the number of myonuclei per fibre (26\%) increased in the ACT group (all P {$<$} 0.05), but not the CWI group. In another study, nine active men performed a bout of single-leg strength exercises on separate days, followed by CWI or ACT. Muscle biopsies were collected before and 2, 24 and 48 h after exercise. The number of satellite cells expressing neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (10-30\%) and paired box protein (Pax7) (20-50\%) increased 24-48 h after exercise with ACT. The number of NCAM(+) satellite cells increased 48 h after exercise with CWI. NCAM(+) - and Pax7(+) -positive satellite cell numbers were greater after ACT than after CWI (P {$<$} 0.05). Phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase(Thr421/Ser424) increased after exercise in both conditions but was greater after ACT (P {$<$} 0.05). These data suggest that CWI attenuates the acute changes in satellite cell numbers and activity of kinases that regulate muscle hypertrophy, which may translate to smaller long-term training gains in muscle strength and hypertrophy. The use of CWI as a regular post-exercise recovery strategy should be reconsidered.},

  abstract = {Cold water immersion (CWI) is very popular as a method reducing post-exercise muscle stiffness, eliminating fatigue, decreasing exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD), and recovering sports performance. However, there are conflicting opinions as to whether CWI functions positively or negatively. The mechanisms of CWI are still not clear. In this systematic review, we used meta-analysis aims to examine the effect of CWI on fatigue recovery after high-intensity exercise and exercise performance. A total of 20 studies were retrieved and included from PubMed, PEDro and Elsevier databases in this review. Publication years of articles ranged from 2002 to 2022. In selected studies including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Crossover design (COD). Analyses of subjective indicators such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and objective indicators such as countermovement jump (CMJ) and blood plasma markers including creatine kinase(CK), lactate/lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), C-reactive protein(CRP), and IL-6 were performed. Pooled data showed as follows: CWI resulted in a significant decline in subjective characteristics (delayed-onset muscle soreness and perceived exertion at 0~h); CWI reduced countermovement jump(CMJ) significantly at 0 h, creatine kinase(CK) was lowered at 24 h, and lactate at 24 and 48~h. There was no evidence that CWI affects C-reactive protein(CRP) and IL-6 during a 48-h recovery period. Subgroup analysis revealed that different CWI sites and water temperatures have no effect on post-exercise fatigue recovery. Recommended athletes immersed in cold water immediately after exercise, which can effectively reduce muscle soreness and accelerate fatigue recovery.},
