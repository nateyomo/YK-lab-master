  abstract = {Brown-S{\'e}quard syndrome is defined as an incomplete pattern of injury following a hemisection of the spinal cord resulting~in weakness~or paralysis, loss of proprioception and vibration sense on the same side of the damage, and loss of pain and temperature sensations on the opposite side (see Image:~Brown-S{\'e}quard Syndrome). Specific deficits depend~on the site and mechanism of injury.~As an incomplete spinal cord~syndrome, the clinical presentation of Brown-S{\'e}quard syndrome may vary, with neurological deficits ranging from mild to severe.},
