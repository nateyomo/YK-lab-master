  abstract = {The dorsal spinocerebellar tract (DSCT), also known as the posterior spinocerebellar tract or Flechsig tract, is a somatosensory part of the sensory nervous system that relays unconscious proprioceptive information from the lower limbs and trunk of the body to the cerebellum. Sensory information is recognized as an electrical signal and is transmitted via various tracts throughout the nervous system. Proprioception is the ability to sense position and perform movements of different parts of the body. Proprioceptors, a type of mechanoreceptor, are responsible for recognizing proprioceptive signals. Golgi muscle tendons and muscle spindles are two main types of proprioceptors that detect muscle strain and muscle contraction, respectively.},
