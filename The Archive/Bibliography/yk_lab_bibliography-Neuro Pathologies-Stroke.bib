  abstract = {Unilateral stroke can lead to a disorder of postural balance that manifests as a pushing away toward the contralesional side. It is called "pusher syndrome" (PS). The aims of this study were first to assess the anatomical cortical regions that induce PS and second to clarify whether tilt of the subjective visual vertical (SVV)--a sign of vestibular otolith dysfunction--is associated with PS. Sixty-six patients with acute unilateral strokes (28 left-sided lesions, 38 right-sided lesions) were tested for PS, for tilts of the SVV, for hemineglect and for the anatomical lesion site by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based voxelwise lesion-behavior mapping analysis. Our data indicated no significant voxels; however, there was a trend towards an association between lesions of the posterior part of the insula, the operculum and the superior temporal gyrus--key areas of the multisensory vestibular cortical network--and the extent of pushing in patients with right-sided lesions, whereas the rather anterior part of the insula, the operculum as well as the internal capsule reaching to the lateral thalamus seemed to be involved in PS in left-sided lesion patients. These data might point toward a link between the systems responsible for postural control and for processing vestibular otolith information. These findings indicate that vestibular information might be fundamental in right-sided lesion patients for maintaining body posture in space.},

  abstract = {This systematic review aims to reveal the effectiveness of proprioceptive exercise combined with dual-task training in stroke patients. The research was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to evaluate studies of rehabilitation interventions with proprioceptive and dual-task exercises in patients with stroke. The keywords for the search were: "stroke" AND "proprioception" OR "proprioceptive" AND "rehabilitation" OR "training" OR "exercises" AND "dual-task" OR "task-performance" with the following inclusion criteria: comparative studies of rehabilitation interventions with proprioceptive and dual-task exercises in stroke patients. Of the 104,014 studies identified, 23 were included according to the inclusion criteria. Proprioceptive and dual-task exercises stimulate and promote postural balance, gait, and quality of life and reduce the risk of falls in stroke patients compared with traditional rehabilitation programs. In conclusion, this systematic review suggests that proprioceptive exercise combined with dual-task training is needed to improve balance and recover gait. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on the various proprioceptive treatments with contextual dual-task exercises for imbalance after stroke, providing a guide for choosing a complete rehabilitation protocol that combines these two techniques.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: People exhibiting post-stroke lateropulsion actively push their body across the midline to the more affected side and/or resist weight shift toward the less affected side. Despite its prevalence and associated negative rehabilitation outcomes, no clinical practice guidelines exist for the rehabilitation of post-stroke lateropulsion. We aimed to develop consensus-based clinical practice recommendations for managing post-stroke lateropulsion using an international expert panel. DESIGN: This Delphi panel process conformed with Guidance on Conducting and Reporting Delphi Studies recommendations. PARTICIPANTS: Panel members had demonstrated clinical and/or scientific background in the rehabilitation of people with post-stroke lateropulsion. MAIN MEASURES: The process consisted of four electronic survey rounds. Round One consisted of 13 open questions. Subsequent rounds ascertained levels of agreement with statements derived from Round One. Consensus was defined a priori as {$\geq$}75\% agreement (agree or strongly agree), or {$\geq$}70\% agreement after excluding 'unsure' responses. RESULTS: Twenty participants completed all four rounds. Consensus was achieved regarding a total of 119 recommendations for rehabilitation approaches and considerations for rehabilitation delivery, positioning, managing fear of falling and fatigue, optimal therapy dose, and discharge planning. Statements for which 'some agreement' (50\%-74\% agreement) was achieved and those for which recommendations remain to be clarified were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations build on existing evidence to guide the selection of interventions for post-stroke lateropulsion. Future research is required to elaborate specific rehabilitation strategies, consider the impact of additional cognitive and perceptual impairments, describe positioning options, and detail optimal therapy dose for people with lateropulsion.},
