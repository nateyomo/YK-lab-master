  abstract = {The manner of innervation of the obturator internus, superior and inferior gemelli, and the quadratus femoris in humans (101 pelvic halves) and in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta: 8 pelvic halves) were investigated. In most specimens, the inferior gemellus originated from the lateral surface of the ischial tuberosity and also from the medial surface (intrapelvic origin) just beneath the obturator internus and was covered by the falciform process of the sacrotuberous ligament. The superior gemellus was frequently innervated by the nerve to the obturator internus and the nerve to the quadratus femoris (60.4\%), and the inferior gemellus was innervated by the obturator internus nerve in two specimens. The quadratus femoris nerve originated from more cranial segments than the obturator internus nerve, however these nerves had various communication patterns inside and outside the muscles. According to the intramuscular nerve distribution, in some specimens the branches to the superior gemellus from the quadratus femoris nerve extended to the inferior gemellus, and the branches to the inferior gemellus were distributed to the obturator internus. The present findings revealed that the positional relationships among the branches to the obturator internus and gemelli muscles are relatively constant, although the branching patterns and innervation patterns were varied. The various patterns and routes are considered to reflect the variability of the differentiation patterns of the anlage of the muscles. A possible schematic model of the positional relationships between the muscles and the nerves is proposed.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The insertional anatomy of the FHB tendon was measured in 30 fresh frozen cadaver specimens. The FHB was then cyclically loaded and bone sequentially removed from the proximal phalangeal base until specimen failure occurred. RESULTS: The mean length of the lateral and medial FHB insertions measured 9.0 +/- 0.6 mm and 8.0 +/- 0.5 mm, respectively (p {$<$} 0.0001). The mean width of the lateral and medial FHB insertions measured 7.1 +/- 1.0 mm and 8.8 +/- 1.4 mm, respectively (p {$<$} 0.0001). FHB insertion length as a percentage of total proximal phalangeal length was 26\% +/- 3\% medially and 30\% +/- 3\% laterally. Twenty-two specimens failed at the FHB insertion site after an average of 7.8 +/- 1.0 mm or 24\% +/- 3\% of the total length of the proximal phalanx had been resected from the base. CONCLUSION: Six millimeters of bone or 20\% of the proximal phalangeal length could be safely removed from the hallux proximal phalangeal base without compromising the integrity of the FHB insertion to a physiologic load. Retaining 10 mm of the hallux proximal phalangeal base during amputation would preserve the medial FHB insertion and sacrifice none to less than 0.4 mm of the lateral insertion in our specimens. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates how much hallux proximal phalangeal base can be resected during first MTP arthroplasty or needs to be retained during amputation to preserve FHB function.},

  abstract = {We studied the contributions of the long and short heads of the biceps (LHB, SHB) to anterior stability in 13 cadaver shoulders. The LHB and SHB were replaced by spring devices and translation tests at 90 degrees abduction of the arm were performed by applying a 1.5 kg anterior force. The position of the humeral head was monitored by an electromagnetic tracking device with or without an anterior translational force; with 0 kg, 1.5 kg or 3 kg loads applied on either LHB or SHB tendons in 60 degrees, 90 degrees or 120 degrees of external rotation; and with the capsule intact, vented, or damaged by a Bankart lesion. The anterior displacement of the humeral head under 1.5 kg force was significantly decreased by both the LHB and SHB loading in all capsular conditions when the arm was in 60 degrees or 90 degrees of external rotation. At 120 degrees of external rotation, anterior displacement was significantly decreased by LHB and SHB loading only when there was a Bankart lesion. We conclude that LHB and SHB have similar functions as anterior stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint with the arm in abduction and external rotation, and that their role increases as shoulder stability decreases. Both heads of the biceps have been shown to have a stabilising function in resisting anterior head displacement, and consideration should therefore be given to strengthening the biceps during rehabilitation programmes for chronic anterior instability of the shoulder.},

STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: We used nine fresh cadaveric shoulders with the arm at 90 degrees of abduction and 90 degrees of external rotation. The position of the humeral head was monitored by an electromagnetic tracking device with 0 and 1.5 kg of anterior translation force; with 0, 1, 3, and 5 kg of force applied to each of the anterior, middle, and posterior portions of the deltoid muscle; and with the capsule intact, vented, and with a simulated Bankart lesion. RESULTS: With the capsule intact, anterior displacement was significantly reduced by application of load to the middle deltoid muscle. After the capsule was vented, load application to the anterior, middle, or posterior deltoid muscle significantly reduced anterior displacement. With a simulated Bankart lesion, effects of muscle loading were most apparent: anterior displacement was significantly reduced with loading of each muscle portion. CONCLUSION: The deltoid muscle is an anterior stabilizer of the glenohumeral joint with the arm in abduction and external rotation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The stabilizing function of the deltoid muscle takes on more importance as the shoulder becomes unstable.},

Of these, the plantaris muscle is reported to present a particularly high range of morphological variations. The muscle, passing distally throughout the length of the lower leg, consists of a small muscle belly and a long, thin tendon. It originates, traditionally, on the popliteal surface of the femur and the knee joint capsule, and then inserts to the calcaneal tuberosity. It has been suggested that mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy may be caused by certain plantaris tendon morphologies. This case report describes a new anomalous plantaris tendon insertion, closely related to the Achilles tendon. It comprise four distinct insertions and one direct merge with the calcaneal tendon. The current classification should be extended to accommodate such 'rare cases' to facilitate more successful Achilles tendinopathy treatment.},

  abstract = {Although there is much morphological variation in the anterior compartment of the leg, there is little information about the morphological variability of the fibularis tertius muscle (FTM). The main aim of the present study was to characterize the morphology (origin and insertion) and frequency of occurrence of the FTM and to use these findings as the basis for a new classification of the fibularis tertius tendon. Classical anatomical dissection was performed on 106 lower limbs fixed in 10\% formalin. The presence of the FTM and the morphology of both its origin and its insertion were described. The FTM was present in 91 limbs (85.8\%). Three types of origin were observed: Type 1, the most common type, with its origin on the distal half fibula (67\%); Type 2, with the origin on the distal third fibula (22\%); and Type 3, with an origin from the tendon of the extensor digitorum longus (11\%). In addition, six types of insertion were distinguished. The most common was Type I (45\%), a single distal attachment where the tendon inserts into the shaft of the fifth metatarsal bone. The rarest was Type VI, characterized by fusion with an additional band of the fibularis brevis tendon, which gives rise to the fourth interosseus dorsalis muscle. Two morphological variants of insertion could be distinguished, fan-shaped and band-shaped. Both the origin and insertion of the FTM are very morphologically variable, with three types of origin (Types 1-3) and six types of insertion point (Types I-VI) observed. Knowledge of such variations is essential for both clinicians and anatomists. Clin. Anat. 32:1082-1093, 2019. {\copyright} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {To evaluate anatomic variability in the insertion of the adductor hallucis into the lateral sesamoid and proximal phalanx of the great toe and to evaluate the extent of release of the adductor hallucis tendon performed through an incision in the dorsal first-web space, we recorded the angle of hallux valgus in 42 fresh-frozen specimens from human cadavers. An incision was made for a realignment of the soft tissues, dissecting down to the level of the intermetatarsal ligament. A loop of suture was placed around the identifiable adductor hallucis tendon through this incision along the lateral aspect of the lateral sesamoid. Then a plantar dissection removed all soft tissue to the level of the intermetatarsal ligament, adductor hallucis (transverse and oblique heads), lateral sesamoid, and lateral flexor hallucis brevis. The Insertion of these muscles into the proximal phalanx was evaluated. Specifically, we looked for separate slips of the adductor tendon inserting into the base of the proximal phalanx or separate insertions of the adductor tendon and the tendon of the flexor hallucis brevis muscle. In 33 of the 42 specimens, the entire adductor hallucis tendon had been isolated by the loop of suture through the incision in the dorsal first web. In eight of the remaining nine specimens, a small slip of the tendon (comprising less than 25\% of its substance) had not been included. No specimen was found to have a separate slip of the adductor tendon inserting into the base of the proximal phalanx. Instead, all specimens were found to have only a conjoined insertion of fibers of the adductor hallucis and of the flexor hallucis brevis from the lateral sesamoid into the base of the proximal phalanx. We did not identify a separate tendon-insertion into the proximal phalanx in any specimen. Therefore, great caution should be exercised in releasing an isolated insertion of the adductor tendon from the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe since it may actually represent the conjoined insertion of the lateral flexor hallucis brevis tendon and the adductor tendon. We found that by simply releasing the adductor tendon from its insertion along the lateral aspect of the sesamoid, accomplished through an incision in the dorsal first web, that an adequate release was achieved in most specimens.},

Many anatomical variations of plantaris muscle have been reported previously, including its inconstancy. Evolutional studies strongly suggest that plantaris muscle is a rudimentary muscle that plays minor role in gait biomechanics. However, plantaris muscle seems to have very important proprioceptive role since it has very high density of muscle spindles. Clinically, plantaris muscle is involved in differential diagnosis of posterior leg pain and several pathological entities such as: plantaris muscle rupture, non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy and popliteal artery compression syndrome. Different surgical specialties have recognized plantaris muscle tendon as a valuable graft. However, literature on plantaris muscle tendon biomechanical properties is rather scant and inconsistent with several limitations for proper data comparison and interpretation. Further comparative studies are needed to properly define biomechanical properties of plantaris muscle tendon grafts for various ligament and tendon reconstructive procedures.},
