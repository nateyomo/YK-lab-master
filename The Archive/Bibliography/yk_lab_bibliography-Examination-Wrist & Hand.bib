  abstract = {PURPOSE: Eliciting tenderness in the region of the ulnar fovea is a possibly useful clinical test for defining the source of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Until now, no reports of the clinical sensitivity and specificity of this test have been available. Based on anecdotal observations, a hypothesis was developed stating that ulnar fovea tenderness (positive "ulnar fovea sign") is sensitive and specific in detecting two ulnar-sided wrist conditions: foveal disruption of the distal radioulnar ligaments and ulnotriquetral (UT) ligament injuries. METHODS: The clinical records of 272 consecutive patients with wrist arthroscopy performed by the senior author from 1998 through to 2005 were reviewed. Relevant clinical and surgical data were abstracted. The ulnar fovea sign test is executed by pressing the examiner's thumb distally into the interval between the ulnar styloid process and flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, between the volar surface of the ulnar head and the pisiform. A positive ulnar fovea sign is designated when there is exquisite tenderness that the patient claims replicates their pain, with comparisons made with the contralateral side. RESULTS: There were a total of 90 foveal disruptions and 68 UT ligament injuries diagnosed during wrist arthroscopy. The ulnar fovea sign was positive in 156 patients. The sensitivity of the fovea sign in detecting foveal disruptions and/or UT ligament injuries was 95.2\%. Its specificity was 86.5\%. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis stating that the ulnar fovea sign is a useful clinical maneuver to detect foveal disruptions and UT ligament tears is supported. The conditions represent 2 common sources of ulnar-sided wrist pain. The differentiation between the 2 conditions may be made clinically, where UT ligament tears are typically associated with a stable distal radioulnar joint and foveal disruptions are typically associated with an unstable distal radioulnar joint. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic II.},
