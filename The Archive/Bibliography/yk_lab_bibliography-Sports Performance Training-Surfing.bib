  abstract = {Lower body and core muscular strength are essential for optimal performance in many sports and competitive surfers have similar strength demands when maneuvering a surfboard to achieve competition success. Presently, the use of unstable surfaces is excessively utilized by surf coaches and trainers and to date, research does not support this as an effective training method for long-term improvements. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an 8-week Core Strength Training Program (CSTP) on a battery of field tests specific to assessing core musculature and lower body strength for junior competitive surf athletes. Nineteen American junior competitive surf athletes (age:15.7{\textpm}1.01yrs, height:1.77{\textpm}0.007m, mass:64.67{\textpm}9.08kg) completed pre- and post-tests with a transitional pre-season to in-season 8-week CSTP intervention. The battery of tests included: rotational power (RP), time to peak acceleration (TP), maximal acceleration (Ma), maximal countermovement jump (CMJ), estimated peak power (PP), core strength (CS), core endurance (CE), and rotational flexibility (RF). Means, standard deviations, RMANOVA with a significance level of p {$<$} 0.05, and effect sizes were computed. Results demonstrated significant improvements in L.RP, TP, CMJ, PP, CS, and RF. Based on the results, the CSTP is an effective training program for surf coaches and strength and conditioning professionals to improve strength in the core musculature and lower body. In addition, we conclude implementation of the CSTP enhances athletic performance measurements which will likely increase competition success.},

Maximal strength training improves surfboard sprint and endurance paddling performance in competitive and recreational surfers. J Strength Cond Res 31(1): 244-253, 2017-Upper-body (UB) strength has very high correlations with faster surfboard paddling speeds. However, there is no research examining the effects of improving UB strength has on surfboard paddling ability. This study aimed to determine the influence that improvements in UB closed-kinetic chain maximal strength have on surfboard paddling in both competitive and recreational surfers. Seventeen competitive and recreational male surfers (29.7 {\textpm} 7.7 years, 177.4 {\textpm} 7.4 cm, 76.7 {\textpm} 9.9 kg) participated in a repeated-measures, parallel control study design. Anthropometry; 5-, 10-, and 15-m sprint; and 400-m endurance surfboard paddling tests along with pull-up and dip 1 repetition maximum strength tests were assessed pre- and postintervention. Subjects in the training group performed 5 weeks of maximal strength training in the pull-up and dip. Differences between the training and control groups were examined postintervention. The training group increased their speed over the 5-, 10-, and 15-m sprint, whereas the control group became slower (d = 0.71, 0.51, and 0.4, respectively). The training group also displayed faster endurance paddling performance compared with the control group (d = 0.72). Short-term exposure to maximal strength training elicits improvements in paddling performance measures. However, the magnitude of performance increases seems to be dependent on initial strength levels with differential responses between strong and weaker athletes. Although a longer maximal strength training period may have produced more significant paddling improvements in stronger subjects, practitioners are unlikely to have any more than 5 weeks in an uninterrupted block with competitive surfing athletes. This study reveals that a "threshold" level of maximal strength that if possessed, short-term maximal strength training may only provide little improvement in paddling performance.},

A secondary objective of this study is to further compare the physical capacities and abilities that may differentiate between the competitive levels of surfing. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: Twelve junior-elite (currently competing at a state level or higher and 12-18 years of age), twelve senior-elite (currently competing at a national level and/or the World Qualifying Series and over 16 years of age), and twelve recreational surfers (minimum of two years surfing experience; actively surfing at least once a week and over 18 years of age) were recruited for this study. All participants completed a pre-exercise medical questionnaire, anthropometric assessment, ankle dorsiflexion range of motion assessment, medial-lateral ankle proprioception assessment, countermovement jump, squat jump, isometric mid-thigh pull and drop-and-stick. RESULTS: Senior-elite surfers had large and significantly better ankle proprioception and range of motion than junior-elite and recreational surfers. However, the relationship between years of surf-specific experience and ankle proprioception was small and non-significant. Better drop-and-stick performance, indicated by lower relative peak force, was present in the senior-elite compared to the junior-elite and recreational groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that medial-lateral ankle proprioception is a distinguishing characteristic of senior-elite surfers and therefore, may be a critical ability for competitive success. Greater ankle range of motion and the ability to attenuate energy to reduce landing force may be developed through long-term training commensurate with competitive surfing.},

Relationship between the type of surfing practiced and the onset of pain is not fully understood as well as the potential role of rehabilitation in preventing it. OBJECTIVE: To investigate musculoskeletal pain and to deepen whether the age and the anatomical region involved influenced the pain appearance in relation to four surfing disciplines. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out. An online survey was addressed to a group of Italian surfers (practicing surf, kitesurf, windsurf and stand up paddle since at least 1 year), collecting demographic data, discipline practiced, location of musculoskeletal pain. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six surfers were involved in the study. Spine and upper limbs pain was more frequent compared to lower limbs one in the surf (p{$<$} 0.001) and in the windsurf groups (p= 0.007). In the kitesurf group a greater prevalence of pain was observed in spine and lower limbs compared to upper limbs (p= 0.017). Low back pain is the most represented among the spine pain subgroups (p{$<$} 0.001). Pain was lower in younger athletes (p= 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding risk factors and biomechanics of musculoskeletal pain is essential to realize prevention training strategies. Rehabilitation in sinergy with specific training allows pain-free activity, optimizing its overall health benefits.},

Twenty-four competitive adolescent surfers (19 male, 5 female; age = 14.4 {\textpm} 1.3 years, mass: 50.1 {\textpm} 10.7 kg, and stature: 159.9 {\textpm} 10.3 cm) were assigned to perform either 5 weeks of SIT and HIT. Participants completed a repeated-sprint paddle ability test (RSPT, 15-m surfboard sprint paddle initiated every 40 seconds {\texttimes} 10 bouts) and 400-m endurance surfboard paddle time trial before and after training. High-intensity interval training decreased the total time to complete the 400 m by 15.8 {\textpm} 16.1 seconds (p = 0.03), and SIT decreased the total time to complete the RSPT by 6.5 {\textpm} 4.3 seconds (p = 0.02). Fatigue index during the RSPT (first-slowest effort) was lower after HIT and SIT (p {$\leq$} 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively). There were no significant differences in performance changes in the 400 m (total time) and RSPT (total time, fastest 15 m time, and peak velocity) between HIT and SIT. Our study indicates that HIT and SIT may be implemented to the training program of surfers to improve aerobic and repeat-sprint paddle ability, both of which are identified as key aspects of the sport. In addition, these findings indicate that 400-m paddle and RSPT can discriminate between aerobic and anaerobic training adaptations, with aerobic gains likely from HIT and anaerobic gains from SIT.},

J Strength Cond Res 31(1): 260-271, 2017-Despite the increased professionalism and substantial growth of surfing worldwide, there is limited information available to practitioners and coaches in terms of key performance analytics that are common in other field-based sports. Indeed, research analyzing surfing performance is limited to a few studies examining male surfers' heart rates, surfing activities through time-motion analysis (TMA) using video recordings and Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) data during competition and recreational surfing. These studies have indicated that specific activities undertaken during surfing are unique with a variety of activities (i.e., paddling, resting, wave riding, breath holding, and recovery of surfboard in the surf). Furthermore, environmental and wave conditions also seem to influence the physical demands of competition surfing. It is due to these demands that surfers are required to have a high cardiorespiratory fitness, high muscular endurance, and considerable strength and anaerobic power, particular within the upper torso. By exploring various methods of performance analysis used within other sports, it is possible to improve our understanding of surfing demands. In so doing this will assist in the development of protocols and strategies to assess physiological characteristics of surfers, monitor athlete performance, improve training prescription, and identify talent. Therefore, this review explores the current literature to provide insights into methodological protocols, delimitations of research into athlete analysis and an overview of surfing dynamics. Specifically, this review will describe and review the use of TMA, GPS, and other technologies (i.e., HR) that are used in external and internal load monitoring as they pertain to surfing.},

In addition, comparisons between locations and surfers competing in the same heats were performed. Global Positioning System and video data were collected from 41 male competitive surfers (23.2 {\textpm} 6.1 years, 71 {\textpm} 10.3 kg, 177.2 {\textpm} 6.4 cm) participating in 3 professional domestic surfing events, with competitive heats of 20-minute duration. Fifty data sets were analyzed across the 3 competitions, with velocities and distances covered, proportion of time spent performing various surfing activities, and total work-to-relief ratio determined. Results revealed surfers paddled 44\% of the total time, followed by stationary periods (42\%). Surfers performed at a significantly (p {$\leq$} 0.05) higher work-to-relief ratio (1.7:1) at the beach-break (an exposed beach) compared with point-break 1 and 2 (waves breaking around a rocky point). Point-breaks 1 and 2 had longer continuous durations of paddling, with significantly longer rides at point-break 1 over the beach-break (p {$\leq$} 0.01) and point-break 2 (p {$\leq$} 0.01). The average maximal speed (24.8 km{$\cdot$}h) from point-break 2 was significantly faster than point-break 1 (p {$\leq$} 0.01) and beach-break (p {$\leq$} 0.05). This information should influence surfing drills and conditioning methods to prepare these athletes for the disparate demands, such as training for a point-break competition involving longer durations of continuous paddling and short, high-intensity workloads for a beach-break.},

Twenty competitive surfers were divided according to the competitive level as follows: international (INT) or national (NAT), and competitive ranking (RANK1-50 or RANK51-100). Vertical jump and maximal peak power of the lower limbs were measured. No differences were found between INT and NAT surfers in the anthropometric variables, in the vertical jump, or in lower extremity power; although the NAT group had higher levels on the elasticity index, squat jumps (SJs), and counter movement jumps (CMJs) compared with the INT group. The RANK1-50 group had a lower biceps skinfold (p {$<$} 0.01), lower skinfolds in the legs (Front thigh: p {$\leq$} 0.05; medial calf: p {$<$} 0.01), lower sum of skinfolds (p {$\leq$} 0.05), higher SJ (p {$<$} 0.01), CMJ (p {$<$} 0.01), and 15 seconds vertical CMJ (p {$\leq$} 0.05); also, maximal peak power of the right leg (MPPR) and left leg (MPPL) were higher in the RANK1-50 group. Moderate to large significant correlations were obtained between the surfers' ranking position and some skinfolds, the sum of skinfolds, and vertical jump. Results demonstrate that surfers' physical performance seems to be an accurate indicator of ranking positioning, also revealing that vertical jump capacity and anthropometric variables play an important role in their competitive performance, which may be important when considering their power training.},

Fourteen surfers (age 20.6~{\textpm}~5.7~years, height 178.1~{\textpm}~9.50 cm, mass 70.6~{\textpm}~10.8 kg) had their lower limb mobility, squat jump, countermovement jump, and drop-and-stick landing performance assessed. Performance of two aerial variations (Frontside Air (FA) and Frontside Air Reverse (FAR)) was also measured, with variables relating to technical performance (critical feature and subjective ratings) and potential injury risk (relative total peak landing force and loading rates) collected. Multiple linear regressions were used to predict performance of both aerial variations based on a subset of independent variables. Four models could predict performance. Predicted technical capability in the FAR was mostly influenced by lead limb hip extension and lead limb knee flexion range of motion. Potential injury risk when surfers perform an FA and FAR was predicted to be mitigated by increasing lead ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, as well as trail hip extensor mobility to reduce the relative total peak force experienced when landing the FA. These simple outcome measures could be routinely assessed to ensure successful and safe aerial landings in surfing.},

Although some components of the sport are well understood, evidence-based recommendations in the scientific literature on how to perform surfing skills are sparse. The aim of this article was to systematically review the body of literature pertaining to discrete wave-riding skills and characteristics that are associated with the ability of surfers to successfully perform them. Searches of PubMed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus with Full-text, and Web of Science were undertaken in January 2019, to identify the most appropriate literature, with secondary searches of reference lists used to create a greater pool of possible articles. The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Ten studies deemed appropriate for review captured data from 299 surfers, who were predominantly competitive (78.3\%) and male (58.2\%). The average Down and Black Quality Index of the articles was 76.3 {\textpm} 8.4\%, with these articles focusing on the "pop-up" and landing skills. Performance indicators, such as isometric push-up peak forces, force-plate derived and in-water time to pop-up, relative peak forces generated when landing and time-to-stabilization, were all shown to be related to the physical characteristics of surfers and could affect the ability of surfers to successfully ride a wave. Findings from the studies included in this review suggest that the pop-up and landing exhibit trainable qualities that coaches and athletes can use to improve surfing performance.},

Fifteen competitive surfers (age 20.3~{\textpm}~5.6~years, height 178.2~{\textpm}~9.16 cm, mass 71.0~{\textpm}~10.5 kg) performed a Frontside Air (FA) and Frontside Air Reverse (FAR), while we collected the impact forces, ankle and knee muscle activity, and kinematic data. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce 41 dependent variables into 10 components. A two-way MANOVA revealed that although there were no limb x aerial variation interactions, surfers generated significantly higher relative loading rates at landing for the trail limb compared to the lead limb (+28.8 BW/s; F(1,303)~=~20.660, p {$<~$}0.0001, {$\eta$}2~=~0.064). This was likely due to the surfers "slapping" the trail limb down when landing, rather than controlling placement of the limb. Similarly, higher relative loading rates were generated when landing the FA compared to the FAR (+23.6 BW/s; F(1,303)~=~31.655, p {$<~$}0.0001, {$\eta$}2~=~0.095), due to less time over which the forces could be dissipated. No relationships between aerial variation or limb were found for any of the kinematic or muscle activity data. Practitioners should consider the higher relative loading rates generated by a surfer's trail limb and when surfers perform a FA when designing dry-land training to improve the aerial performance of surfing athletes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Physical preparation of competitive surfers includes substantial dry-land training. It is currently unknown, however, how closely these exercises replicate surfing maneuvers performed in the ocean. This study compared the technique features displayed by surfers when landing simulated aerial maneuvers on land to critical features previously established as necessary for surfers to successfully land aerials in the ocean during competition. METHODS: Fourteen competitive surfers (age 20.6~{\textpm}~5.7~years, height 178.1~{\textpm}~9.50~cm, mass 70.6~{\textpm}~10.8~kg) were recruited to perform two variations of a simulated aerial task, a Frontside Air (FA) and Frontside Air Reverse (FAR). Joint ranges of motion (ROM), center of pressure, and apparent gaze data were collected during the landing event. Paired t tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to identify any significant differences in the outcome variables between the two aerial tasks. RESULTS: Participants displayed 100\% and 60\% of the critical features associated with successfully landing a FA and FAR, respectively. In both the simulated FA and FAR, participants landed in 1.0-3.7{$^\circ$} of dorsiflexion, moving through significantly less ankle joint ROM in the lead limb during the FAR (P~{$<~$}.01). Participants also displayed significantly less knee and hip ROM (P~=~.002-.048) while landing the FAR compared to the FA. CONCLUSION: The simulated FA and FAR tasks are appropriate training tools for surfers to replicate most of the critical features that a surfer should display to successfully land aerial maneuvers in the ocean. These tasks therefore enable surfers to practice these complex movements in a controlled environment.},

Four different surfboard fins, including conventional, single-grooved, and double-grooved fins, were developed using computer-aided design combined with additive manufacturing (3D printing). We systematically installed these 3D-printed fins into instrumented surfboards, which six accomplished surfers rode on waves in the ocean in a random order while blinded to the fin condition. We quantified the surfers' wave-riding performance during each surfing bout using a sport-specific tracking device embedded in each instrumented surfboard. After each fin condition, the surfers rated their perceptions of the Drive, Feel, Hold, Speed, Stiffness, and Turnability they experienced while performing turns using a visual analogue scale. Relationships between the surfer's perceptions of the fins and their surfing performance data collected from the tracking devices were then examined. The results revealed that participants preferred the single-grooved fins for Speed and Feel, followed by double-grooved fins, commercially available fins, and conventional fins without grooves. Crucially, the surfers' perceptions of their performance matched the objective data from the embedded sensors. Our findings demonstrate that accomplished surfers can perceive how changes to surfboard fins influence their surfing performance.},

METHODS: Medical literature was queried for all reports of this condition, systematically abstracted, and analyzed. An illustrative case that provides the most definitive support for a vascular cause is presented. Treatment considerations based on prior cases and expert opinions are provided. RESULTS: Sixty-four cases of surfer's myelopathy have been reported to date. This atraumatic thoracic/conus medullaris myelopathy with only a 42\% neurological recovery rate almost uniformly affects young, healthy, novice surfers who have no pre-existent spinal disease. Symptoms usually start with back pain and rapidly progress to complete or incomplete myelopathy. T2 magnetic resonance images show increased signal in the central spinal cord within 24 to 72 hours. Gadolinium enhancement and diffusion-weighted imaging are not helpful. Angiography has been underused. Angiogram in our case showed the absence of a right T12 radicular artery and no artery of Adamkiewicz, which, along with clinical findings, support the vascular origin theory. Incomplete cases often improve within 24 hours of onset, whereas no improvement has been reported for American Spinal Injury Association class A cases. Several acute interventions have been tried. Steroids are most common, and patients receiving steroids improved 55\% of the time with no reported adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Surfer's myelopathy is a clinical entity associated with complete deficit in {$>$}50\% of cases. Its prognosis is almost exclusively dictated by severity at presentation/nadir. Thus, publicizing this rare but serious condition (within and outside the medical literature) may be an effective intervention.},

We hypothesized that wave direction and surf stance interact in creating favourable or debilitative performance demands as surfers are either facing the wave (frontside) or the wave is breaking in the back of the surfers (backside). Study 1 was an online survey collecting self-report data of recreational surfers (n\,=\,394). In Study 2, we analysed all wave scores (n\,=\,2,552) and laterality of professional surfers during the season of 2014. Study 1 demonstrated that recreational surfers preferred surfing frontside and described themselves as more skilful when surfing frontside as this is facilitative for picking up visual information. Study 2 did not provide clear evidence that professional surfers on average scored higher during contests when surfing frontside, but when professional surfers had a choice of surfing frontside vs. backside, they were more likely to surf frontside. We discuss the diverging findings between Study 1 and Study 2 from the "circumvention-of-limits" argumentation within the expertise literature as professional surfers most likely have acquired skills allowing them to compensate for debilitative individual and environmental circumstances.},

Concurrent validity is based on the comparison of the HALO{\copyright} and inclinometer. To determine if active range of motion (AROM) differences exists between prone and supine when assessing shoulder internal (IR) and external rotation (ER). DESIGN: The design included clinical measurement, reliability and validity. METHODS: Thirty shoulders (mean age = 26.8 years) without pathology were evaluated. Measurements were taken in supine and prone with both an inclinometer and HALO{\copyright} device. RESULTS: Active ER ROM in prone was significantly higher than in supine when using both devices. Intra-rater reliability (within and between session) intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values ranged between 0.82-0.99 for both devices in supine and prone. An ICC test revealed a significant (p {$<$} 0.01) correlation for both devices in IR and ER movements (ICC3,1 = 0.87 and ICC3,1 = 0.72), respectively. CONCLUSION: This study has shown prone assessment of active ER and IR ROM to be a reliable and appropriate method for prone dominant athletes (swimmers and surfers). In this study greater ER ROM was achieved in prone compared to supine. This finding highlights the importance of standardizing the test position for initial and follow up assessments.

DESIGN: Clinical Measurement, reliability and comparative study. METHODS: A total of 30 subjects were used to determine the reliability component. 15 elite surfers were used as part of a comparative analysis with age and gender matched controls. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficient values ranged between 0.95-0.99 (95\% CI; 0.89-0.99) for both thoracic methods.

CONCLUSION: This study has illustrated reliable methods to assess the thoracic spine in the sagittal plane and thoracic rotation. It has also quantified ROM in a surfing cohort; identifying thoracic rotation as a key movement.

Surf-specific physiological studies lack adequate group sample sizes, and V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak values are yet to determine the differences between competitive and recreational surfers. The purpose of this study was therefore to provide a comprehensive physiological profile of both recreational and competitive surfers. This multisite study involved 62 male surfers, recreational (n = 47) and competitive (n = 15). Anthropometric measurements were conducted followed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, anaerobic testing and finally aerobic testing. V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak was significantly greater in competitive surfers than in recreational surfers (M = 40.71 {\textpm} 3.28 vs. 31.25 {\textpm} 6.31 ml{$\cdot$}kg{$\cdot$}min, p {$<$} 0.001). This was also paralleled for anaerobic power (M = 303.93 vs. 264.58 W) for competitive surfers. Arm span and lean total muscle mass was significantly (p {$\leq$} 0.01) correlated with key performance variables (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and anaerobic power). No significant (p {$\geq$} 0.05) correlations were revealed between season rank and each of the variables of interest (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and anaerobic power). Key performance variables (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and anaerobic power) are significantly higher in competitive surfers, indicating that this is both an adaptation and requirement in this cohort. This battery of physiological tests could be used as a screening tool to identify an athlete's weaknesses or strengths. Coaches and clinicians could then select appropriate training regimes to address weaknesses.},

  abstract = {Context: Surfer's myelopathy (SM) is an acute syndrome identified by nontraumatic paraparesis or paraplegia. Though traditionally tied to first-time surfers, the condition encompasses any activity involving hyperextension of the back such as gymnastics, yoga, and Pilates.Methods: MEDLINE{\textregistered} and Google Scholar literature searches were gathered to identify relevant case reports for determining the etiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of SM.Results: While the rare nature of SM limits its full understanding, studies have pinpointed that hyperextension in the back leads to vasculature insufficiency secondary to dynamic compression of the artery of Adamkiewicz. In surfing, this hyperextension combined with the execution of the Valsalva maneuver while trying to stand up on the surfboard likely increases intraspinal pressure. Due to its nontraumatic origin, the presence of SM is not immediately clear. Moreover, its similarity in clinical and radiological presentations with other entities can further complicate diagnosis. Seemingly, idiopathic urological symptoms can be explained by the physician if they conduct a thorough history.Conclusion: In an effort to raise awareness for the practicing physician, we presently review the etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prolonged effects of SM. With the surging popularity of surfing as well as the advent of children participating in precarious sports and activities at an earlier age, we can expect a rising incidence of traumatic and nontraumatic spinal cord injuries. Neurologists, urologists, emergency medicine and sports medicine physicians alike can utilize this review to build a high index of suspicion for SM. The risk factors for SM should be conveyed to those participating in novices in surfing, yoga, gymnastics, ballet, and any activity enabling sustained or repeated spinal extension. Increased general awareness will facilitate increased symptom recognition in order to arrest aggravation of injury.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Literature regarding surfing injuries is scarce and most studies report a high number of minor injuries. Recent literature suggests that musculoskeletal injuries are more common than previously reported. In the mid 2000s, competitive surfing has seen an increase in aerial maneuvers, as they have become more highly rewarded by the judging panel, which may be contributing to a change in injury patterns. Our goal was to evaluate orthopedic injuries in professional surfers. HYPOTHESIS: Orthopedic injuries in professional surfers are diverse and have evolved with skill and technology. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4 Case Series. METHODS: Medical records of professional surfers from a single orthopedic center between 1991 and 2016 were reviewed. Injuries sustained while surfing and chronic injuries related to surfing were included. Site of injury, diagnosis, and treatment were recorded along with demographic data. RESULTS: In total, 163 injuries in 86 athletes were recorded. The median injury age was 28.5 years (range 12-62 years) and 92.6\% of patients were male. The most frequently injured body parts were the knee (28.2\%), ankle (22.1\%), and shoulder (19\%). Most knee injuries were of the medial collateral ligament at 49\%, with 75\% of ankle injuries being sprains, and in shoulder, 48\% had instability, 42\% had a rotator cuff tear, and 35\% had a superior anterior-posterior labral tear. Lower extremity injuries primarily affected the surfers' back leg (72.5\%). In all, 34.6\% of all injuries required surgical intervention and involved shoulder injuries most the time. CONCLUSIONS: The most common orthopedic injuries in professional surfers involve the knee, ankle, shoulder, hip, and back. Surfers' rear extremities were preferentially injured which is the extremity responsible for power and torque. Shoulder injuries increased the probability of an operative intervention. Last, overuse injuries (femoral-acetabular impingement, rotator cuffs) occurred in the older surf population compared with more acute injuries (ankle sprains/fractures, anterior cruciate ligament tears) which is also consistent with time to surgery.},

Eleven competitive surfing athletes aged 24~{\textpm}~7~years participated, and inertial motion sensors were fixed to the anterior aspect of the feet, mid-tibial shafts, sacrum and eighth thoracic vertebrae on these athletes. Three tasks were performed landing on force plates and two tasks in a modified gymnastics set-up used for land-based aerial training. Peak landing force, resultant peak acceleration and front and rear side ankle dorsiflexion ranges of motion during landing were determined. The peak acceleration was approximately 50\% higher when performing aerial training using a mini-trampoline and landing on a soft-density foam board, compared to a similar landing off a 50~cm box. Furthermore, the ankle ranges of motion during the gymnastic type landings were significantly lower than the other landing types (P~{$\leq~$}0.05 and P~{$\leq~$}0.001), for front and rear sides, respectively. Conclusively, increased task complexity and specificity of the sport increased the tibial peak acceleration, indicating greater training load.},

However, few studies have provided a synthesis of all available literature. The purpose of this study was to obtain, critique and synthesise all literature specific to acute surfing injuries, and evaluate differences in injury type, mechanism and location between HCF and survey data. A systematic literature review design was used to identify relevant articles from three major databases. Peer-reviewed epidemiological studies of musculoskeletal surfing injuries were included. A modified AXIS tool was used for critical appraisal, and objective data was extracted and synthesized by lead researchers. Overall frequencies for injury location, type and mechanism were calculated from raw injury data. A total of 19 cross-sectional articles of fair to good quality (Modified AXIS 54.2-83.3\%) were included in this study; 17 were National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) level III-2 (retrospective) and two were level II (prospective). Articles examined competitive, recreational and combined populations. Injury data from Australia, Brazil, UK, USA, Portugal, Japan, Norway, and worldwide were represented. Skin (46.0\%; HCF 50.1\%, survey 43.8\%) and being struck by own surfboard (38.6\%; HCF 73.4\%, survey 36.7\%) were the most common injury type and mechanism. Head, face and neck injuries were most common in HCF (43.1\%) versus lower limb injuries (36.4\%) in survey data. Incidence proportion was highest in aerialists (0.48). Incidence rate (number of injuries per 1000 h) ranged from 0.74 in Australian surfers (Melbourne) to 6.6 in international contest surfers from medical record data. This review highlights the prevalence of skin, board-related, head, face and neck, and lower limb surfing injuries across available literature. Proposed use of protective equipment and foam-based surfboards in dangerous or crowded surf locations may reduce injury risk.},

  abstract = {This study compared determinants of a 30-s all-out paddling effort (30-s sprint-paddling test) between junior surfboard riders (surfers) of varying ability. Eight competitive (COMP) and 8 recreational (REC) junior male surfers performed a 30-s sprint-paddling test for the determination of peak sprint power and accumulated O2 deficit. Surfers also performed an incremental-paddling test for the determination of the O2 uptake-power output relationship that was subsequently used to calculate the accumulated O2 deficit for the 30-s sprint-paddling test. During the 30-s sprint-paddling test, peak sprint power (404 {\textpm} 98 vs 292 {\textpm} 56 W, respectively, P = .01) and the accumulated O2 deficit (1.60 {\textpm} 0.31 vs 1.14 {\textpm} 0.38 L, respectively, P = .02) were greater in COMP than in REC surfers, whereas peak O2 uptake measured during the incremental-paddling test was not different (2.7 {\textpm} 0.1 vs 2.5 {\textpm} 0.2 L/min, respectively, P = .11). The higher peak sprint power and larger accumulated O2 deficit observed in COMP than in REC surfers during a 30-s sprint paddling test suggest that surfing promotes development of the anaerobic energy systems. Furthermore, peak sprint power determined during 30 s of sprint paddling may be considered a sensitive measure of surfing ability or experience in junior male surfers.},

  abstract = {Surfing has rapidly grown in popularity as the sport made its debut at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Surfing injuries are becoming more relevant with the globalisation and increasing risks of the sport, but despite this, little is known about surfing injuries or prevention strategies in either the competitive or recreational surfer. Prior research demonstrates that surfers are injured at a frequency of 0.74-1.79 injuries per 1000 hours of surfing. We reviewed the literature for the incidence, anatomical distribution, type and underlying mechanism of acute and overuse injuries, and discuss current preventative measures. This review finds that skin injuries represent the highest proportion of total injuries. Acute injuries most frequently affect the head, neck and face, followed by the lower limbs. Being struck by one's own board is the most common mechanism of injury. Non-contact acute ligament injuries have increased as surfing manoeuvres have become more acrobatic and overuse musculoskeletal injuries are highly correlated with paddling. However, there is a paucity of research for surfing injuries, and studies on overuse musculoskeletal injuries and prevention are disproportionally under-represented. Most of the prior studies are limited by small sample sizes, poor data collection methodology and geographical constraints. Further research is needed to establish preventative measures for both acute and overuse surfing injuries and to ensure the increasing popularity of surfing is met with an improved understanding of sport risks and safety. Specifically, we recommend research be prioritised regarding the efficacy of training programmes to prevent surfing-related overuse musculoskeletal injuries.},

This study evaluated surfers' activity times at the Portuguese surfing championship in order to account for the time spent in each surfing activity. METHODS: Eighty-seven individually recorded videos of surfers were analyzed, showing their activity over the entire heat, and video analysis software was used to obtain each surfer's activity profile in the competition. RESULTS: The results breakdown by time percentage show that the surfers were paddling 50.9\% of the time, sprint paddling for wave 1.9\%, were stationary 34.1\% of the time, wave riding 3.7\%, and involved in miscellaneous activities (e.g., duck diving, board recovery, etc.) 9.4\% of the total time. Average times spent in each surfing activity were 18.6 seconds for paddling, 2.9 seconds for sprint paddling for a wave, 21.7 seconds for the stationary period, 11.5 seconds for wave riding, and 6.9 seconds for miscellaneous activities. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed that the most performed heat activity was paddling, allowing us to conclude that surfing is basically a long-arm paddling activity and that this activity constitutes a specific surfing competition demand, which in turn means that individual surfer's data can be used as a starting point for the development of tailored conditioning training programs.},

Hence, coaches and athletes have recognised the importance of physical preparation to enhance athletic performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a sport-specific, land-based-home exercise programme (LB-HEP) on sport-specific assessments related to surfing performance in recreational surfers. Twenty-two year-round recreational surfers divided into two groups: the exercise group (EG) performed the LB-HEP 3 times a week for 8\,weeks while the control group (CG) maintained their current exercise. Both groups were instructed to continue surfing during the study period. Each surfer completed sport-specific measurements related to surfing demands both pre-test and post-test (8\,weeks). There was a significant interactive effect of time and group (p\,=\,.009, {$\eta$}p2 =.298) on the surfer's performance questionnaire showing greater improvements in the EG. Additionally, the EG had an improvement on time to pop-up when compared to the CG ({$\eta$}p2 =.160). Based on the results, the LB-HEP is an effective training programme for all experience levels of recreational surfers to improve surfing performance measures short term.},

Furthermore, the study aimed to compare pop-up performance between stronger and weaker surfers. Eighteen female (n = 9) and male (n = 9) surfers (age = 28.1 {\textpm} 6.4 years, mass = 69.6 {\textpm} 10.4 kg, and height = 172.5 {\textpm} 6.7 cm) completed a battery of upper-body strength assessments, of which exhibited high between-day reliability: IPU, (coefficient of variation [CV\%] = 4.7, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96), DPU (CV\% = 5.0, ICC = 0.90), and FP POP (CV\% = 4.4, ICC = 0.90). Participants were subsequently split into stronger (n = 9) and weaker (n = 9) surfers based on normalized peak force (PF) attained in the IPU. Pop-up performance was measured both in the water and during the FP POP and was referred to as time to pop-up (TTP). Significant between-group differences were observed for normalized PF during IPU (d = 1.59, p {$<$} 0.01) and DPU (d = 0.94 p = 0.04). Although not significant, there was a large magnitude difference in FP POP (d = 0.80, p = 0.08) and FP TTP (d = 0.85, p = 0.07). Significant correlations were identified between normalized IPU PF and normalized DPU FP (r = 0.69, p = 0.03) and FP TTP (r = 0.73, p = 0.02) in the stronger group. The weaker group exhibited a significant inverse correlation between normalized IPU PF and in-water TTP (r = -0.77, p {$<$} 0.01). The results suggest improvements in pop-up performance may be elicited by improving dynamic strength for stronger surfers, whereas pop-up performance in weaker surfers may be elicited by improving maximum strength. The upper-body strength assessments provided a novel insight into strength qualities that are associated with in-water performance of surfers (TTP).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are approximately 2.1 million recreational surfers in the United States. However, little has been reported on surfing-related injuries and, to date, no study has utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize injury patterns. OBJECTIVE: To use MRI to perform a descriptive analysis of surfing injuries in patients who presented to an urban tertiary care musculoskeletal hospital. This was not a hypothesis-driven study. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. METHODS: A retrospective review of the picture archiving and communication system as well as the electronic medical record was performed to identify patients with surfing-related injuries who presented to a tertiary care musculoskeletal hospital for treatment. The search included participants over a 10-year period who presented between January 1, 2009, and August 1, 2018. Descriptive data analyses were performed to determine frequency of body part injured, diagnosis, and operative versus nonoperative treatment. RESULTS: The search yielded 109 patients with surfing-related injuries and MRIs. A total of 90 patients presented within 6 months of their surfing injury and were included in the final analysis. The median age was 36 years (range, 12-66 years). A majority of the patients included were male (74\%; n = 67). Acute surfing injuries were diagnosed via imaging in 72\% (n = 65) of patients. The joints injured most commonly were the shoulder (46\%; n = 30) and the knee (28\%; n = 18). Only 17\% (n = 11) of acute surfing injuries required surgery, while 83\% (n = 54) were treated nonoperatively. CONCLUSION: The most common surfing-related injuries occurred in the shoulder and knee. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study helps characterize the risk of injury for surfers and informs healthcare providers on common surfing injuries.},

This study investigated the duration, mechanisms, body locations and types of gradual-onset injuries in a sample of New Zealand surfers. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional online survey. METHODS: Self-identified surfers reported gradual-onset surfing-related injuries experienced in the preceding 12 months. RESULTS: Respondents (n=1473, age range 8-74 years) reported a total of 550 gradual-onset major injuries: 44\% acute duration ({$<$}3 months) and 56\% chronic ({$\geq$}3 months). The injury incidence proportion was 27\%. Shoulder (146 injuries, 64\% chronic), low back (115 injuries, 58\% chronic) and neck (105 injuries, 46\% chronic) were the most commonly reported injury locations. Prolonged paddling was the most commonly reported mechanism of injury (40\% of all injuries). Incidence proportion for gradual-onset major injuries was 6\% higher for greater surfing abilities compared to lower abilities (p=0.01), and 13\% higher for long boarders compared to short boarders (p=0.001). Respondents reporting any gradual-onset surfing injury, compared to those with no injury, averaged 3 more years surfing experience (p{$<$}0.001), were 3 years older (p{$<$}0.001), and reported 43h more surfing exposure in the preceding 12 months (p{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The most common gradual-onset surfing injuries involved the shoulder, low back, and neck, most frequently attributable to paddling. Risk factors for these injuries included board type, higher ability, older age, more hours/year, and years of surfing. These findings affirm the existence of sufficient injury burden to justify investigation of surfing injury prevention initiatives.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify whether there are any significant differences in the lower-body muscle structure and countermovement-jump (CMJ) and squat-jump (SJ) performance between stronger and weaker surfing athletes. METHODS: Twenty elite male surfers had their lower-body muscle structure assessed with ultrasonography and completed a series of lower-body strength and jump tests including isometric midthigh pull (IMTP), CMJ, and SJ. Athletes were separated into stronger (n = 10) and weaker (n = 10) groups based on IMTP performance. RESULTS: Large significant differences were identified between the groups for vastus lateralis (VL) thickness (P = .02, ES = 1.22) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) pennation angle (P = .01, ES = 1.20), and a large nonsignificant difference was identified in LG thickness (P = .08, ES = 0.89). Furthermore, significant differences were present between the groups for peak force, relative peak force, and jump height in the CMJ and SJ (P {$<$} .01-.05, ES = 0.90-1.47) and eccentric peak velocity, as well as vertical displacement of the center of mass during the CMJ (P {$<$} .01, ES = 1.40-1.41). CONCLUSION: Stronger surfing athletes in this study had greater VL and LG thickness and LG pennation angle. These muscle structures may explain their better performance in the CMJ and SJ. A unique finding in this study was that the stronger group appeared to better use their strength and muscle structure for braking as they had significantly higher eccentric peak velocity and vertical displacement during the CMJ. This enhanced eccentric phase may have resulted in a greater production and subsequent utilization of stored elastic strain energy that led to the significantly better CMJ performance in the stronger group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional movement screen (FMS) have been used to assess the movement patterns in daily sports practice. Some associations between FMS scores and physical variables have been found in some sports. Nevertheless, no study was conducted in surf. METHODS: Eighteen surf athletes (11 male) participated in the study (18.3{\textpm}6.3 years; 60.0{\textpm}9.6 kg; 168.6{\textpm}8.1 cm). All participants completed anthropometrics, knee-to-wall test, Functional Movement Screen, Isometric Knee Extension, Handgrip, Squat and Countermovement Jump. Based on that, this study investigated: 1) the variance of FMS scores between gender; 2) the association between FMS scores and physical variables of strength of upper and lower limbs, power of lower limbs and anthropometric variables; and 3) which FMS scores best explain the physical performance variables. RESULTS: The analysis of comparison between gender of each item of FMS showed significant statistical differences only in trunk stability push-up (P=0.01, ES=0.141). Kendall's Tau b correlation test between FMS scores and physical variables, revealed significant associations. After performed the stepwise multiple linear regression, FMS deep squat and trunk stability push-up explain 57\% of right side knee-to-wall test and the model is statistically significant (F(2,15)=13.097; P=0.001). In squat jump (height) the results show that FMS trunk stability push-up explains 50.3\% of this dimension and the model is statistically significant (F(1,16)=18.182; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FMS individual scores seems to better explain physical variables than total score. Only trunk stability push-up test seems to be a reliable indicator to predict physical performance in surf athletes.},

  abstract = {Surfing is a popular recreational sport that carries a substantial risk of injury. Although head injuries are frequently documented in the surfing population, an in depth assessment of the prevalence of surfing-related head injury has not been reported. A web-based survey was conducted in May of 2015. Participants were asked a series of questions regarding surfing-related injuries and demographic characteristics. A total of 50 responses were obtained, of which 35 (70\%) reported sustaining a head injury. The most common injury was laceration of the head/face (n=27), followed by concussion (n=13). Other injuries, such as skull fracture and broken nose, were also reported. Only 2 of the 50 participants reported wearing a protective helmet. Neurosurgical intervention was required in 2 instances. Increased emphasis on preventative measures by the medical community may reduce the future incidence of such injuries. Medical professionals should be aware of the most common forms of injury sustained by the surfing population in order to better recognize and treat these conditions.},
