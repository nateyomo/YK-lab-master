  abstract = {Some plant foods evolve defense mechanisms to protect themselves from predators by producing inherent chemicals as secondary metabolites such as cyanogenic glycosides, glycoalkaloids, glucosinolates, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and lectins. These metabolites are beneficial for the plant itself but toxic to other organisms, including human beings. Some of these toxic chemicals are believed to have therapeutic benefits and are therefore used to protect against chronic health complications such as cancer. Inversely, short- and long-term exposure to significant amounts of these phytotoxins may end up with chronic irreversible negative health problems in important organ systems, and in severe cases, they can be carcinogenic and fatal. A systematic literature search of relevant published articles indexed in Google Scholar{\textregistered}, PubMed{\textregistered}, Scopus{\textregistered}, Springer Link{\textregistered}, Web of Science{\textregistered}, MDPI{\textregistered}, and ScienceDirect databases was used to obtain the necessary information. Various traditional and emerging food-processing techniques have been found to considerably reduce most of the toxicants in the food to their safest level. Despite their ability to preserve the nutritional value of processed foods, emerging food processing methods have limited application and accessibility in middle- and low-income countries. As a consequence, much more work is recommended on the implementation of emerging technologies, with additional scientific work on food processing methods that are effective against these naturally occurring plant food toxicants, particularly pyrrolizidine alkaloids.},
