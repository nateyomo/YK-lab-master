  abstract = {The sensitivity and specificity of a test cannot be used to estimate probability of disease in individual patients. They can, however, be combined into a single measure called the likelihood ratio which is, clinically, more useful than sensitivity or specificity. Likelihood ratios provide a summary of how many times more (or less) likely patients with a disease are to have a particular result than patients without the disease. Using the principles of the Bayes theorem, likelihood ratios can be used in conjunction with pre-test probability of disease to estimate an individual's post-test probability of disease, that is his or her chance of having disease once the result of a test is known. The Fagan's nomogram is a graphical tool which, in routine clinical practice, allows one to combine the likelihood ratio of a test with a patient's pre-test probability of disease to estimate post-test probability. CONCLUSION: Likelihood ratios summarize information about a diagnostic test by combining sensitivity and specificity. The Fagan's nomogram is a useful and convenient graphical tool that allows likelihood ratios to be used in conjunction with a patient's pre-test probability of disease to estimate the post-test probability of disease.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity, which denotes the proportion of subjects correctly given a positive assignment out of all subjects who are actually positive for the outcome, indicates how well a test can classify subjects who truly have the outcome of interest. Specificity, which denotes the proportion of subjects correctly given a negative assignment out of all subjects who are actually negative for the outcome, indicates how well a test can classify subjects who truly do not have the outcome of interest. Positive predictive value reflects the proportion of subjects with a positive test result who truly have the outcome of interest. Negative predictive value reflects the proportion of subjects with a negative test result who truly do not have the outcome of interest. Sensitivity and specificity are inversely related, wherein one increases as the other decreases, but are generally considered stable for a given test, whereas positive and negative predictive values do inherently vary with pre-test probability (e.g., changes in population disease prevalence). This article will further detail the concepts of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values using a recent real-world example from the medical literature.},

  abstract = {The odds ratio (OR)~is a~measure of how strongly an event is associated with exposure. The odds ratio is a ratio of two sets of odds: the odds of~the event~occurring~in an exposed group versus the odds of the event~occurring~in a non-exposed group.~ Odds ratios commonly~are~used to report case-control studies. The odds ratio helps identify how likely an exposure is to lead to a specific event. The larger the odds ratio, the higher odds that the event will occur with exposure. ~Odds ratios smaller than one imply the event has fewer odds of happening with the exposure.},
