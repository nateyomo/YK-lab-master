  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The identification of central sensitization (CS) is an important aspect in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Several methods have been developed, including clinical indicators and psychophysical measures. However, whether clinical indicators coincide with the psychophysical test of CS-related sign and symptoms is still unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical indicators in identifying CS-related sign and symptoms in patients with musculoskeletal pain.                                         Methods               One-hundred consecutive patients with musculoskeletal pain were included. Clinical indicators (index method) based on a combination of patient self-report pain characteristics and physical examination were used to identify the phenotype of patients with musculoskeletal pain and the predominance of the CS-related sign and symptoms. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) was assessed by the Cold Pressor Test (reference standard), which is a psychophysical test used to detect impairment of CPM. Measurements of the diagnostic accuracy were performed.                                         Results               Twenty-seven patients presented predominance of CS-related sign and symptoms in the assessment of the clinical indicators, and 20 had impairment of CPM. Clinical indicators showed high accuracy (75.0\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,65.3 to 83.1), high specificity (80.0\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,69.6 to 88.1), high negative predictive value (87.7\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,81.2 to 92.1), and a relevant positive likelihood ratio (2.8, 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.5 to 5.0) when compared to the Cold Pressor Test.                                         Conclusion               Clinical indicators demonstrated a valuable tool for detecting the impaired CPM, which is a remarkable feature of the CS-related sign and symptoms. Clinicians are encouraged to use the clinical indicators in the management of patients with musculoskeletal pain.},

The goal of the current study was to evaluate group and treatment-related differences among adults with varying levels of ACE exposure participating in a pain rehabilitation treatment program. METHODS: Adult participants (N=269) were categorized as 0 ACEs (n=65), 1 to 2 ACEs (n=87), or {$\geq$}3 ACEs (n=117). Participants completed self-report measures of pain, physical functioning, and psychosocial functioning at intake and discharge from a 10-week interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program. RESULTS: ACE exposure was frequently endorsed in this sample, with the majority of participants (78.5\%) reporting at least 1 form of childhood adversity. Adults in the {$\geq$}3 ACEs group reported a greater level of impairment in mental health symptoms and adjustment to chronic pain; however, all groups endorsed treatment improvements and there were no differences in response to treatment. There were also no differences between groups on measures of pain or physical functioning at intake or discharge. DISCUSSION: ACE exposure appears common among treatment-seeking adults with chronic pain and is associated with increased clinical complexity. However, adults with and without exposure to ACEs endorsed significant improvements in pain and functioning following participation in an interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program. This model of treatment may be especially well situated to address the biopsychosocial contributions to pain among those with a history of adversity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This explorative study analyses interrelationships between peripheral compounds in saliva, plasma, and muscles together with body composition variables in healthy subjects and in fibromyalgia patients (FM). There is a need to better understand the extent cytokines and chemokines are associated with body composition and which cytokines and chemokines differentiate FM from healthy controls. METHODS: Here, 32 female FM patients and 30 age-matched female healthy controls underwent a clinical examination that included blood sample, saliva samples, and pain threshold tests. In addition, the subjects completed a health questionnaire. From these blood and saliva samples, a panel of 68 mainly cytokines and chemokines were determined. Microdialysis of trapezius and erector spinae muscles, phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy of erector spinae muscle, and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging for determination of body composition (BC)-i.e., muscle volume, fat content and infiltration-were also performed. RESULTS: After standardizing BC measurements to remove the confounding effect of Body Mass Index, fat infiltration and content are generally increased, and fat-free muscle volume is decreased in FM. Mainly saliva proteins differentiated FM from controls. When including all investigated compounds and BC variables, fat infiltration and content variables were most important, followed by muscle compounds and cytokines and chemokines from saliva and plasma. Various plasma proteins correlated positively with pain intensity in FM and negatively with pain thresholds in all subjects taken together. A mix of increased plasma cytokines and chemokines correlated with an index covering fat infiltration and content in different tissues. When muscle compounds were included in the analysis, several of these were identified as the most important regressors, although many plasma and saliva proteins remained significant. DISCUSSION: Peripheral factors were important for group differentiation between FM and controls. In saliva (but not plasma), cytokines and chemokines were significantly associated with group membership as saliva compounds were increased in FM. The importance of peripheral factors for group differentiation increased when muscle compounds and body composition variables were also included. Plasma proteins were important for pain intensity and sensitivity. Cytokines and chemokines mainly from plasma were also significantly and positively associated with a fat infiltration and content index. CONCLUSION: Our findings of associations between cytokines and chemokines and fat infiltration and content in different tissues confirm that inflammation and immune factors are secreted from adipose tissue. FM is clearly characterized by complex interactions between peripheral tissues and the peripheral and central nervous systems, including nociceptive, immune, and neuroendocrine processes.},

This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with persistent pain after total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) surgeries. To meet the inclusion criteria, studies were required to assess variables before or at the time of surgery, include a persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) outcome measure at least 2 months after a TKR or THR surgery, and include a statistical analysis of the effect of the risk factor(s) on the outcome measure. Outcomes from studies implementing univariate and multivariable statistical models were analyzed separately. Where possible, data from univariate analyses on the same factors were combined in a meta-analysis. Eighty-one studies involving 171,354 patients were included in the review. Because of the heterogeneity of assessment methods, only 44\% of the studies allowed meaningful meta-analysis. In meta-analyses, state anxiety (but not trait anxiety) scores and higher depression scores on the Beck Depression Inventory were associated with an increased risk of PPSP after TKR. In the qualitative summary of multivariable analyses, higher preoperative pain scores were associated with PPSP after TKR or THR. This review systematically assessed factors associated with an increased risk of PPSP after TKR and THR and highlights current knowledge gaps that can be addressed by future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Chronic pain is maintained in part by central sensitization, a phenomenon of synaptic plasticity, and increased neuronal responsiveness in central pain pathways after painful insults. Accumulating evidence suggests that central sensitization is also driven by neuroinflammation in the peripheral and central nervous system. A characteristic feature of neuroinflammation is the activation of glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, in the spinal cord and brain, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Recent studies suggest that central cytokines and chemokines are powerful neuromodulators and play a sufficient role in inducing hyperalgesia and allodynia after central nervous system administration. Sustained increase of cytokines and chemokines in the central nervous system also promotes chronic widespread pain that affects multiple body sites. Thus, neuroinflammation drives widespread chronic pain via central sensitization. We also discuss sex-dependent glial/immune signaling in chronic pain and new therapeutic approaches that control neuroinflammation for the resolution of chronic pain.},

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. Searches were performed on Pubmed, PEDro, and CINAHL, and only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients {$\geq$}18 years of age with chronic MSK pain due to CS were included. No meta-analysis was conducted, and qualitative analysis was realized. RESULTS: 15 RCTs were included. Findings were divided for diagnostic criteria (fibromyalgia-FM, chronic fatigue syndrome-CFS, low back pain-LBP, chronic spinal pain-CSP). PNE has been proposed as a single intervention or associated with other approaches, and different measures were used for the main outcomes considered. Conclusions, practice implication: PNE is effective in improving pain, disability, and psychosocial factors in patients with fibromyalgia, chronic low back pain (CLBP)-especially if associated with other therapeutic approaches-and also in patients with CFS and CSP. Overall, PNE seems to be more effective when proposed in one-to-one oral sessions and associated with reinforcement elements. However, specific eligibility criteria for chronic MSK pain due to CS are still lacking in most RCTs; therefore, for future research, it is mandatory to specify such criteria in primary studies.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) is a non-invasive and inexpensive therapy used to treat Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) by sequentially activating motor networks in such a way that movement and pain are unpaired. The objective of this systematic review was to critically appraise relevant data on the efficacy of GMI and its components for reducing PLP and disability in amputees. METHODS: We searched 11 electronic databases for controlled trials investigating GMI and its components in amputees with PLP from inception until February 2023. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted relevant data. Study-level data were entered using the inverse variance function of the Review Manager 5 and pooled with the random effects model. RESULTS: Eleven studies with varying risk of bias were eligible. No eligible study considered left/right judgement tasks in isolation. Studies showed no effect for imagined movements, but positive effects were seen for GMI [weighted mean difference: -21.29 (95\%CI: -31.55, -11.02), I2= 0\%] and mirror therapy [weighted mean difference: -8.55 (95\%CI: -14.74, -2.35, I2= 61\%]. A comparison of mirror therapy versus sham showed no difference [weighted mean difference: -4.43 (95\%CI: -16.03, 7.16), I2= 51\%]. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that GMI and mirror therapy may be effective for reducing PLP. However, this conclusion was drawn from a limited body of evidence, and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Therefore, rigorous, high-quality trials are needed to address the gap in the literature and inform practice.},

  abstract = {Exercise is considered an important component of effective chronic pain management and it is well-established that long-term exercise training provides pain relief. In healthy, pain-free populations, a single bout of aerobic or resistance exercise typically leads to exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH), a generalized reduction in pain and pain sensitivity that occurs during exercise and for some time afterward. In contrast, EIH is more variable in chronic pain populations and is more frequently impaired; with pain and pain sensitivity decreasing, remaining unchanged or, in some cases, even increasing in response to exercise. Pain exacerbation with exercise may be a major barrier to adherence, precipitating a cycle of physical inactivity that can lead to long-term worsening of both pain and disability. To optimize the therapeutic benefits of exercise, it is important to understand how EIH works, why it may be impaired in some people with chronic pain, and how this should be addressed in clinical practice. In this article, we provide an overview of EIH across different chronic pain conditions. We discuss possible biological mechanisms of EIH and the potential influence of sex and psychosocial factors, both in pain-free adults and, where possible, in individuals with chronic pain. The clinical implications of impaired EIH are discussed and recommendations are made for future research, including further exploration of individual differences in EIH, the relationship between exercise dose and EIH, the efficacy of combined treatments and the use of alternative measures to quantify EIH. PERSPECTIVE: This article provides a contemporary review of the acute effects of exercise on pain and pain sensitivity, including in people with chronic pain conditions. Existing findings are critically reviewed, clinical implications are discussed, and recommendations are offered for future research.},

  abstract = {Exercise and pain neuroscience education (PNE) have both been used as standalone treatments for chronic musculoskeletal pain. The evidence supporting PNE as an adjunct to exercise therapy is growing but remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of combining PNE and exercise for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, when compared with exercise alone. A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted from inception to November 6, 2020. A quality effects model was used to meta-analyze outcomes where possible. Five high-quality randomized controlled studies (n = 460) were included in this review. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of individual studies, and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation analysis was conducted to determine the quality of evidence for each outcome. Meta-analyses were performed for pain intensity, disability, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophizing using data reported between 0 and 12 weeks postintervention. Long-term outcomes ({$>$}12 weeks) were only available for 2 studies and therefore were not suitable for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed a significant difference in pain (weighted mean differences, -2.09/10; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -3.38 to -0.80; low certainty), disability (standardized mean difference, -0.68; 95\% CI, -1.17 to -0.20; low certainty), kinesiophobia (standardized mean difference, -1.20; CI, -1.84 to -0.57; moderate certainty), and pain catastrophizing (weighted mean differences, -7.72; 95\% CI, -12.26 to -3.18; very low certainty) that favoured the combination of PNE and exercise. These findings suggest that combining PNE and exercise in the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain results in greater short-term improvements in pain, disability, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophizing relative to exercise alone.},

With regard to neurophysiology, a decrease in intracortical inhibition for the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the affected hand has been repetitively verified, which might be related to increased primary somatosensory cortex functional activation for the affected limb. Rare longitudinal intervention studies in randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that a decrease in primary somatosensory cortex functional MRI activation coincided with pain relief and recovery in sensorimotor performance. By applying a randomized wait-list control crossover study design, we tested possible associations of clinical, imaging and neurophysiology parameters in 21 patients with complex regional pain syndrome in the chronic stage ({$>$}6 months). In more detail, we applied graded motor imagery over 6 weeks to relieve movement pain of the affected upper limb. First, baseline parameters were tested between the affected and the non-affected upper limb side and age-matched healthy controls. Second, longitudinal changes in clinical and testing parameters were associated with neurophysiological and imaging parameters. During baseline short intracortical inhibition, as assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation, was decreased only for hand muscles of the affected hand side. During movement of the affected limb, primary somatosensory cortex functional MRI activation was increased. Hand representation area size for somatosensory stimulation in functional MRI was smaller on the affected side with longer disease duration. Graded motor imagery intervention but not waiting, resulted in a decrease of movement pain. An increase of somatosensory hand representation size over graded motor imagery intervention was related to movement pain relief. Over graded motor imagery intervention, pathological parameters like the increased primary somatosensory cortex activation during fist movement or decreased short intracortical inhibition were modified in the same way as movement pain and hand performance improved. No such changes were observed during the waiting period. Overall, we demonstrated characteristic changes in clinical, behaviour and neuropathology parameters applying graded motor imagery in patients with upper limb complex regional pain syndrome, which casts light on the effects of graded motor imagery intervention on biomarkers for chronic neuropathic pain.},

  abstract = {Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is an urgent global public health concern. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) is an intervention used in the management of CMP aiming to reconceptualize an individual's understanding of their pain as less threatening. This mixed-methods review undertook a segregated synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies to investigate the clinical effectiveness, and patients' experience of, PNE for people with CMP. Electronic databases were searched for studies published between January 1, 2002, and June 14, 2018. Twelve randomized, controlled trials (n\,=\,755 participants) that reported pain, disability, and psychosocial outcomes and 4 qualitative studies (n\,=\,50 participants) that explored patients experience of PNE were included. The meta-analyzed pooled treatment effects for PNE versus control had low clinical relevance in the short term for pain (-5.91/100; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -13.75 to 1.93) and disability (-4.09/100; 95\% CI, -7.72 to -.45) and in the medium term for pain (-6.27/100; 95\% CI, -18.97 to 6.44) and disability (-8.14/100; 95\% CI, -15.60 to -.68). The treatment effect of PNE for kinesiophobia was clinically relevant in the short term (-13.55/100; 95\% CI, -25.89 to -1.21) and for pain catastrophizing in the medium term (-5.26/52; 95\% CI, -10.59 to .08). A metasynthesis of 23 qualitative findings resulted in the identification of 2 synthesized findings that identified several key components important for enhancing the patient experience of PNE, such as allowing the patient to tell their own story. These components can enhance pain reconceptualization, which seems to be an important process to facilitate patients' ability to cope with their condition. The protocol was published on PROSPERO (CRD42017068436). Perspective: We outline the effectiveness of PNE for the management of pain, disability, and psychosocial outcomes in adults with CMP. Key components that can enhance the patient experience of PNE, such as allowing the patient to tell their own story, are also presented. These components may enhance pain reconceptualization.},
