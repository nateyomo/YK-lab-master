  abstract = {Various lines of evidence suggest that the striatum is implicated in cognitive flexibility. The neuropsychological evidence has, for the most part, been based on research with patients with Parkinson's disease, which is accompanied by chemical disruption of both the striatum and the prefrontal cortex. The present study examined this issue by testing patients with focal lesions of the striatum on a task measuring two forms of cognitive switching. Patients with striatal, but not frontal lobe lesions, were impaired in switching between concrete sensory stimuli. By contrast, both patient groups were unimpaired when switching between abstract task rules relative to baseline nonswitch trials. These results reveal a dissociation between two distinct forms of cognitive flexibility, providing converging evidence for a role of the striatum in flexible control functions associated with the selection of behaviorally relevant stimuli.},

  abstract = {The hypoglossal nerve is the 12th cranial nerve, exiting the brainstem in the preolivary sulcus, passing through the premedullary cistern, and exiting the skull through the hypoglossal canal. This is a purely motor nerve, responsible for the innervation of all the intrinsic tongue muscles (superior longitudinal muscle, inferior longitudinal muscle, transverse muscle, and vertical muscle), 3 extrinsic tongue muscles (styloglossus, hyoglossus, and genioglossus), and the geniohyoid muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging exam to evaluate patients with clinical signs of hypoglossal nerve palsy, and computed tomography may have a complementary role in the evaluation of bone lesions affecting the hypoglossal canal. A heavily T2-weighted sequence, such as fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) or constructive interference steady state (CISS) is important to evaluate this nerve on MRI. There are multiple causes of hypoglossal nerve palsy, being neoplasia the most common cause, but vascular lesions, inflammatory diseases, infections, and trauma can also affect this nerve. The purpose of this article is to review the hypoglossal nerve anatomy, discuss the best imaging techniques to evaluate this nerve and demonstrate the imaging aspect of the main diseases that affect it.},

  abstract = {Orofacial pain in patients relies on the anatomical pathways that conduct nociceptive information, originating from the periphery towards the trigeminal sensory nucleus complex (TSNC) and finally, to the thalami and the somatosensorical cortical regions. The anatomy and function of the so-called trigeminothalamic tracts have been investigated before. In these animal-based studies from the previous century, the intracerebral pathways were mapped using different retro- and anterograde tracing methods. We review the literature on the trigeminothalamic tracts focusing on these animal tracer studies. Subsequently, we related the observations of these studies to clinical findings using fMRI trials. The intracerebral trigeminal pathways can be subdivided into three pathways: a ventral (contralateral) and dorsal (mainly ipsilateral) trigeminothalamic tract and the intranuclear pathway. Based on the reviewed evidence we hypothesize the co-existence of an ipsilateral nociceptive conduction tract to the cerebral cortex and we translate evidence from animal-based research to the human anatomy. Our hypothesis differs from the classical idea that orofacial pain arises only from nociceptive information via the contralateral, ventral trigeminothalamic pathway. Better understanding of the histology, anatomy and connectivity of the trigeminal fibers could contribute to the discovery of a more effective pain treatment in patients suffering from various orofacial pain syndromes.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to review surgical anatomy of the trigeminal nerve. We also demonstrate some pictures involving the trigeminal nerve and its surrounding connective and neurovascular structures. Ten adult cadaveric heads were studied, using a magnification ranging from 3{\texttimes} to 40{\texttimes}, after perfusion of the arteries and veins with colored latex. The trigeminal nerve is the largest and most complex of the cranial nerves. It serves as a major conduit of sensory input from the face and provides motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. Because of its size and complexity, it is essential to have thorough knowledge of the nerve before diagnoses and treatment of the pathologic processes in the orofacial, temporomandibular, infratemporal, and pterygopalatine areas. The trigeminal nerve is encountered with imaging or surgery of the skull base surgery. Thus, a comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve is crucial for performing the surgical procedures without significant complication. Clin.

Sensory information is recognized as an electrical signal and is transmitted via various tracts throughout the nervous system. Proprioception is the ability to sense position and perform movements of different parts of the body. Proprioceptors, a type of mechanoreceptor, are responsible for recognizing proprioceptive signals. Golgi muscle tendons and muscle spindles are two main types of proprioceptors that detect muscle strain and muscle contraction, respectively.},

  abstract = {The role of the trigeminal system in facial and dural sensitivity has been recognized for a long time. More recently, the trigeminal system has also been considered a prominent actor in brain nociceptive innervation. It is the anatomical substrate of several frequent conditions, such as primary or secondary headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, and other orofacial pains. Appreciation of the delicate anatomical arrangement of the trigeminal pathway is one of the keys to understanding these conditions' pathophysiology and to proposing innovative treatments. This review provides a structured presentation of existing knowledge about the trigeminal system, from classical anatomical data to the most recent literature. First, we present the organization of the trigeminal pathway from the trigeminal divisions, nerve, and nuclei to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex. We describe the neurons and fibers' repartition at each level, depending on the location (somatotopic organization) and the type of receptors (modal organization). Such a dual somatotopic-modal arrangement of the trigeminal fibers is especially clear for the juxtapontine segment of the trigeminal nerve and the trigeminal nuclei of the brainstem. It has significant clinical consequences both for diagnosis and treatment. Second, we explore how the trigeminal system is modulated and involved in reflexes, for instance the trigemino-cardiac and the trigemino-autonomic reflexes, which could play an essential role in the autonomic symptoms observed in cluster headache. Finally, we present how to interact with this complex system to relieve pain mediated by the trigeminal system. This section covers both neuromodulatory and lesional approaches.},
