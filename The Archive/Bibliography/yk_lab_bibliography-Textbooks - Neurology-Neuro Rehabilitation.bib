This text uniquely brings the fields of neuroscience and neurologic physical therapy practice together in a single volume that explores neurologic pathologies and their management across the lifespan. This field is crucial to our understanding of neurologic function, the effects of neurologic damage, and the plasticity of the nervous system as it responds to growth, development, aging, damage, and activity. These eleven chapters delineate common neurologic disease and injury processes, the current medical management, and the targeted physical therapy evaluation and treatment for each, examining the emerging evidence of how physical therapy can influence neuroplasticity. Each chapter is anchored by clinical cases, following a patient through the diagnostic process, physical therapy assessment, and potential treatment options across stages of the condition"--},
