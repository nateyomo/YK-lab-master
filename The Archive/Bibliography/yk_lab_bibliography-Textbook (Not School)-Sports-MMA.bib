  abstract = {Principles of Power explains the physics behind the hardest hitting fighters in history, then demonstrates practical ways to incorporate these principles into your own striking arsenal in an easy to understand, no nonsense way. For years sports scientists have studied how to put the most power into movement patterns from popular sports; from a pitcher throwing a baseball to a golfer swinging his golf club. This same attention has rarely been given to combat sports or martial arts, in part because a fighter must balance mobility and defense along with power generation. But the lack of research has not stopped generations of talented fighters of all disciplines from finding ways to incorporate massive power building techniques into their own unique styles. This book not only explains the physics behind massive power generation, it also gives hundreds of examples of how to use them. Each physics principle is followed with a Practical Applications section. This section demonstrates several proven set ups and techniques used by the world's greatest fighters, from simple, staple techniques to complex, advanced methods. In this way, the reader can incorporate the principles in a way that works best for their own unique style.},
