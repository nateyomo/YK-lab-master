  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative anaemia is a frequent surgical complication and in contrast to preoperative anaemia has not been validated in relation to mortality, morbidity and its associated health economic effect. Postoperative anaemia can predispose postoperative delirium through impairment of cerebral oxygenation. The aim of this secondary analysis is to investigate the association of postoperative anaemia in accordance with the sex specific World Health Organization definition of anaemia to postoperative delirium and its impact on the duration of hospital stay. METHODS: A secondary analysis of the prospective multicentric observational CESARO-study was conducted. 800 adult patients undergoing elective surgery were enrolled from various operative disciplines across seven hospitals ranging from university hospitals, district general hospitals to specialist clinics of minimally invasive surgery in Germany. Patients were classified as anaemic according to the World Health Organization parameters, setting the haemoglobin level cut off below 12g/dl for females and below 13g/dl for males. Focus of the investigation were patients with acute anaemia. Patients with present preoperative anaemia or missing haemoglobin measurement were excluded from the sample set. Delirium screening was established postoperatively for at least 24{$\mkern1mu$}hours and up to three days, applying the validated Nursing Delirium Screening Scale. RESULTS: The initial sample set contained 800 patients of which 183 were suitable for analysis in the study. Ninety out of 183 (49.2\%) suffered from postoperative anaemia. Ten out of 93 (10.9\%) patients without postoperative anaemia developed a postoperative delirium. In the group with postoperative anaemia, 28 (38.4\%) out of 90 patients suffered from postoperative delirium (odds ratio 3.949, 95\% confidence interval, (1.358-11.480)) after adjustment for NYHA-stadium, severity of surgery, cutting/suture time, duration of anaesthesia, transfusion of packed red cells and sedation status with Richmond Agitation Scale after surgery. Additionally, patients who suffered from postoperative anaemia showed a significantly longer duration of hospitalisation (7.75 vs. 12.42 days, odds ratio = 1.186, 95\% confidence interval, 1.083-1.299, after adjustments). CONCLUSION: The study results reveal that postoperative anaemia is not only a frequent postsurgical complication with an incidence probability of almost 50\%, but could also be associated with a postoperative delirium and a prolonged hospitalisation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient blood management (PBM) can prevent preoperative anaemia, but little is known about practice in Europe. OBJECTIVE: To assess the pre and postoperative prevalence and perioperative management of anaemia in patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery in Europe. DESIGN: An observational study; data were collected from patient records via electronic case report forms. SETTING: Seventeen centres in six European countries. Centres were stratified according to whether they had a PBM programme or not. PATIENTS: One thousand five hundred and thirty-four patients undergoing major elective hip, knee or spine surgery [49.9\% hip, 37.2\% knee, 13.0\% spine; age 64.0 years (range 18 to 80), 61.3\% female]. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of preoperative (primary endpoint) and postoperative anaemia [haemoglobin (Hb) {$<$}13{$\mkern1mu$}g{$\mkern1mu$}dl (male), Hb {$<$}12{$\mkern1mu$}g{$\mkern1mu$}dl (female)], perioperative anaemia management, time to first blood transfusion and number of transfused units. Data are shown as mean (SD) or median (interquartile range). RESULTS: Anaemia prevalence increased from 14.1\% preoperatively to 85.8\% postoperatively. Mean Hb decrease was 1.9 (1.5) and 3.0 (1.3){$\mkern1mu$}g{$\mkern1mu$}dl in preoperatively anaemic and nonanaemic patients, respectively (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001). In PBM (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}7) vs. non-PBM centres, preoperative anaemia was less frequent (8.0 vs. 18.5\%; P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001) and iron status was assessed more frequently (ferritin 11.0 vs. 2.6\%, transferrin saturation 11.0 vs. 0.1\%; P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001). Perioperative anaemia correction (mainly transfusion) was given to 34.3\%. Intraoperatively, 14.8\% of preoperatively anaemic and 2.8\% of nonanaemic patients received transfusions [units per patient: 2.4 (1.5) and 2.2 (1.4), median time to first intraoperative transfusion: 130 (88, 158) vs. 179 (135, 256){$\mkern1mu$}min; P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001]. Postoperative complications were more frequent in preoperatively anaemic vs. nonanaemic patients (36.9 vs. 22.2\%; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.009). CONCLUSION: Most patients who underwent elective orthopaedic surgery had normal preoperative Hb levels but became anaemic after the procedure. Those who were anaemic prior to surgery had an increased intraoperative transfusion risk and postoperative complication rate. PBM measures such as iron status assessment and strategies to avoid transfusion are still underused in Europe.},
