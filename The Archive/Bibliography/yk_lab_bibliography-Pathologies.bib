  abstract = {Caffeine is a commonly used neurostimulant that also produces cerebral vasoconstriction by antagonizing adenosine receptors. Chronic caffeine use results in an adaptation of the vascular adenosine receptor system presumably to compensate for the vasoconstrictive effects of caffeine. We investigated the effects of caffeine on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in increasing levels of chronic caffeine use. Low (mean = 45 mg/day), moderate (mean = 405 mg/day), and high (mean = 950 mg/day) caffeine users underwent quantitative perfusion magnetic resonance imaging on four separate occasions: twice in a caffeine abstinent state (abstained state) and twice in a caffeinated state following their normal caffeine use (native state). In each state, there were two drug conditions: participants received either caffeine (250 mg) or placebo. Gray matter CBF was tested with repeated-measures analysis of variance using caffeine use as a between-subjects factor, and correlational analyses were conducted between CBF and caffeine use. Caffeine reduced CBF by an average of 27\% across both caffeine states. In the abstained placebo condition, moderate and high users had similarly greater CBF than low users; but in the native placebo condition, the high users had a trend towards less CBF than the low and moderate users. Our results suggest a limited ability of the cerebrovascular adenosine system to compensate for high amounts of daily caffeine use.},

Mechanical factors are the most common etiology of heel pain. Common causes of hell pain includes: Plantar Fasciitis, Heel Spur, Sever's Disease, Heel bump, Achilles Tendinopathy, Heel neuritis, Heel bursitis. The diagnosis is mostly based on clinical examination. Normally, the location of the pain and the absence of associated symptoms indicating a systemic disease strongly suggest the diagnosis. Several therapies exist including rest, physical therapy, stretching, and change in footwear, arch supports, orthotics, night splints, anti-inflammatory agents, and surgery. Almost all patients respond to conservative nonsurgical therapy. Surgery is the last treatment option if all other treatments had failed. Rest, ice, massage, the use of correct exercise and complying with a doctor's advice all play important part in helping to recover from this hell pain condition, but getting good quality, suitable shoes with the appropriate amount of support for the whole foot is the most important.},

The repetitive nature of swimming can predispose the shoulder to mechanical impingement and microtrauma, which may lead to laxity, rotator cuff fatigue, and subsequent secondary impingement. Improper stroke mechanics can place the swimmer's shoulder at further risk. The purpose of this paper is to describe the pathology of secondary impingement in freestyle swimmers and to discuss the clinical implications for rehabilitation of swimmers with the pathology. A thorough subjective and objective evaluation is necessary to design a successful rehabilitation program. The rehabilitation program for swimmers with secondary impingement includes modification of training, flexibility, range of motion, strengthening, and mobilization as indicated. Functional and proprioceptive training may also be useful techniques in the rehabilitation of swimmer's shoulder. Improper stroke mechanics can also have clinical implications on swimmer's shoulders with secondary impingement. The clinical implication of secondary impingement in freestyle swimmers suggests that the primary goal of rehabilitation is to promote equilibrium of the shoulder complex while accounting for the demands of the sport.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inspiratory muscle training (IMT)~aims to improve respiratory muscle strength and endurance.~Clinical trials used various training protocols,~devices and respiratory measurements to check the effectiveness of this intervention. The current guidelines reported a possible advantage of IMT, particularly in people with respiratory muscle weakness. However, it remains unclear to what extent IMT~is clinically beneficial, especially when associated with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). ~ OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as a stand-alone intervention and when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) EBSCO, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 20 October 2021.~We also checked reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IMT in combination with PR versus PR alone and IMT versus control/sham.~We included different types of IMT irrespective of the mode of delivery.~We~excluded~trials that used~resistive devices without controlling the breathing pattern or a training load of less than 30\% of maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), or both. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods recommended by Cochrane including assessment of risk of bias with RoB 2. Our primary outcomes were dyspnea, functional exercise capacity and health-related quality of life.~ MAIN RESULTS: We included 55 RCTs in this review. Both IMT and PR protocols varied significantly across the trials, especially in training duration, loads, devices, number/ frequency of sessions and the PR programs. Only eight trials were at low risk of bias. PR+IMT versus PR We included 22 trials (1446 participants) in this comparison. Based on a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of -1 unit, we did not find an improvement in dyspnea assessed with the~Borg scale~at submaximal exercise capacity (mean difference (MD) 0.19, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.42 to 0.79; 2 RCTs, 202 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). ~ We also found no improvement in dyspnea assessed with themodified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRC) according to an MCID between -0.5 and -1 unit (MD -0.12, 95\% CI -0.39 to 0.14; 2 RCTs, 204 participants; very low-certainty evidence).~ Pooling evidence for the~6-minute walk distance (6MWD)~showed~an increase of 5.95 meters~(95\% CI -5.73~to 17.63; 12 RCTs, 1199 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and failed to reach the~MCID of 26 meters. In subgroup analysis, we divided the RCTs according to the training duration and mean baseline PImax. The test for subgroup differences was not significant. Trials at low risk of bias (n = 3) demonstrated a larger effect estimate than the overall. The summary effect of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) revealed an overall~total score below the MCID of 4 units (MD 0.13, 95\% CI -0.93 to 1.20; 7 RCTs, 908 participants; low-certainty evidence).~ The summary effect of COPD Assessment Test (CAT) did not show an improvement in the HRQoL (MD 0.13, 95\% CI -0.80 to 1.06; 2 RCTs, 657 participants; very low-certainty evidence), according to an MCID of -1.6 units.~ Pooling the RCTs that reported PImax showed an increase of 11.46 cmH2O (95\% CI 7.42 to 15.50; 17 RCTs, 1329 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) but failed to reach the MCID of 17.2 cmH2O. ~In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness.~ One abstract reported some adverse effects that were considered "minor and self-limited". IMT versus control/sham Thirty-seven~RCTs with 1021 participants contributed to our second comparison. There was a trend towards an improvement when Borg was calculated~at submaximal exercise capacity~(MD -0.94, 95\% CI -1.36 to -0.51; 6 RCTs, 144 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Only one trial was at a low risk of bias. Eight studies (nine arms) used the Baseline Dyspnea Index - Transition Dyspnea Index (BDI-TDI).~Based on an MCID of +1 unit, they~showed an improvement only with the 'total score' of the TDI (MD 2.98, 95\% CI 2.07 to 3.89; 8 RCTs, 238 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We~did not find a difference between studies classified as with and without respiratory muscle weakness. Only one trial was at low risk of bias. Four studies reported the mMRC, revealing a possible~improvement in dyspnea~in the IMT group~(MD -0.59, 95\% CI -0.76 to -0.43; 4 RCTs, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two trials were at low risk of bias. Compared to control/sham, the MD in the 6MWD following IMT was 35.71 (95\% CI 25.68~to 45.74; 16 RCTs, 501 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Two studies were at low risk of bias. In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness.~ Six studies reported theSGRQ total score, showing a larger effect in the IMT~group~(MD -3.85, 95\% CI -8.18 to 0.48; 6 RCTs, 182 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The lower limit of the 95\% CI exceeded the MCID of -4 units. Only one study was at low risk of bias. There was an improvement in life quality with CAT (MD -2.97, 95\% CI -3.85 to -2.10; 2 RCTs, 86 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial was at low risk of bias. Thirty-two RCTs reported PImax, showing an improvement without reaching the MCID (MD 14.57 cmH2O, 95\% CI 9.85 to 19.29; 32 RCTs, 916 participants; low-certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness. ~ None of the included RCTs reported adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: IMT may not~improve dyspnea, functional exercise capacity and life quality when associated with PR. However, IMT is likely to improve these outcomes when provided alone. For both interventions, a larger effect in participants with respiratory muscle weakness and with longer training durations is still to be confirmed.},

  abstract = {Delayed-onset muscular soreness (DOMS), the sensation of pain and stiffness in the muscles that occurs from 1 to 5 d following unaccustomed exercise, can adversely affect muscular performance, both from voluntary reduction of effort and from inherent loss of capacity of the muscles to produce force. This reduction in performance is temporary; permanent impairment does not occur. A number of clinical correlates are associated with DOMS, including elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure; exertional rhabdomyolysis appears to be the extreme form of DOMS. Presently, the best treatment for DOMS appears to be muscular activity, although the sensation again returns following the exercise. Training for the specific contractile activity that causes DOMS reduces the soreness response. The etiology and cellular mechanisms of DOMS are not known, but a number of hypotheses exist to explain the phenomenon. The following model may be proposed: 1) high tensions (particularly those associated with eccentric exercise) in the contractile/elastic system of the muscle result in structural damage; 2) cell membrane damage leads to disruption of Ca++ homeostasis in the injured fibers, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 2 d post-exercise; and 3) products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents accumulate in the interstitium, which in turn stimulate free nerve endings of group-IV sensory neurons in the muscles leading to the sensation of DOMS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and summarise the evidence for the effects of neuromuscular training compared with any other therapy (conventional training/sham) on knee proprioception following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. DESIGN: Systematic Review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, AMED, Scopus and Physical Education Index were searched from inception to February 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials investigating the effects of neuromuscular training on knee-specific proprioception tests following a unilateral ACL injury were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the eligible studies using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. Overall certainty in evidence was determined using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. RESULTS: Of 2706 articles retrieved, only 9 RCTs, comprising 327 individuals with an ACL reconstruction (ACLR), met the inclusion criteria. Neuromuscular training interventions varied across studies: whole body vibration therapy, Nintendo-Wii-Fit training, balance training, sport-specific exercises, backward walking, etc. Outcome measures included joint position sense (JPS; n=7), thresholds to detect passive motion (TTDPM; n=3) or quadriceps force control (QFC; n=1). Overall, between-group mean differences indicated inconsistent findings with an increase or decrease of errors associated with JPS by {$\leq$}2{$^\circ$}, TTDPM by {$\leq$}1.5{$^\circ$} and QFC by {$\leq$}6\,Nm in the ACLR knee following neuromuscular training. Owing to serious concerns with three or more GRADE domains (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness or imprecision associated with the findings) for each outcome of interest across studies, the certainty of evidence was very low. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of interventions, methodological limitations, inconsistency of effects (on JPS/TTDPM/QFC) preclude recommendation of one optimal neuromuscular training intervention for improving proprioception following ACL injury in clinical practice. There is a need for methodologically robust RCTs with homogenous populations with ACL injury (managed conservatively or with reconstruction), novel/well-designed neuromuscular training and valid proprioception assessments, which also seem to be lacking.

Although much is known about the tissue, research has had little success in elucidating the pathogenesis of generalised osteoarthritis. A new hypothesis is required. Substantial changes in many tissues, including bone, muscle, ligaments, and joint capsule, as well as cartilage, are increasingly recognised in this disease, and not all these changes are localised to the affected joints. There is also a well established link with obesity. These observations, the common origins of the mesenchymal cells that maintain these tissues, and the possible role of neuroendocrine factors that can regulate bone mass, result in the hypothesis that systemic factors that include altered lipid metabolism could explain the diversity of physiological changes in generalised osteoarthritis. If proven, this hypothesis could have important implications for a new approach to pharmacological intervention in the early stages of the disease.},

BACKGROUND: Recent literature has suggested that acetabular labral pathology secondary to femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) may be a precursor to early-onset hip osteoarthritis. The purpose of this resident's case problem was to explore the extent to which abnormal movement at the hip is a possible contributor to acetabular labral pathology. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was a 25-year-old female with a 4-year history of anterior-medial groin pain. Based on a combination of the clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging findings, she was given a diagnosis of acetabular labral tear by her orthopaedic surgeon and referred to a physical therapist for assessment. Movement analysis during a single-leg step down, running, and a drop jump maneuver revealed excessive hip adduction and internal rotation on the involved side, which reproduced her symptoms. Application of a hip-strapping device resulted in decreased hip adduction and internal rotation, and an immediate decrease in symptoms. DISCUSSION: The reduction in pain secondary to controlling hip motion suggests that excessive frontal and transverse plane hip motions may contribute to FAI. Accordingly, physical therapy intervention aimed at controlling and reducing hip adduction and internal rotation during activities may be indicated in patients who present with this movement pattern associated with anterior hip/groin pain.},

  abstract = {Rotator cuff (RC) disease is an extremely common condition associated with shoulder pain, reduced functional capacities, and impaired quality of life. It primarily involves alterations in tendon health and mechanical properties that can ultimately lead to tendon failure. RC tendon tears induce progressive muscle changes that have a negative impact on surgical reparability of the RC tendons and clinical outcomes. At the same time, a significant base of clinical data suggests a relatively weak relationship between RC integrity and clinical presentation, emphasizing the multifactorial aspects of RC disease. This review aims to summarize the potential contribution of peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal neural factors that may (1) exacerbate structural and functional muscle changes induced by tendon tear, (2) compromise the reversal of these changes during surgery and rehabilitation, (3) contribute to pain generation and persistence of pain, (4) impair shoulder function through reduced proprioception, kinematics, and muscle recruitment, and (5) help explain interindividual differences and response to treatment. Given the current clinical and scientific interest in peripheral nerve injury in the context of RC disease and surgery, we carefully reviewed this body of literature with a particular emphasis on suprascapular neuropathy that has generated a large number of studies in the past decade. Within this process, we highlight the gaps in current knowledge and suggest research avenues for scientists and clinicians.},

Due to significant phenotypic overlap, differentiating ON and CGH from primary headache disorders such as migraine or tension-type headache, or other secondary headache disorders, can be clinically challenging. This article reviews the anatomy, clinical features, unique diagnostic considerations, and management approaches relating to ON and CGH. RECENT FINDINGS: Conservative therapeutic approaches are considered first-line. Anesthetic nerve blocks may have a dual role in both supporting diagnosis and providing pain relief. Newer minimally invasive procedures, such as pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) and occipital nerve stimulation (ONS), represent an exciting therapeutic avenue for severe/refractory cases. Surgical interventions should be reserved for select patient populations who have failed all other conservative and minimally invasive options, to be weighed against potential risk. ON and CGH represent an ongoing diagnostic challenge. Further studies are required to consolidate efficacy regarding the comprehensive management of ON and CGH.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is limited research supporting optimal respiratory physiotherapy or physical rehabilitation strategies for patients with rib fractures. The aim of this study was to develop key recommendations for the physiotherapy management of patients with rib fractures. METHODS: A three-round modified e-Delphi survey design, using an international Delphi panel including physiotherapy clinicians, researchers and lecturers, physician associates, trauma surgeons, and intensivists, was used in this study. The draft recommendations were developed by the Steering Group, based on available research. Over three rounds, panelists rated their agreement (using a Likert scale) with regard to recommendation for physiotherapists delivering respiratory physiotherapy and physical rehabilitation to patients following rib fractures. Recommendations were retained if they achieved consensus (defined as {$\geq$}70\% of panelists {$\geq$}5/7) at the end of each round. RESULTS: A total of 121 participants from 18 countries registered to participate in the study, with 87 (72\%), 77 (64\%), and 79 (65\%) registrants completing the three rounds, respectively. The final guidance document included 18 respiratory physiotherapy and rehabilitation recommendations, mapped over seven clinical scenarios for patients (1) not requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) requiring mechanical ventilation, (3) with no concurrent fracture of the shoulder girdle complex, (4) with a concurrent fracture of the shoulder girdle complex, (5) with/without concurrent upper limb orthopedic injuries, (6) undergoing surgical stabilization of rib fractures, and (7) at hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: This guidance provides key recommendations for respiratory physiotherapy and physical rehabilitation of patients with rib fractures. It could also be used to inform future research priorities in the field. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic/Care Management; Level IV.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of the tensor fascia latae (TFL) muscle is often clinically implicated in many musculoskeletal disorders. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature of the TFL muscle to determine whether there are differences in its structure and activation between individuals with and without lower limb musculoskeletal conditions. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, and LILACS was undertaken from year of inception to 9 July 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Studies that directly investigated the structure or activity of the TFL muscle between individuals with a lower limb musculoskeletal condition and a pain-free control group. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included (n\,=\,556 participants), eight reporting structure and ten activation of the TFL muscle. Conditions included lateral hip pain, hip joint pathology, ACL injury, iliotibial band syndrome, and patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis. Meta-analysis identified with low confidence (p value\,=\,0.07) a small tendency towards hypertrophy in the affected side of participants with hip joint diseases (SMD 0.37, 95\% CI [- 0.02, 0.77]). Moderate effect sizes were found for a higher cross-sectional area of the TFL/sartorius ratio in abductor tendon tear (SMD 0.74; 95\% CI [0.05, 1.43, p value\,=\,0.04), and for a smaller body mass normalized TFL volume in patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis (SMD - 0.61; 95\% CI [- 1.23, 0.00], p value\,=\,0.05). Normalised electromyography~(EMG) amplitude did not differ between groups for any condition, but when EMG was analysed as linear envelopes or synergies, some differences in pattern of TFL activation were observed between individuals with lateral hip pain and controls. Timing of TFL activation did not differ between individuals with knee conditions and controls. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Common clinical assumptions of the role of TFL muscle in lower limb musculoskeletal conditions are not well investigated and poorly supported by current research. There are contradictory findings on the muscle size of TFL. Differing methodology in muscle activation studies precludes a clear interpretation for comparison between groups.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Return-to-activity (RTA) assessments are commonly administered after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) to manage the patient's postoperative progressions back to activity. To date, few data are available on the clinical utility of these assessments to predict patient outcomes such as secondary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury once the athlete has returned to activity. OBJECTIVE: To identify the measures of patient function at 6 months post-ACLR that best predict RTA and second ACL injury at a minimum of 2 years after ACLR. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 patients with primary, unilateral ACLR completed functional assessments at approximately 6 months post-ACLR. Of these, 192 (82.1\%) completed follow-up at {$\geq$}2 years post-ACLR. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The 6-month functional assessments consisted of patient-reported outcomes, isokinetic knee-flexor and -extensor strength, and single-legged hopping. We collected RTA and secondary ACL injury data at {$\geq$}2 years after ACLR. RESULTS: Of the patients who were able to RTA (n = 155), 44 (28.4\%) had a subsequent ACL injury, 24 (15.5\%) to the ipsilateral graft ACL and 20 (12.9\%) to the contralateral ACL. A greater proportion of females had a secondary injury to the contralateral ACL (15/24, 62.5\%), whereas a greater proportion of males reinjured the ipsilateral ACL graft (15/20, 75.0\%; P = .017). Greater knee-extension symmetry at 6 months increased the probability of reinjury (B = 0.016, P = .048). Among patients with RTA at {$<$}8 months, every 1\% increase in quadriceps strength symmetry at 6 months increased the risk of reinjury by 2.1\% (B = 0.021, P = .05). Among patients with RTA at {$>$}8 months, every month that RTA was delayed reduced the risk of reinjury by 28.4\% (B = -0.284, P = .042). Descriptive statistics of patient function stratified between the early and delayed RTA groups can be found in the Supplemental Table (available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0407.20.S1). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with more symmetric quadriceps strength at 6 months post-ACLR were more likely to experience another ACL rupture, especially those who returned to sport at {$<$}8 months after the index surgery. Clinicians should be cognizant that returning high-functioning patients to activity at {$<$}8 months post-ACLR may place them at an increased risk for reinjury.},

Although the International Headache Society recognises this type of headache as a distinct disorder, some clinicians remain sceptical. Laboratory and clinical studies have shown that pain from upper cervical joints and muscles can be referred to the head. Clinical diagnostic criteria have not proved valid, but a cervical source of pain can be established by use of fluoroscopically guided, controlled, diagnostic nerve blocks. In this Review, we outline the basic science and clinical evidence for cervicogenic headache and indicate how opposing approaches to its definition and diagnosis affect the evidence for its clinical management. We provide recommendations that enable a pragmatic approach to the diagnosis and management of probable cervicogenic headache, as well as a rigorous approach to the diagnosis and management of definite cervical headache.},

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta IL-6, IL-8, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were investigated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique in 39 patients with lumbar disc herniation and sciatica. Pain duration and pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) were recorded at inclusion, and a clinical examination was performed evaluating neurological findings. The extent of disc herniation (protrusion or extrusion/sequestration) was evaluated perioperatively. Normal concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were present in CSF and serum in almost all patients with lumbar disc herniation. The concentrations of IL-8 in CSF were increased in 12 out of 39 patients, and these increased levels of IL-8 correlated to a short duration of pain and to more pronounced herniation (extrusion or sequestration). No relationship between IL-8 concentrations in CSF and pain intensity, positive neurological findings or a positive straight leg-raising (SLR) test was found. The observation of increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF in patients with a short duration of symptoms supports the concept of the initial involvement of inflammatory mechanisms after a disc herniation. The finding that most of the patients with increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF had an extrusion or a sequestration may suggest that the increase in IL-8 is related to mechanical nerve root compression, but may also indicate a biochemical effect exerted by the herniated disc on the surrounding tissue. Further studies on the potential role of IL-8 as a biomarker for disc herniation are warranted.},

  abstract = {Traditional rehabilitation for shoulder dislocation has a success rate of only 20\%. The body blade has been hypothesized to strengthen the muscles stabilizing the shoulder girdle by training the contractile tissues directly and also indirectly affecting the joint and surrounding noncontractile tissues when responding to rapid positional changes and mechanical energy. Shoulder dislocation negatively affects both the active (musculature) and passive (joint and ligaments) stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint. Therefore, the purpose of this case report was to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic exercise using the body blade in the conservative management of an individual with glenohumeral instability. The patient, an 18-year-old male, dislocated his left shoulder after a wave crashed on top of him. Intervention included therapeutic exercise using the body blade. Measures were taken at examination, re-evaluation (6th visit), and discharge (11th visit). According to the 11-point numeric pain rating scale, worst pain was reduced from 4 to 0. Glenohumeral ROM measures at discharge were all within normal range except external rotation (deficit of 10 degrees), compared to the initial ROM deficits of 10-35\% of noninvolved values. Post intervention strength, as assessed by handheld dynamometry, revealed deficits only in scapular retraction compared to the uninvolved side (21\% compared to an initial deficit of 39\%). Other muscle groups showing deficits from 20\% to 40\% at initial examination exceeded the comparative strength of the other limb at discharge. The SPADI and WOSI scores were reduced from 13 to 0 and 482 to 46, from initial examination to discharge, respectively. Furthermore 6 months post episode of care the patient reported no recurrent dislocation of the involved shoulder. The success rate of an exercise program with individuals who have dislocated their glenohumeral joint is poor. After 11 visits of physical therapy using the body blade the patient improved in ROM, strength, and function.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an exercise protocol, with and without manual therapy, on scapular kinematics, function, pain, and mechanical sensitivity in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. BACKGROUND: Stretching and strengthening exercises have been shown to effectively decrease pain and disability in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. There is still conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of adding manual therapy to an exercise therapy regimen. METHODS: Forty-six patients were assigned to 1 of 2 groups, one of which received a 4-week intervention of stretching and strengthening exercises (exercise alone) and the other the same intervention, supplemented by manual therapy targeting the shoulder and cervical spine (exercise plus manual therapy). All outcomes were measured preintervention and postintervention at 4 weeks. Outcome measures were scapular kinematics in the scapular and sagittal planes during arm elevation, function as determined through the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, pain as assessed with a visual analog scale, and mechanical sensitivity as assessed with pressure pain threshold. RESULTS: Independent of the intervention group, small, clinically irrelevant changes in scapular kinematics were observed postintervention. A significant group-by-time interaction effect (P = .001) was found for scapular anterior tilt during elevation in the sagittal plane, with a 3.0{$^\circ$} increase (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -1.5{$^\circ$}, 7.5{$^\circ$}) relative to baseline in the exercise-plus-manual therapy group compared to a decrease of 0.3{$^\circ$} (95\% CI: -4.2{$^\circ$}, 4.8{$^\circ$}) in the exercise-alone group. Pain, mechanical sensitivity, and the DASH score improved similarly for both groups by the end of the intervention period. CONCLUSION: Adding manual therapy to an exercise protocol did not enhance improvements in scapular kinematics, function, and pain in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. The noted improvements in pain and function are not likely explained by changes in scapular kinematics.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Single-subject research design using 4 consecutive patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether treatment using soft tissue therapy (ART or Active Release Technique), stretching, and strengthening of the hip abductors, hip external rotators, and tensor fascia latae muscles reduces pain and improves self-reported hip function in patients with acetabular labral tears who also have posterolateral hip pain of suspected myofascial origin. BACKGROUND: Acetabular labral tears cause pain in some but not all patients. Pain commonly presents anteriorly but may also present posteriorly and laterally. The standard of care is arthroscopic repair, which helps many but not all patients. It is possible that these patients may present with extra-articular contributions to their pain, such as myofascial pain, making their clinical presentation more complex. No previous study has assessed soft tissue therapy as a treatment option for this subset of patients. METHODS: This A-B-A design used repeated measures of the Hip Outcome Score and visual analog scale for pain. Four patients were treated for 6 to 8 weeks, using a combination of soft tissue therapy, stretching, and strengthening for the hip abductors, external rotators, and tensor fascia latae. Data were assessed visually, statistically, and by comparing mean differences before and after intervention. RESULTS: All 4 patients experienced both statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in posterolateral hip pain and hip-related function. Three patients also experienced reduction in anteromedial hip pain. CONCLUSION: Myofascial hip pain may contribute to hip-related symptoms and disability in patients with acetabular labral tears and posterolateral hip pain. These patients may benefit from soft tissue therapy combined with stretching and strengthening exercises targeting the hip abductors, tensor fascia latae, and hip external rotator muscles.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by an incompletely reversible limitation in airflow. A physiological variable--the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)--is often used to grade the severity of COPD. However, patients with COPD have systemic manifestations that are not reflected by the FEV1. We hypothesized that a multidimensional grading system that assessed the respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD would better categorize and predict outcome in these patients. METHODS: We first evaluated 207 patients and found that four factors predicted the risk of death in this cohort: the body-mass index (B), the degree of airflow obstruction (O) and dyspnea (D), and exercise capacity (E), measured by the six-minute-walk test. We used these variables to construct the BODE index, a multidimensional 10-point scale in which higher scores indicate a higher risk of death. We then prospectively validated the index in a cohort of 625 patients, with death from any cause and from respiratory causes as the outcome variables. RESULTS: There were 25 deaths among the first 207 patients and 162 deaths (26 percent) in the validation cohort. Sixty-one percent of the deaths in the validation cohort were due to respiratory insufficiency, 14 percent to myocardial infarction, 12 percent to lung cancer, and 13 percent to other causes. Patients with higher BODE scores were at higher risk for death; the hazard ratio for death from any cause per one-point increase in the BODE score was 1.34 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.26 to 1.42; P{$<$}0.001), and the hazard ratio for death from respiratory causes was 1.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.48 to 1.77; P{$<$}0.001). The C statistic for the ability of the BODE index to predict the risk of death was larger than that for the FEV1 (0.74 vs. 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: The BODE index, a simple multidimensional grading system, is better than the FEV1 at predicting the risk of death from any cause and from respiratory causes among patients with COPD.},

  abstract = {In young adult, the most common etiology of acute ischemic brain infarction are arterial dissections and cardiogenic embolic stroke. Vertebral artery dissection without preceding trauma history is quite rare in young ischemic stroke patients. Postural headache is even more atypical presentation for vertebral artery dissection. It is often misdiagnosed as spontaneous intracranial hypotension. We described a 37-year-old male suffering from acute onset postural headache with stroke in evolution during hospitalization. The initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mislead to diagnosis of ischemic lesion. Nevertheless, with the aid of single photon emission computed tomography, we are confident the patient was afflicted with ischemic/hemorrhagic lesion, instead of neoplasm or demyelinating diseases. Lateral medullary syndrome was confirmed on the repeated brain MRI. His general condition improved with steady gait and clear articulation without easychoking after adequate hydration and rehabilitation training with aspirin as secondary prevention. Cranial artery dissections is a crucial differential diagnosis while thunderclap headache happens even related to postural change without obvious neurological deficit in the beginning presentations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Acute as well as chronic pain syndromes are common after whiplash trauma and exercise therapy is proposed as one possible intervention strategy. The aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate the effect of exercise therapy in patients with Whiplash-Associated Disorders for the improvement of neck pain and neck disability, compared with other therapeutic interventions, placebo interventions, no treatment, or waiting list. CONTENT: The review was registered in Prospero (CRD42017060356) and conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A literature search in PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane from inception until January 13, 2020 was combined with a hand search to identify eligible randomized controlled studies. Abstract screening, full text assessment and risk of bias assessment (Cochrane RoB 2.0) were conducted by two independent reviewers. SUMMARY: The search identified 4,103 articles. After removal of duplicates, screening of 2,921 abstracts and full text assessment of 100 articles, 27 articles that reported data for 2,127 patients were included. The included articles evaluated the effect of exercise therapy on neck pain, neck disability or other outcome measures and indicated some positive effects from exercise, but many studies lacked control groups not receiving active treatment. Studies on exercise that could be included in the random-effect meta-analysis showed significant short-term effects on neck pain and medium-term effects on neck disability. OUTLOOK: Despite a large number of articles published in the area of exercise therapy and Whiplash-Associated Disorders, the current evidence base is weak. The results from the present review with meta-analysis suggests that exercise therapy may provide additional effect for improvement of neck pain and disability in patients with Whiplash-Associated Disorders.},

Some tears may require surgical intervention, especially if they are associated with boney pathology such as femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). A protocol for nonoperative treatment of the hip labral tears is not well established. OBJECTIVE: To identify current nonoperative treatment options, comorbidities, sports participation, and outcomes of adolescent athletes who were diagnosed with hip labral tears. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A regional tertiary level medical and academic institution. PARTICIPANTS: Physically active 8- to 20-year-old males and females who were diagnosed with hip labral tears in 2010 to 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nonoperative treatment interventions including physical therapy (PT), intraarticular injection (IAI), the type of sports participation, and comorbidity were extracted. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics and {$\chi$} tests were used with a priori alpha level {$<$}0.05. RESULTS: Among 76 adolescent athletes who were diagnosed with hip labral tear, 52 (68.4\%) had PT, 55 (72.4\%) received IAI, and 43 (56.6\%) experienced both PT and IAI interventions. Top 3 sports participated were dance (18.4\%), soccer (14.5\%), and gymnastics (7.9\%). The most common comorbidity was FAI, which was observed in 46 individuals (60.5\%). Although there was no difference in a proportion of FAI cases between sexes, a greater proportion of surgical cases were observed among hip labrum-injured athletes with FAI compared with those without FAI (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent athletes with hip labral tears often receive PT, IAI, and a combination of both, as nonoperative treatment options in this study cohort. The adolescent athletes who sustained hip labral tears with comorbidity of FAI had significantly greater proportion of surgical cases after nonoperative treatments.},

METHODS: This narrative review combines scientific evidence with clinical guidelines based on the current literature to highlight the different components of the rehabilitation of glenohumeral instability. RESULTS: Depending on the specific characteristics of the instability pattern, the severity, recurrence, and direction, the therapeutic approach may be adapted to the needs and demands of the athlete. In general, attention should go to (1) restoration of rotator cuff strength and inter-muscular balance, focusing on the eccentric capacity of the external rotators, (2) normalization of rotational range of motion with special attention to the internal rotation ROM, (3) optimization of the flexibility and muscle performance of the scapular muscles, and (4) gradually increasing the functional sport-specific load on the shoulder girdle. The functional kinetic chain should be implemented throughout all stages of the rehabilitation program. Return to play should be based on subjective assessment as well as objective measurements of ROM, strength, and function. CONCLUSIONS: This paper summarizes evidence-based guidelines for treatment of glenohumeral instability. These guidelines may assist the clinician in the prevention and rehabilitation of the overhead athlete. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Expert opinion, Level V.},

An understanding of specific muscles affected will help guide targeted rehabilitation. Objectives of this case-control study were to compare gluteal and tensor fasciae latae (TFL) muscle size and quality (fatty infiltration) in women with symptomatic GTPS to asymptomatic age-matched female controls. Magnetic resonance imaging of 16 women with GTPS (mean age 55.75\,years, range 23-69) and 15 asymptomatic controls (mean age 55.60\,years, range 31-66) was undertaken. Muscle volumes of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and TFL were calculated. Fatty infiltration was rated using the Goutallier classification system for all muscles in their entirety, as well as anterior and posterior segments of gluteus medius and minimus. Muscle volumes and fatty infiltration were compared between groups. Significantly smaller muscle volumes were identified in the symptomatic group for the upper (P =\,0.01) and lower (P =\,0.04) portions of gluteus maximus, gluteus medius (P =\,0.03), and gluteus minimus (P =\,0.02). There was no difference in TFL (P =\,0.18). Symptomatic participants displayed significantly greater fatty infiltration in gluteus maximus upper (P =\,0.021) and lower (P =\,0.049) when adjusted for BMI, and gluteus minimus (P =\,0.018), particularly in the posterior portion (P =\,0.04). Anterior gluteus minimus demonstrated high amounts of fatty infiltration in both groups. Gluteal muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration in women with GTPS suggests gluteus maximus and minimus may be an important target for rehabilitation. Clin.

  abstract = {Microinstability is an increasingly recognized diagnosis in young athletes presenting with hip pain. Causes of microinstability may include abnormality of the hip bony anatomy, acetabular labral tears, joint capsule laxity or injury, and muscle dysfunction. Borderline hip dysplasia is an increasingly recognized factor predisposing to microinstability. The capsuloligamentous structures of the hip, particularly the iliofemoral ligament, provide important restraints to femoral head motion, and iatrogenic defects can predispose patients to instability after surgery. Injury to the acetabular labrum may disrupt its important hip-stabilizing properties including the suction seal and improved acetabular depth. Hip muscle weakness or imbalance may result in increased femoral head motion within the acetabulum. The diagnosis of hip microinstability can be challenging, and the history is often nonspecific. Physical examination maneuvers include the anterior apprehension, prone instability, axial distraction, and abduction-hyperextension-external rotation tests. Radiographic features may include borderline hip dysplasia, femoral head-neck junction cliff sign, and an elevated femoral-epiphyseal acetabular roof index. Magnetic resonance arthrography may demonstrate a capsular defect, capsular thinning, or labral pathology. Diagnostic intra-articular injection of anesthetic can confirm the intra-articular nature of the pathology. Management of hip microinstability focuses on strengthening the dynamic stabilizers of the hip through focused physical therapy. Surgery may be considered in recalcitrant cases where symptoms persist despite optimization of hip stabilizer strength. In such cases, addressing the primary source of instability through labral repair or reconstruction and capsular repair or plication can be considered. In highly selected cases, surgery can result in excellent outcomes.},

In addition, the clinical features of migraine overlap with secondary causes of headache, making a careful history and deliberative evaluation for warning symptoms or signs of a secondary headache disorder of paramount importance.

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A Medline search was performed via PubMed (through June 2010) using the search terms cuboid, syndrome, subluxed, locked, fault, dropped, peroneal, lateral, plantar, and neuritis with the Boolean term AND in all possible combinations. Retrieved articles were hand searched for additional relevant references. RESULTS: Cuboid syndrome is thought to arise from subtle disruption of the arthrokinematics or structural congruity of the calcaneocuboid joint, although the precise pathomechanic mechanism has not been elucidated. Fibroadipose synovial folds (or labra) within the calcaneocuboid joint may play a role in the cause of cuboid syndrome, but this is highly speculative. The symptoms of cuboid syndrome resemble those of a ligament sprain. Currently, there are no definitive diagnostic tests for this condition. Case reports suggest that cuboid syndrome often responds favorably to manipulation and/or external support. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based guidelines regarding cuboid syndrome are lacking. Consequently, the diagnosis of cuboid syndrome is often based on a constellation of signs and symptoms and a high index of suspicion. Unless contraindicated, manipulation of the cuboid should be considered as an initial treatment.},

  abstract = {A herniated disc in the spine is a condition during which a nucleus pulposus is displaced from intervertebral space. It is a common cause of back pain. The patients who experience pain related to a herniated disc often remember an inciting event that caused their pain. Unlike mechanical back pain, herniated disc pain is often burning or stinging, and may radiate into the lower extremity. Furthermore, in more severe cases, there can be associated with weakness or sensation changes. In the spine, a disc or a nucleus pulposus is localized between vertebral bodies.~It supports the spine by acting as a shock-absorbing cushion.~In some instances, a herniated disc injury can compress the nerve or the spinal cord that causes pain consistent with nerve compression or spinal cord dysfunction, also known as myelopathy. Herniated discs can be very painful. Unfortunately, there are limited effective conservative treatment modalities with significant effectiveness. Within a few weeks, most cases of painful disc herniation heal. In many instances, the herniation of the disc does not cause that patient any pain. Herniated discs are often seen on MRIs of asymptomatic patients. Imaging is not indicated in a patient with signs and symptoms of a stable herniated disc until six weeks of persistent symptoms. MRI is the imaging modality of choice. Most cases of herniated disc heal conservatively, but refractory cases may require interventional procedures or surgical repair. Epidural corticosteroid injections are effective pain relievers for disc herniation in the short term, while discectomy is more effective than conservative management until one year following surgery~. Providers need to remain aware of treating the patient with a herniated disc and monitor for severe or rapidly progressing neurological changes; this would be an indication for urgent neurosurgical referral.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The contribution of rib fractures to prolonged pain and disability may be underappreciated and undertreated. Clinicians are traditionally taught that the pain and disability of rib fractures resolves in 6 to 8 weeks. METHODS: This study was a prospective observation of 203 patients with rib fractures at a level 1 trauma center. Chest wall pain was evaluated by the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) pain rating index (PRI) and present pain intensity (PPI). Prolonged pain was defined as a PRI of 8 or more at 2 months after injury. Prolonged disability was defined as a decrease in 1 or more levels of work or functional status at 2 months after injury. Predictors of prolonged pain and disability were determined by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: One hundred forty-five male patients and 58 female patients with a mean injury severity score (ISS) of 20 (range, 1 to 59) had a mean of 5.4 rib fractures (range, 1 to 29). Forty-four (22\%) patients had bilateral fractures, 15 (7\%) had flail chest, and 92 (45\%) had associated injury. One hundred eighty-seven patients were followed 2 months or more. One hundred ten (59\%) patients had prolonged chest wall pain and 142 (76\%) had prolonged disability. Among 111 patients with isolated rib fractures, 67 (64\%) had prolonged chest wall pain and 69 (66\%) had prolonged disability. MPQ PPI was predictive of prolonged pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 2.5), and prolonged disability (OR, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.5 to 3.4). The presence of significant associated injuries was predictive of prolonged disability (OR, 5.9; 95\% CI, 1.4 to 29).

Further investigation into more effective therapies that prevent prolonged pain and disability after rib fractures is needed.},

This review article aims to provide a clear explanation of the common concepts in shoulder instability and how they relate to the assessment and management of patients. There are sections covering the mechanisms of shoulder stability, the clinical assessment of patients and imaging techniques. Beyond that there is a discussion on the common classifications systems used and the typical management options. Some patients fall into reasonably well defined categories of classification and in these cases, the management plan is relatively easy to define. Unfortunately, other patients can elude simple classification and in these instances their management requires very careful consideration. Further research may help to facilitate a better understanding of management of the patients in this latter group.},

METHODS: Medical literature was queried for all reports of this condition, systematically abstracted, and analyzed. An illustrative case that provides the most definitive support for a vascular cause is presented. Treatment considerations based on prior cases and expert opinions are provided. RESULTS: Sixty-four cases of surfer's myelopathy have been reported to date. This atraumatic thoracic/conus medullaris myelopathy with only a 42\% neurological recovery rate almost uniformly affects young, healthy, novice surfers who have no pre-existent spinal disease. Symptoms usually start with back pain and rapidly progress to complete or incomplete myelopathy. T2 magnetic resonance images show increased signal in the central spinal cord within 24 to 72 hours. Gadolinium enhancement and diffusion-weighted imaging are not helpful. Angiography has been underused. Angiogram in our case showed the absence of a right T12 radicular artery and no artery of Adamkiewicz, which, along with clinical findings, support the vascular origin theory. Incomplete cases often improve within 24 hours of onset, whereas no improvement has been reported for American Spinal Injury Association class A cases. Several acute interventions have been tried. Steroids are most common, and patients receiving steroids improved 55\% of the time with no reported adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Surfer's myelopathy is a clinical entity associated with complete deficit in {$>$}50\% of cases. Its prognosis is almost exclusively dictated by severity at presentation/nadir. Thus, publicizing this rare but serious condition (within and outside the medical literature) may be an effective intervention.},

However, the current evidence is based on assessments of healthy individuals. We aimed to investigate unplanned jump landing kinetics and knee kinematics in ACL-reconstructed (ACLR) and non-injured athletes. METHODS: A total of 30 male professional soccer players (n\,=\,15 ACLR after return to play, n\,=\,15 matched controls) performed six drop landings onto a force plate. As a neurocognitive challenge requiring decision-making, a diode flashing in randomly selected colors indicated the requested landing location. Knee joint kinematics (flexion, valgus and tibial rotation angles) assessed with a 10-camera motion capture system, vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), time to stabilization (TTS) and length of the center of pressure (COP) trace (all analyzed from force plate data) were calculated. Cognitive function was assessed using the CNS Vital Signs battery. RESULTS: The ACLR group produced lower knee flexion angles than the control group (median [interquartile range] 50.00{$^\circ$} [6.60] vs. 55.20{$^\circ$} [4.45], p\,=\,.02). In addition, path length of the center of pressure (379~mm [56.20] vs. 344~mm [37.00], p\,=\,.04) and ground reaction force (3.21 N/kg [0.66] vs. 2.87 N/kg [0.48], p\,=\,.01) were higher for the ACLR group. No differences were found for knee valgus (p\,=\,.96), tibial rotation (p\,=\,.83) and TTS (p\,=\,.82). ACLR participants scored lower for reaction time (p\,=\,.02) and processing speed (p\,=\,.01). Unfavorable knee biomechanics were more often related to cognitive function in the ACLR group than in the control group (p\,{$<$}\,.05). CONCLUSIONS: Impaired reactive decision-making during athletic movement may contribute to the high re-injury risk in individuals with ACLR. Prospective studies confirming potential cause-effect relationships are warranted.},

  abstract = {The hip labrum has many functions, including shock absorption, joint lubrication, pressure distribution, and aiding in stability, with damage to the labrum associated with osteoarthritis. The etiology of labral tears includes trauma, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), capsular laxity/hip hypermobility, dysplasia, and degeneration. Labral tears present with anterior hip or groin pain, and less commonly buttock pain. Frequently, there are also mechanical symptoms including clicking, locking, and giving way. The most consistent physical examination finding is a positive anterior hip impingement test. Because of the vast differential diagnosis and the need for specialized diagnostic tools, labral tears frequently go undiagnosed during an extended period of time. Evaluation usually begins with plain radiographs to assess for dysplasia, degeneration, and other causes of pain. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography scans are unreliable for diagnosis, magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) is the diagnostic test of choice, with arthroscopy being the gold standard. Typically, treatment begins conservatively with relative rest and non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents, with physical therapy (PT) being controversial. Often, surgical treatment is necessary, which entails, arthroscopic debridement of labral tears and surgical repair of associated structural problems.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gluteal insufficiency is a common and challenging complaint. New concepts in pathobiomechanics and improved clinical understanding of chronic gluteal dysfunction have unmasked gluteus medius (GMed) tears as an underlying cause of enhanced trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). These tears are often missed or misdiagnosed as bursitis, but lead to prolonged chronic peritrochanteric pain. Clinic: The clinical signs are often dull pain on the lateral hip aspect, reduced hip abduction strength with positive Trendelenburg testing and a tendency for the leg to external rotation, as the internal rotation strength is reduced. IMAGING: Radiography and ultrasound may be used to confirm the diagnosis, whereas MRI is the modality of choice for imaging. Compensatory hypertrophy of the tensor fascia latae muscle (TFL) and fatty involution (especially of the GMed) are also seen. THERAPY: Conservative treatment regimens for partial thickness tears involve hip joint centering and strengthening of abductor muscles, sparing TFL. Failed conservative treatment and full thickness tears are treated surgically. Partial tears can be addressed endoscopically with suture anchors for tendon footprint reconstruction. Larger tears involving the anterior and/or lateral facets of the tendon or failed conservative treatment are repaired with minimally invasive open reduction techniques. Double row suture anchor techniques provide anatomical tendon footprint reconstruction. Postoperative rehabilitation is prolonged, due to high acting forces in the peritrochanteric region, and needs to be carried out under professional surveillance. CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of gluteal tendon tears is often the only solution in the treatment of chronic hip pain due to gluteal insufficiency. Available data suggest that reduction in pain and restoration of abduction power can be achieved in mid-term follow-up.},

The medial epicondyle is a bony protrusion on the medial elbow with its own ossification center, separate from the main distal humeral physis, known as an apophysis. This growth center at the medial epicondyle develops around 6-7 years of age and typically fuses by age 15.~The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) and the flexor-pronator muscle groups originate at the medial epicondyle and serve to stabilize the elbow against valgus stress.~ Medial epicondyle apophysitis occurs due to excessive and repetitive valgus stress placed on the apophysis before its closure. Over time, the repetitive strain results in a traction-type injury and may cause pathologic widening and inflammation of the apophysis or even an avulsion fracture.~MEA may~cause significant morbidity in young athletes, who must temporarily refrain from their chosen sport until the pain improves and healing occurs. Proper prevention, identification, and prompt treatment of MEA can allow young adolescents to continue in the sports they enjoy without prolonged interruptions in their athletic seasons.},

METHODS: Patients who underwent single-level surgery due to cervical radiculopathy with at least a 60\% reduction in preoperative symptoms or recovery of muscle power after surgery were included. The observed clinical symptoms (pain, paresthesia, motor weakness) were compared to those of typical cervical dermatomes and myotomes. RESULTS: Among the 227 patients reviewed, 142 (62.6\%) had a standard dermatomal pattern, and 74 of 110 (67.3\%) had a standard myotomal pattern. The myotome of C5/6 radiculopathy showed much more variance than those of other cervical segments. Among the patients with severe motor weakness (muscle strength {$\leq$} grade 3 or obvious muscle atrophy), all those with involvement of root C5, C7, and C8 showed a typical pattern (C4/5: 13 of 13 patients, C6/7: 5 of 5 patients, C7/T1: 3 of 3 patients), while only 2 of the 6 patients (33.3\%) with severe motor weakness caused by C5/6 radiculopathy fit the typical pattern. CONCLUSION: Among various symptoms, cervical myotome is of great value in determining the pathological level. However, it should be noted that there is high variability in human dermatomes and myotomes, especially for motor weakness due to C6 root compression, which is more variable than others.},

Investigators have categorized this condition as vascular versus neurogenic, where vascular TOS can be subcategorized as either arterial or venous and neurogenic TOS can subcategorized as either true or disputed. The thoracic outlet anatomical container presents with several key regional components, each capable of compromising the neurovascular structures coursing within. Bony and soft tissue abnormalities, along with mechanical dysfunctions, may contribute to neurovascular compromise. Diagnosing TOS can be challenging because the symptoms vary greatly amongst patients with the disorder, thus lending to other conditions including a double crush syndrome. A careful history and thorough clinical examination are the most important components in establishing the diagnosis of TOS. Specific clinical tests, whose accuracy has been documented, can be used to support a clinical diagnosis, especially when a cluster of positive tests are witnessed.},

CONCLUSION: The clinician uses clinical examination results to design a rehabilitation program that focuses on correcting specific problems that were previously identified. Disputed neurogenic TOS is best managed with a trial of conservative therapy before surgical treatment options are considered. Cases that are resistant to conservative treatment may require surgical intervention. True neurogenic TOS may require surgical intervention to relieve compression of the neural structures in the thoracic outlet. Surgical management is required for cases of vascular TOS because of the potentially serious complications that may arise from venous or arterial compromise. Post-operative rehabilitation is recommended after surgical decompression to address factors that could lead to a reoccurrence of the patient's symptoms.},

This injury may be seen in both adolescent and skeletally mature athletes and shares several characteristics with the "Superior Labral tear from Anterior to Posterior (SLAP)" lesion in the shoulder. METHODS: We present a case example, as well as a detailed anatomic description of the pathological condition. RESULTS: As the rectus femoris crosses two joints it is exposed to substantial forces during muscle contraction. Considering the peri-articular origin of the reflected head at the superior aspect of the acetabular rim, a powerful eccentric contraction of the rectus femoris muscle or traction related to sudden knee flexion may cause an avulsion injury of the rectus femoris as well as a concomitant labral tear. CONCLUSIONS: A strain injury of the rectus femoris muscle, which is common in young athletic patients, may cause a concomitant tear of the acetabular labrum. Therefore, we recommend further diagnostic work-up in cases with prolonged hip pain and impaired hip function following an AIIS injury in order to identify any associated peri- and intra-articular damage. In our experience these patients seldom need aggressive surgical management.},

This makes understanding its diagnostic process, presentation and treatment difficult due to lack of evidence-based consensus. This review aims to propose a novel classification for subtypes of MDI. METHODS: A systematic search was performed on PubMed Medline and Embase. A combination of the following 'MeSH' and 'non-MesH' search terms were used: (1) Glenohumeral joint[tiab] OR Glenohumeral[tiab] OR Shoulder[tiab] OR Shoulder joint[tiab] OR Shoulder[MeSH] OR Shoulder joint[MeSH], (2) Multidirectional[tiab], (3) Instability[tiab] OR Joint instability[MeSH]. Sixty-eight publications which met our criteria were included. RESULTS: There was a high degree of heterogeneity in the definition of MDI. Thirty-one studies (46\%) included a trauma etiology in the definition, while 23 studies (34\%) did not. Twenty-five studies (37\%) excluded patients with labral or bony injuries. Only 15 (22\%) studies defined MDI as a global instability (instability in all directions), while 28 (41\%) studies considered MDI to be instability in two directions, of which one had to include the inferior direction. Six (9\%) studies included the presence of global ligamentous laxity as part of the definition. To improve scientific accuracy, the authors propose a novel AB classification which considers traumatic etiology and the presence of hyperlaxity when subdividing MDI. CONCLUSION: MDI is defined as symptomatic instability of the shoulder joint in two or more directions. A comprehensive classification system that considers predisposing trauma and the presence of hyperlaxity can provide a more precise assessment of the various existing subtypes of MDI.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the muscle activity of patients with multidirectional instability treated in a conservative or complex manner (capsular shift with postoperative rehabilitation) and the muscle activity of stable shoulder joints before and after treatment during pull, push, and elevation of upper extremities and during overhead throw. SCOPE: The study was carried out on 34 patients with multidirectional shoulder instability treated non-operatively, on 31 patients with multidirectional shoulder instability treated operatively, and on 50 healthy subjects. Signals were recorded by surface EMG from eight different muscles. The mean and standard deviation of the maximum amplitude of normalized voluntary electrical activity for the different movement types and time broadness values during overhead throw were determined for each muscle in all groups and compared with each other. CONCLUSION: The centralization of the glenohumeral joint and the reduction of instability is attempted to be ensured by the organism through increasing the role of rotator cuff muscles (p=0.009) and decreasing the role of the deltoid, biceps brachii, and pectoralis maior muscles (p=0.007). At patients after short-term and long-term conservative treatment, the maximum amplitude of normalized voluntary electrical activity of stabilizer muscles is significantly higher (p=0.006), and that of accelerator muscles is significantly lower (p=0.005) and the time broadness is significantly longer (p=0.01) than that of the control group. At patients after complex treatment (open capsular shift with postoperative conservative rehabilitation) the characteristic of the muscle pattern is similar (p=0.19) to the control group. The complex treatment resolves the labral ligamentous abnormalities by operative treatment and restores the impaired muscular control by postoperative rehabilitation, whereas the conservative treatment restores only the muscular control.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The medicinal treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) is mostly symptomatic to relieve pain and incapacity with analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), drugs with well-known risks. Complementary medicines might reduce the symptoms of OA and decrease the need for NSAIDs. This study tested the effects of a food supplement, Phytalgic, on pain and function in patients with osteoarthritis and their use of analgesic and NSAIDs. METHODS: A randomized double-blind parallel-groups clinical trial compared Phytalgic (fish-oil, vitamin E, Urtica dioica) to a placebo for three months, in 81 patients with OA of the knee or hip using NSAIDs and/or analgesics regularly. The main outcome measures were use of NSAIDs (in Defined Daily Doses per day - DDD/day) or analgesics (in 500 mg paracetamol-equivalent tablets per week (PET/week) measured each month, and Western Ontario-McMaster University Osteo-Arthritis Index (WOMAC) function scales. RESULTS: After three months of treatment, the mean use of analgesics in the active arm (6.5 PET/week) vs. the placebo arm (16.5) was significantly different (P {$<$} 0.001) with a group mean difference of -10.0 (95\% CI: -4.9 to -15.1). That of NSAIDs in the active arm (0.4 DDD/day) vs the placebo arm (1.0 DDD/day) was significantly different (P = 0.02) with a group mean difference of - 0.7 DDD/day (95\% CI: -0.2 to -1.2). Mean WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness and function in the active arm (respectively 86.5, 41.4 and 301.6) vs the placebo arm (resp. 235.3, 96.3 and 746.5) were significantly different (P {$<$} 0.001) with group mean differences respectively of -148.8 (95\% CI: -97.7 to -199.9), -54.9 (95\% CI: -27.9 to -81.9) and -444.8 (95\% CI: -269.1 to -620.4). CONCLUSIONS: The food supplement tested appeared to decrease the need for analgesics and NSAIDs and improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00666523.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is a common overuse injury in runners with parallels to our findings of overuse in Greco Roman wrestlers. Despite research indicating coordination and movement-based factors about the hip, no studies were found using functional motor control (FMC) in runners or wrestlers with ITBS. Thus, we compared FMC exercises and therapeutic exercises (TEs) on pain, function, muscle strength, and range of motion (ROM) in national-level Greco Roman wrestlers with ITBS. DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Sixty national-level Greco Roman wrestlers diagnosed with ITBS were randomly assigned to 8~weeks of FMC exercises, TE, and a control group (20 individuals for each group). Pain (visual analog scale), function (triple hop test for distance, single-leg vertical jump test, and agility T test), muscle strength (handheld dynamometer), and ROM (goniometer) were measured at baseline and 8~weeks after intervention as posttest. RESULTS: Although both interventions significantly reduced pain (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .87), improved function (triple hop test P = .004, {$\eta$}2 = .94; single-leg vertical jump P = .002, {$\eta$}2 = .93; and T test P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .93) and strength (hip abduction (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .52), hip external rotation (P = .02, {$\eta$}2 = .95), knee flexion (P {$\leq$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .94), and knee extension (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .91) compared with the control group, FMC showed more significant improvements in comparison with TE. Significant differences (P = .001) were observed between FMC and TE compared with the control group in ROM outcome. However, TE was more effective than FMC in improving ROM hip abduction (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .93), hip adduction (P = .000, {$\eta$}2 = .92), hip internal rotation (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .92), and hip external rotation (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .93). CONCLUSION: FMC exercises were superior to TE in terms of pain, function, and muscle strength, whereas TE was more effective for improving ROM. FMC exercise is suggested as an effective intervention for improvement of the outcomes related to ITBS in national-level Greco Roman wrestlers.},

A comprehensive recognition of referred pain is important for clinicians when dealing with it. The purpose of this study is to summarize the current understanding of referred pain, including its pathogenesis, characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Referred pain arises not only from pathologies primarily involving local tissue but also from lesions in distant structures. Central sensitization of convergent neurons and peripheral reflexes of dichotomizing afferent fibers are two theories proposed to explain the pathological mechanism of referred pain. Because syndromes related to referred pain of different origins overlap each other, it is challenging to define referred pain and identify its originating lesions. Although various approaches have been used in the diagnosis and treatment of referred pain, including conservative treatment, blockade, radiofrequency, and surgery, management of referred pain remains a clinical challenge. SUMMARY: Unlike radicular pain and neuropathic pain, referred pain is a less studied area, despite being common in clinics. Referred pain can derive from various spinal structures, and blockage helps identify the primary pathology. Due to the heterogeneity of referred pain, treatment outcomes remain uncertain. Further studies are needed to improve our understanding of referred pain.},

  abstract = {Multidirectional instability (MDI) of the shoulder was first described in 1980 as a complex condition of the shoulder defined by instability in 2 or more planes of motion.~The shoulder joint is unique in the way it provides a tremendous range of motion. In fact, it has the greatest mobility of any joint in the human body. However, mobility and stability are inversely proportional, and the complex interplay between the stabilizers of the shoulder works with little margin for error before instability occurs. Therefore the balance between the extraordinary physiologic range of motion and shoulder stability has proved to be delicate. The primary responsibility of the shoulder is to position the hand in space. Hence, some activities show preference toward mobility (swimming) while others favor stability (weight lifting, football lineman).~Shoulder stability is maintained through both dynamic and static stabilizers. The dynamic structures responsible for joint stability include the rotator cuff muscles, the tendon of the long head of the biceps, and the periscapular musculature. The static stabilizers include the glenohumeral articular congruity, glenoid labrum complex, glenohumeral ligaments as well as the negative pressure created within the joint. Shoulder instability becomes symptomatic once the motion of the humeral head exceeds the boundaries set by the glenoid labrum complex. This is a result of pathology within the static and/or dynamic stabilizers. Shoulder instability was originally thought to fall within one of two categories. The first is Traumatic Unilateral with Bankart lesion treated Surgically (TUBS). The second category is Atraumatic, Multidirectional, Bilateral, which typically responds to Rehabilitation or Inferior capsular shift (AMBRI). Although these two categories offer a simple classification system for MDI, they are oversimplified and do not fully represent the full spectrum of pathologic laxity. As we have discovered more about the MDI process, modifications have been made to the original simplistic classification.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent and disabling cause of low back and leg pain in older persons, affecting an estimated 103 million persons worldwide. Most are treated nonoperatively. Approximately 600\,000 surgical procedures are performed in the US each year for lumbar spinal stenosis. OBSERVATIONS: The prevalence of the clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis in US adults is approximately 11\% and increases with age. The diagnosis can generally be made based on a clinical history of back and lower extremity pain that is provoked by lumbar extension, relieved by lumbar flexion, and confirmed with cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nonoperative treatment includes activity modification such as reducing periods of standing or walking, oral medications to diminish pain such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. In a series of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis followed up for up to 3 years without operative intervention, approximately one-third of patients reported improvement, approximately 50\% reported no change in symptoms, and approximately 10\% to 20\% of patients reported that their back pain, leg pain, and walking were worse. Long-term benefits of epidural steroid injections for lumbar spinal stenosis have not been demonstrated. Surgery appears effective in carefully selected patients with back, buttock, and lower extremity pain who do not improve with conservative management. For example, in a randomized trial of 94 participants with symptomatic and radiographic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, decompressive laminectomy improved symptoms more than nonoperative therapy (difference, 7.8 points; 95\% CI, 0.8-14.9; minimum clinically important difference, 10-12.8) on the Oswestry Disability Index (score range, 0-100). Among persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and concomitant spondylolisthesis, lumbar fusion increased symptom resolution in 1 trial (difference, 5.7 points; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 11.3) on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical dimension score (range, 0-100), but 2 other trials showed either no important differences between the 2 therapies or noninferiority of lumbar decompression alone compared with lumbar decompression plus spinal fusion (MCID, 2-4.9 points). In a noninferiority trial, 71.4\% treated with lumbar decompression alone vs 72.9\% of those receiving decompression plus fusion achieved a 30\% or more reduction in Oswestry Disability Index score, consistent with the prespecified noninferiority hypothesis. Fusion is associated with greater risk of complications such as blood loss, infection, longer hospital stays, and higher costs. Thus, the precise indications for concomitant lumbar fusion in persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis remain unclear. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Lumbar spinal stenosis affects approximately 103 million people worldwide and 11\% of older adults in the US. First-line therapy is activity modification, analgesia, and physical therapy. Long-term benefits from epidural steroid injections have not been established. Selected patients with continued pain and activity limitation may be candidates for decompressive surgery.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients who underwent physiotherapy for treatment of symptomatic acetabular labral tears were enrolled. We evaluated the severity of the acetabular labral tears, which were classified based on the Czerny classification system using 3-T MRI. Clinical findings of microinstability and extra-articular pathologies of the hip joint were also examined. The International Hip Outcome Tool 12 (iHOT12) was use for evaluation of outcome scores pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: The mean iHOT12 score showed significant improvement from 44.0 to 73.6 in 4.7 months. Compared with pre-intervention scores, significantly higher post-intervention iHOT12 scores were observed for Czerny stages I and II tears (all P{$<$}0.01). However, no significant difference was observed between pre-intervention and post-intervention iHOT12 scores for stage III tears (P=0.061). In addition, seven patients (20.0\%) had positive microinstability findings and 22 patients (62.9\%) had findings of extra-articular pathologies. Of the 35 patients, eight patients (22.9\%) underwent surgical treatment after failure of conservative management; four of these patients had Czerny stage III tears. CONCLUSION: The iHOT12 score of patients with acetabular labral tears was significantly improved by physiotherapy in the short-term period. Improvement of the clinical score by physiotherapy may be poor in patients with severe acetabular labral tears. Determining the severity of acetabular labral tears can be useful in determining treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {Horner syndrome is a rare condition classically presenting with partial ptosis (drooping or falling of upper eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and facial anhidrosis (loss of sweating) due to a disruption in the sympathetic nerve supply. It is primarily acquired following damage to the sympathetic nerve supply, but rare cases of congenital forms have~been seen. Therefore, treatment is centered around identifying and appropriate~management of the underlying secondary cause. The syndrome has several names, such as Bernard-Horner syndrome (French-speaking countries), Horner syndrome (English speaking countries), oculosympathetic palsy, and Von Passow syndrome (Horner syndrome in association with iris heterochromia). The syndrome was first described by Francois Pourfour du Petit in 1727 when considering results from an animal experiment involving resection of intercostal nerves and subsequent changes seen in the ipsilateral eye and face. It was outlined more thoroughly by the French physiologist Claude Bernard in 1852, followed by several physicians who offered different interpretations. The condition was formally described and later named after Swiss ophthalmologist Johann Friedrich Horner in 1869. Anatomy Understanding the sympathetic innervation of the eye is vital to understanding the features of this syndrome. The nerve supply is constituted by three different neurons, starting from the posterolateral hypothalamus and ending as the long ciliary nerves to supply the iris dilator and superior tarsal muscles (Muller muscle). The first-order neurons originate from the hypothalamus and descend through the midbrain and pons uncrossed, terminating at the C8-T2 level of the spinal cord in the intermediolateral cell columns (ciliospinal center of Budge). Second-order preganglionic neurons exit at the T1 level of the spinal cord to enter the cervical sympathetic chain, where the fibers ascend to synapse in the superior cervical ganglion at the C3-C4 level. Third-order, postganglionic fibers branch off into the sudomotor and vasomotor fibers, which follow the external carotid artery and innervate the sweat glands and blood vessels of the face. The remaining fibers ascend along the internal carotid artery in the carotid plexus to eventually enter the cavernous sinus, where they join the abducens nerve (CN VI). The fibers then exit the cavernous sinus to enter the orbit via the superior orbital fissure and the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) as the long ciliary nerves.},

  abstract = {Stress injuries represent a spectrum of injuries ranging from periostitis, caused by inflammation of the periosteum, to a complete stress fracture that includes a full cortical break. They are relatively common overuse injuries in athletes that are caused by repetitive submaximal loading on a bone over time. Stress injuries are often seen in running and jumping athletes and are associated with increased volume or intensity of training workload. Most commonly, they are found in the lower extremities and are specific to the sport in which the athlete participates. Upper extremity stress injuries are much less common than lower extremity stress injuries, but when they do occur, they are most commonly seen in the ulna. Similar to the lower extremity injuries, upper extremity stress injuries are the result of overuse and fatigue. Rib stress fractures are an uncommon site of stress injuries. First rib fractures are the most common, and these are seen in pitchers, basketball players, weightlifters, and ballet dancers. Stress fractures in ribs 4 through 9 are seen in competitive rowers, and posteromedial rib stress fractures can be seen in golfers. Stress fractures of the pelvis can be vague clinically and mimic other causes of groin and hip pain, for example, adductor strain, osteitis pubis, or sacroiliitis. The most common location is the ischiopubic ramus and sacrum. These injuries are seen most commonly in runners. Femoral neck stress fractures make up approximately 11\% of stress injuries in athletes. The patient complains of hip or groin pain which is worse with weight bearing and range of motion especially internal rotation. There are 2 types of femoral neck stress fractures: tension-type (or distraction) fractures and compression-type fractures. Tension-type femoral neck stress fractures involve the superior-lateral aspect of the neck and are at highest risk for complete fracture; thus, these should be detected early. Compression-type fractures are seen in younger athletes and involve the inferior-medial femoral neck. A trial of non-surgical management can be attempted for patients without a visible fracture line on radiographs in compression type injuries. This injury is common in runners. Stress fractures of the femoral shaft are well documented in the literature, and in one study among military recruits, they represented 22.5\% of all stress fractures. Patients typically complain of poorly localized, insidious leg pain often mistaken for muscle injury. An exam is often nonfocal, although the ``fulcrum test'' test can be used by providers to localize the affected pain and suggest the diagnosis. If there is no evidence of a cortical break on imaging, a non-surgical approach can be attempted. The patella is a rare location for a stress fracture and can be oriented either transverse or vertical. Transverse fractures are at higher risk for displacement and immobilization is recommended. Tibial stress injuries are the most common location of stress reactions and fractures. Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), also known as shin splints or tibial periostitis, can be difficult to distinguish from medial tibial stress fractures. Typically, the patient will be tender over the medial posterior edge of the tibia often made worse with a motor exam. Stress injuries will present with pain during activities of daily living, while MTSS is generally limited to exertional activity. Anterior cortex tibial stress fractures are less common than the posteromedial ones and are found in jumping and leaping athletes. These patients may have the ``dreaded black line'' on x-ray. They are at a greater risk of nonunion and full cortical break and require aggressive conservative therapy. If that fails, surgical management such as an intramedullary rod or flexible plate is indicated. Stress fractures of the medial tibial plateau are uncommon but can be confused for meniscus injury or pes anserine bursitis, and thus, a high index of suspicion is needed. Fibular stress fractures are common and most commonly located in the lower third of the fibula, proximal to the tibiofibular ligament. Patients will have reproducible pain on palpation of the affected bone. Medial malleolus stress fractures are uncommon. Running and jumping athletes can develop vertical stress fractures at the junction of the medial malleolus and tibial plafond. If full cortical disruption is identified, surgical fixation is typically indicated. Calcaneal stress fractures present as localized tenderness over the heel of the calcaneus posterior to the talus. Patients will have a positive squeeze test. Stress fractures can develop in the navicular, medial cuneiform, and lateral process of the talus. Navicular stress fractures are difficult to diagnose early on and are at high risk of nonunion due to poor vascular flow, primarily in the middle third. These are common in basketball players and runners. They are usually tender on the navicular bone. Metatarsal stress fractures account for 9\% of all stress fractures in athletes. The second and third metatarsals are most commonly affected and are usually in the neck or distal shaft. They will be point tender with localized swelling over the affected bone. Dancers fracture is a stress fracture at the base of the second metatarsal. Stress fractures distal to the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal are termed Jones fractures but must be distinguished from an acute Jones fracture. Sesamoid stress injuries of the great toe present as gradual unilateral plantar pain with the medial (tibial) sesamoid most frequently affected. Direct tenderness or pain with passive extension of the toe aid in diagnosis.},

  abstract = {\&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Introduction:\&lt;/b\&gt; Multidirectional shoulder instability (MDI) occurs when the shoulder is dislocating in at least two directions. The patient usually experiences pain with apprehension and a clicking sensation inside the joint. So far, a few classification scales of shoulder instability have been made. Despite this fact, MDI is highly problematic for clinicians in diagnosis and treating.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Aim:\&lt;/b\&gt; This article presents the current trends in the conservative treatment of multidirectional instability, assess effectiveness of rehabilitation and indicates the directions of MDI research.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Material and methods:\&lt;/b\&gt; In order to find current literature and conduct a critical analysis, the following scientific database was used: Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), MEDLINE and PubMed. We chose four articles which included a comparison of conservative and operative treatment, and four which evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Results:\&lt;/b\&gt; Low quality evidence shows priority of surgical treatment over conservative treatment. The protocol developed by Watson obtains a statistically significant advantage over the Burkhead and Rockwood protocol. Discussion: The effectiveness of rehabilitation reaches different levels. Rehabilitation should last from 3 to 12 months. If rehabilitation does not achieve a sufficient effect, arthroscopic methods of reducing the volume of the articular capsule should be considered. Due to the small number of scientific reports and their quality, the obtained data should be interpreted with caution. Much further research is required to create a precise and most effective algorithm.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Conclusion:\&lt;/b\&gt; Rehabilitation exercises play an important role in the treatment of multidirectional instability of the shoulder joint, especially when the patient has not had an injury. Exercise types and load should be dosed individually. At present, the protocol described by Watson is the most effective.\&lt;/br\&gt.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several functional outcome scores have been proposed for the evaluation of shoulder instability. Most are multiple-item questionnaires, which can be time-consuming and difficult for patients to understand, as well as leading to lack of compliance. The Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score is a single question that has recently gained widespread acceptance based on its simplicity and correlation with more complex scoring systems. The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation of a new modified version of the SANE score, the SANE-instability score, with the Rowe score after treatment for shoulder instability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated a consecutive series of 253 patients (268 shoulders) treated surgically or nonoperatively for shoulder instability between November 2017 and November 2019, for whom the Rowe and SANE-instability scores were collected before treatment and/or after treatment. The SANE-instability score was assessed with the following question: "What is the overall percent value of your shoulder if a completely stable shoulder represents 100\%?"~Correlations were tested using the Pearson~coefficient (r) and interpreted as very high (r = 0.90-1.00), high (r = 0.70-0.89), moderate (r = 0.50-0.69), low (r = 0.30-0.49), or negligible (r = 0.00-0.29). Subgroup analyses were also performed to observe correlation variations according to follow-up length (before treatment and at 6, 12, 26, 52, and 104 weeks after treatment), patient age ({$<$}20, 20-29, 30-39, or {$\geq$}40 years), and type of treatment (nonoperative or surgical). RESULTS: The overall correlation between the SANE-instability and Rowe scores was high (r = 0.85, P {$<$} .001). Subgroup analyses revealed that the correlation between the 2 scores was high before treatment (r = 0.74); moderate at 6 and 12 weeks after treatment (r = 0.66 and r = 0.57, respectively); and then high at 26, 52, and 104 weeks after treatment (r = 0.75, r = 0.75, and r = 0.78, respectively) (P {$<$} .001). The correlation was high across all types of treatment (r = 0.76-0.85), high for patients aged {$\geq$} 20 years (r = 0.80-0.86), and very high for patients aged {$<$} 20 years (r = 0.93) (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a significant correlation between the SANE-instability and Rowe scores before and after treatment, as well as across all patient age groups and treatments. Owing to its high simplicity, the SANE-instability score could be used as an alternative to the Rowe score for patient follow-up at various time points.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Anterior hip or groin pain is a common complaint for which people are referred for physical therapy, with the hip region being involved in approximately 5\% to 9\% of injuries in high school athletes.1 Although anterior hip pain is known to result from a number of musculoskeletal and systemic pathologies, a tear of the acetabular labrum is a recent addition to the list that is of particular interest to physical therapists. This mechanically induced pathology is thought to result from excessive forces at the hip joint2,3 and has been proposed as part of a continuum of hip joint disease that may result in articular cartilage degeneration.2 Although the number of recent articles in the orthopedic literature identifying acetabular labral tears as a source of hip pain is increasing, labral tears often evade detection, resulting in a long duration of symptoms, greater than 2 years on average, before diagnosis.4--8 Studies have shown that 22\% of athletes with groin pain9 and 55\% of patients with mechanical hip pain of unknown etiology2 were found to have a labral tear upon further evaluation. In order to provide the most appropriate intervention for patients with anterior hip or groin pain, physical therapists should be knowledgeable about all of the possible sources and causes of this pain, including a tear of the acetabular labrum and the possible factors contributing to these tears. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review the anatomy and function of the acetabular labrum and present current concepts on the etiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of labral tears.},

METHODS: A systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was performed. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases using various combinations of the keywords "shoulder," "multidirectional instability," "dislocation," "inferior instability," "capsulorrhaphy," "capsular plication," "capsular shift," "glenoid," "humeral head," "surgery," and "glenohumeral," over the years 1966 to 2014 was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-four articles describing patients with open capsular shift, arthroscopic treatment, and conservative or combined management in the setting of atraumatic MDI of the shoulder were included. A total of 861 shoulders in 790 patients was included. The median age was 24.3 years, ranging from 9 to 56 years. The dominant side was involved in 269 (58\%) of 468 shoulders, whereas the nondominant side was involved in 199 (42\%) shoulders. Patients were assessed at a median follow-up period of 4.2 years (ranging from 9 months to 16 years). Fifty-two of 253 (21\%) patients undergoing physiotherapy required surgical intervention for MDI management, whereas the overall occurrence of redislocation was seen in 61 of 608 (10\%) shoulders undergoing surgical procedures. The redislocation event occurred in 17 of 226 (7.5\%) shoulders with open capsular shift management, in 21 of 268 (7.8\%) shoulders with arthroscopic plication management, in 12 of 49 (24.5\%) shoulders undergoing arthroscopic thermal shrinkage, and in 11 of 55 (22\%) shoulders undergoing arthroscopic laser-assisted capsulorrhaphy. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic capsular plication and open capsular shift are the best surgical procedures for treatment of MDI after failure of rehabilitative management. Arthroscopic capsular plication shows results comparable to open capsular shift. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV studies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Few studies have investigated the role of dietary factors on knee osteoarthritis (OA) progression. We examined the prospective association of dietary fat intake with radiographic progression of knee OA. METHODS: In the Osteoarthritis Initiative, 2,092 participants with radiographic knee OA and having baseline dietary data were followed at yearly intervals up to 48 months. Dietary intakes of fatty acids were assessed with the Block Brief Food Frequency Questionnaire. To evaluate radiographic progression of knee OA, we used quantitative joint space width (JSW) between the medial femur and tibia of the knee based on fixed-flexion posteroanterior radiographs. Linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to test the association between dietary fat and JSW loss over time. RESULTS: We observed significant positive relationships of total fat and saturated fatty acids (SFA) intakes with JSW loss. With increasing quartiles of total fat intake, JSW decreases over 48 months were 0.26 mm, 0.27 mm, 0.31 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively (P\,=\,0.02 for trend). Similar association was observed between SFA intake and JSW loss. In contrast, higher intakes of mono- (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and higher ratio of PUFA to SFA were associated with a reduced JSW loss. CONCLUSION: High intakes of total fat and SFA may be associated with increased structural knee OA progression, while MUFA and PUFA may reduce radiographic progression. Replication of these novel findings in other prospective studies is needed to confirm if reduction in SFA intake and increase in unsaturated fat intake lead to delayed knee OA progression.},

  abstract = {Wallenberg syndrome was first described in 1808 by Gaspard Vieusseux. However, a more detailed description given in 1895 by Adolf Wallenberg~identified this condition as infarction of the lateral medulla oblongata following occlusion of the vertebral artery (VA) or Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Wallenberg syndrome is also called lateral medullary or posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome. This neurological disorder is associated with various symptoms that result from damage to the lateral segment of the medulla posterior to the inferior olivary nucleus. Anatomy The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) usually originates from the vertebral artery at an average distance of approximately 16 or 17 mm below the vertebrobasilar junction. The vertebral artery, arising from the subclavian artery, is classically divided into four segments. The fourth segment of the vertebral artery gives off the PICA, the largest branch of the vertebral artery. The trunk of PICA is divided into five segments: 1. The anterior medullary segment begins at the origin of the PICA. It ends at the level of a rostrocaudal line that passes through the most prominent part of the inferior olive. 2. The lateral medullary segment extends from the level of the most prominent point of the olive to the level of the origin of the glossopharyngeal (CN IX), vagus (CN X), and accessory (CN XI) rootlets. 3. The tonsillomedullary segment begins where the PICA passes posterior to the CN IX-XI and ends at the midpoint of the PICA's ascent toward the roof of the fourth ventricle along the medial surface of the tonsil. 4. The telovelotonsillar segment begins where the PICA ascends to the mid-level of the medial surface of the tonsil and ends where the artery exits the fissures between the tonsil, vermis, and hemisphere to reach the suboccipital surface. 5. The cortical segment begins where the PICA leaves the groove between the vermis, tonsil, and hemisphere and includes the terminal cortical branches. The trunk of PICA gives rise to perforating, choroidal, and cortical branches. The PICA supplies the medulla, the choroid plexus, the tela choroidea of the fourth ventricle, the tonsils, the inferior vermis, and the inferior aspects of the cerebellar hemispheres.~Furthermore, the PICA mostly supplies the choroid plexus on the roof and the median opening of the fourth ventricle and~provides the majority of branches of the choroid plexus.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of proprioceptive training on knee function and proprioception following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Ovid, EBMSCO-host, ScienceDirect, CNKI, VIP, WanFang Data and CBM were searched until 2nd October 2020. REVIEW METHODS: Trials with proprioceptive training for patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were included. Study screening, data extraction, risk of bias and quality assessments were performed independently by two researchers. We performed a stratified analysis based on the quality of the study. Sensitivity analyses were performed if the heterogeneity was high. RESULTS: Seventeen trials with 878 participants were included, and 12/17 with low quality. After stratified analysis, the pooled effect of high-quality studies showed significant improvement for proprioceptive training group in range of motion (P\,{$<$}\,0.05, I2\,=\,0\%), but no differences in Cincinnati knee rating system score (P\,{$>$}\,0.05, I2\,=\,83\%), hop test (P{$>$}0.05, I2\,=\,0\%) and proprioception (P\,=\,0.17, I2\,=\,77\%) compared to conventional training group; while the pooled effect of low-quality studies showed significant differences in knee functional improvement (P\,{$<$}\,0.00001, I2\,=\,69\%), but no difference in proprioception (P {$>$} 0.05, I2\,=\,84\%) between two groups. The pooled effect of all studies showed a significant benefit in both function and proprioception. CONCLUSION: The effects of proprioceptive training on knee functional and proprioceptive improvement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is mixed. It is more likely that proprioceptive training in high-quality studies has few detectable effects and that low-quality studies show an effect because of an unconscious bias. A large well designed high-quality study needs to be undertaken in the future.},

The thoracic spine is most commonly involved, although involvement can include the thoracolumbar/lumbar region as well . Most commonly, diagnosis is made in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years who present after their parents notice a postural deformity or ``hunchbacked'' appearance. Pain in the affected hyperkyphotic region may also be the cause of initial evaluation . There is a hereditary component associated with this condition, although the exact mode of transmission is still unclear. This is supported by the fact that incidence is higher in monozygotic versus dizygotic twins .},

Once considered an uncommon entity, labral tears have recently received wider recognition as a source of symptoms and functional limitation. Information regarding acetabular labral tears and their association to capsular laxity, femoral acetabular impingement (FAI), dysplasia of the acetabulum, and chondral lesions is emerging. Physical therapists should understand the anatomical structures of the hip and recognize how the clinical presentation of labral tears is difficult to view isolated from other hip articular pathologies. Clinical examination should consider lumbopelvic and extra-articular pathologies in addition to intra-articular pathologies when assessing for the source of symptoms and functional limitation. If a labral tear is suspected, further diagnostic testing may be indicated. Although up-and-coming evidence suggests that information obtained from patient history and clinical examination can be useful, continued research is warranted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of our examination techniques.},

PURPOSE: To compare hip arthroscopy versus nonoperative management for symptomatic labral tears in patients aged {$\geq$}40 years with limited radiographic osteoarthritis. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: This single-surgeon, parallel randomized controlled trial included patients aged {$\geq$}40 years with limited osteoarthritis (T{\"o}nnis grades 0-2) who were randomized 1:1 to arthroscopic surgery with postoperative physical therapy (SPT) or physical therapy alone (PTA). Patients who received PTA and achieved unsatisfactory improvement were permitted to cross over to SPT after completing {$\geq$}14 weeks of physical therapy (CO). The primary outcomes were the International Hip Outcome Tool-33 score and modified Harris Hip Score at 24 months after surgery, and secondary outcomes included other patient-reported outcome measures and the visual analog scale for pain. The primary analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis using linear mixed-effects models. Sensitivity analyses included modified as-treated and treatment-failure analyses. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients were included, with 52 (53.6\%) patients in the SPT group and 45 (46.4\%) patients in the PTA group. Of the patients who underwent PTA, 32 (71.1\%) patients crossed over to arthroscopy at a mean of 5.10 months (SD, 3.3 months) after physical therapy initiation. In both intention-to-treat and modified as-treated analyses, the SPT group displayed superior mean patient-reported outcome measure and pain scores across the study period for nearly all metrics relative to the PTA group. In the treatment-failure analysis, the SPT and CO groups showed greater improvement across all metrics compared with PTA; however, post hoc analyses revealed no significant differences in improvement between the SPT and CO groups. No significant differences were observed between groups in rates of total hip arthroplasty conversion. CONCLUSION: In patients {$\geq$}40 years of age with limited osteoarthritis, hip arthroscopy with postoperative physical therapy led to better outcomes than PTA at a 24-month follow-up. However, additional preoperative physical therapy did not compromise surgical outcomes and allowed some patients to avoid surgery. When surgery is indicated, age {$\geq$}40 years should not be considered an independent contraindication to arthroscopic acetabular labral repair.

OBJECTIVES: To explore therapists' perceptions of useful diagnostic criteria to identify first rib dysfunction. METHODS: A Delphi survey over four rounds involving~international manual therapy experts~who were asked to agree on which items were most useful in identifying first rib dysfunction. RESULTS: Consensus ({$>$}70\% agreement)~was reached on key aspects of first rib dysfunction being first rib mobility restriction, upper limb symptom distribution, and a subclassification into two subgroups was suggested. The main clinical findings suggested were: painful and restricted neck movements and shoulder girdle loading activities; positive~Upper Limb Neural Test 1;~direct palpation of first rib, neural structures, and scalene muscles; pain and hypomobility of first rib accessory movements with improvement after mobilization. The~cervical rotation lateral-flexion test was considered a useful, although not widely used test among~the experts. Its diagnostic accuracy~and interpretation in isolation~was questioned. CONCLUSIONS: This Delphi study produced a cluster of clinical tests aimed to identify first rib dysfunction in patients with neck and/or shoulder conditions. However, these need to be tested out in further research to establish reliability and validity.},

  abstract = {One of the most prevalent degenerative musculoskeletal conditions is lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSS), which is characterized by narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal that pressures the nerve roots and cauda equine. LSS, when treated surgically, usually presents with foot drop as its major complication. Foot drop is a common presentation of several clinical diseases, traditionally characterized as severe weakening of ankle and toe dorsiflexion. Foot drop has a great impact on patients' lives, lowering their quality of life and affecting their activities of daily living. Ankle dorsiflexion weakness leads to foot drop and a high-stepping gait, which can cause multiple falls and accidents. This case study aimed to assess the efficacy of a customized physiotherapy program in a 50-year-old woman with paraparesis along with left foot drop and post-surgery complications following lumbar decompression and spinal fusion at L3-S1 (lumbar-sacral) level after a jerk experienced by her while working out in the gym. The objective was to determine the impact of individualized exercises on the patient's strength, gait, balance, and pelvic floor function over a 12-week rehabilitation period. The interventions included lower limb exercises (stretching exercises, strengthening exercises, and weight-bearing exercises), pelvic floor exercises, and core stability training. The findings demonstrated significant improvements in the patient's functional outcomes, as evidenced by enhanced scores in the Berg Balance Scale, Manual Muscle Testing, Dynamic Gait Index, Barthel Index, and Stanmore Assessment Questionnaire. Notable progress was observed in the strength, balance, gait, and pelvic floor function, highlighting the positive influence of targeted physiotherapeutic interventions. This case underscores the importance of tailored exercise plans in addressing the complexities of post-surgery challenges, emphasizing the potential for comprehensive recovery and improved overall quality of life through personalized physiotherapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought to determine whether continuous passive motion (CPM) usage improves outcomes following arthroscopic hip surgery involving acetabular labral repair. Our hypothesis is that CPM usage reduces pain and pain medication use and improves quality of life in individuals who undergo hip arthroscopy. METHODS: We created a randomized controlled trial consisting of 54 patients who underwent arthroscopic acetabular labral repair. Patients were randomized to two groups, one with CPM use post-operatively and one without. Primary outcomes measured were pain level, patient satisfaction, and quality of life. Parameters used to measure these outcomes were self-reported pain scores on Likert scale, frequency of analgesic medication use, and self-reported scores on Hip Outcome Score Activity of Daily Living (HOS ADL). These parameters were compared between the two randomized groups using t-test for statistical analysis. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the treatment and control groups in terms of patient characteristics. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of HOS ADL scores, although the patients in the control group demonstrated a trend toward higher HOS ADL scores. The patients in the CPM group had a statistically significant decrease in pain levels after surgery compared to patients in the control group. The total morphine equivalent dose consumed in the first two post-operative weeks was higher in the control group compared to the CPM group, although this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Use of CPM resulted in lower pain level scores in patients after hip arthroscopy. Although there is no statistical difference in quality of life or quantity of analgesics consumed post-operatively, patients who used CPM tended to have lower HOS ADL scores (which is desirable) and less consumption of pain medication. A study with a larger sample of patients might elucidate more differences between the two groups. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II, therapeutic.},

Thirty-seven hips with an MRI confirmed labral tear were prospectively enrolled in a graduated management protocol created for adolescents. The protocol began with activity modification and focused physical therapy. Patients with persistent symptoms were offered an intraarticular corticosteroid injection. Those with continued symptoms were treated with arthroscopic surgery. The modified Harris hip score (mHHS) and nonarthritic hip score (NAHS) were recorded at the initial visit. Patients were contacted by telephone at 1, 2, and 5\,years from enrollment for repeat assessment with mHHS and NAHS. At presentation, the mean mHHS and NAHS for the entire cohort was 66.4\,\,{\textpm}\,\,11.4 and 70.2\,\,{\textpm}\,\,12.6, and these values improved significantly to 89.3\,\,{\textpm}\,\,10.6 and 87.0\,\,{\textpm}\,\,11.4 at a mean follow-up of 35.7\,\,{\textpm}\,\,18.3\,months (range 11.7-64.4\,months). Forty-two percent of hips were managed with physical therapy and activity modifications alone, 28\% of hips progressed to a steroid injection but did not require surgery, and 31\% required arthroscopic intervention. Seventy-three percent of hips treated with activity modification alone, 80\% treated with an injection, and 82\% of hips treated with arthroscopic repair met the minimal clinically significant difference (MCID) (P\,=\,0.859).

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are characterized by abnormal lipid metabolism manifested as altered fatty acid (FA) profiles of synovial fluid and tissues and in the way dietary FA supplements can influence the symptoms of especially RA. In addition to classic eicosanoids, the potential roles of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA)-derived specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM) have become the focus of intensive research. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge of the roles of FA and oxylipins in the degradation or protection of synovial joints. RECENT FINDINGS: There exists discordance between the large body of literature from cell culture and animal experiments on the adverse and beneficial effects of individual FA and the lack of effective treatments for joint destruction in OA and RA patients. Saturated 16:0 and 18:0 induce mostly deleterious effects, while long-chain n-3 PUFA, especially 20:5n-3, have positive influence on joint health. The situation can be more complex for n-6 PUFA, such as 18:2n-6, 20:4n-6, and its derivative prostaglandin E2, with a combination of potentially adverse and beneficial effects. SPM analogs have future potential as analgesics for arthritic pain. Alterations in FA profiles and their potential implications in SPM production may affect joint lubrication, synovial inflammation, pannus formation, as well as cartilage and bone degradation and contribute to the pathogeneses of inflammatory joint diseases. Further research directions include high-quality randomized controlled trials on dietary FA supplements and investigations on the significance of lipid composition of microvesicle membrane and cargo in joint diseases.},

HYPOTHESIS: It was hypothesized that introducing conservative physical therapy (PT) preoperatively along with a slow progression to return to activity using a structured, patient-guided postoperative program would improve patient outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of patients who received a hip arthroscopy, were at least 18 years old, and who had completed the following patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at 1-year follow-up: modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Hip Outcome Score, Nonarthritic Hip Score, International Hip Outcome Tool-33, and Lower Extremity Functional Scale. Patients who underwent previous surgery on the ipsilateral hip and those with cartilage erosion down to exposed subchondral bone (Outerbridge grade 4) were excluded. Paired-samples t tests were used to compare the change in PRO scores at 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year follow-up, and the percentage of patients who achieved minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and substantial clinical benefit (SCB) thresholds on the mHHS were stratified according to their Outerbridge grade (0-3). RESULTS: Overall, 202 patients (53\% female, 47\% male) were included in the analysis. Significant improvement was seen from 3 to 6 months on all PRO measures and from 6 months to 1 year on all but the mHHS (P {$<$} .05 for all except the mHHS). A significantly smaller percentage of patients with Outerbridge grade 3 cartilage damage achieved the MCID and SCB on the mHHS compared with those with grade 0, both at 6 months (grade 3 vs 0: 20\% vs 63.2\% [MCID]; 18.0\% vs 52.6\% [SCB]; both P = .03) and 1 year (grade 3 vs 0: 22.0\% vs 57.9\% [MCID]; 14.0\% vs 52.6\% [SCB]; both P {$<$} .05). CONCLUSION: A structured, patient-guided PT protocol after arthroscopic acetabular labral repair can significantly improve postoperative outcomes.},

Recent guidelines suggest physical therapy is beneficial, yet the guidance for specific interventions is unclear. The purpose of highlighting these cases was to describe the outcomes and the clinical reasoning process driving conservative management of subjects with FAIS and ALTs that were deemed surgical candidates. STUDY DESIGN: Case Series. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Six subjects (20 - 65 years old) with confirmed FAIS and/or ALTs were included. Subjects were assigned to different treatment pathways based on their individual presentation. Three subjects were categorized as having primary mobility impairments and three were categorized with primary neuromuscular control impairments. Treatment intensity was adjusted according to the individual nature of symptoms, and on average lasted 81 days. OUTCOMES: Clinically important improvements were seen on all self-reported outcome measures (International Hip Outcome Tool - 33, Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Patient Specific Functional Scale, and Global Rating of Change). At two years, none of the subjects had elected surgical management. DISCUSSION: These cases illustrate the clinical reasoning process utilized to prioritize subjects' treatment along a continuum of neuromuscular control and mobility. The treatment approach also illustrates successful management of potential surgical candidates that elected to forego surgery after satisfactory completion of conservative management.

The purpose of this case report is to describe a clinical pathway for conservative management of a patient with an acute acetabular labral tear and femoroacetabular impingement. Case Description The patient was an 18-year-old woman with recent onset of right groin pain who underwent intra-articular corticosteroid injection and therapeutic exercise for the management of an acute acetabular labral tear identified on radiographic imaging. Prior to physical therapy, the patient received an intra-articular hip injection for diagnostic purposes and pain relief. Upon initial evaluation, the patient presented with improved pain but with continued kinesthetic deficits, inflexibility, muscle imbalances, and reproduction of symptoms with end-range hip motions. A physical therapy plan was implemented using neuromuscular re-education to address her continued impairments. Outcomes Marked improvements were noted at discharge and 6-month follow-up for pain, strength, and function as demonstrated on the Patient-Specific Functional Scale, global rating of change scale, and International Hip Outcome Tool-33. Discussion This case demonstrates a clinical pathway for collaborative medical management of a patient with confirmed intra-articular pathology.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of false-positive findings of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) shoulder maneuvers, Adson's test (AT), costoclavicular maneuver (CCM), elevated arm stress test (EAST), and supraclavicular pressure (SCP) in healthy subjects. METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study was performed in a medical school and affiliated emergency medicine residency program setting. Participants included healthy adult volunteers without symptoms of TOS. The shoulder maneuvers AT, CCM, EAST, and SCP were performed in randomized order for 30 sec, 30 sec, 3 min, and 30 sec, respectively. Pulse quality and the presence and timing of pain or paresthesias were assessed. RESULTS: 53 subjects were enrolled, including 27 women, aged 29.7 +/- 6.4 years (range 21-58 years). AT, CCM, EAST, and SCP resulted in an altered pulse in 11\%, 11\%, 62\%, and 21\%; pain in 0\%, 0\%, 21\%, and 2\%; and paresthesias in 11\%, 15\%, 36\%, and 15\% of cases, respectively. The following outcomes had reasonable false-positive rates (upper 95\% confidence limit): pain with the AT (7\%), CCM (7\%), SCP (10\%), or any 2 TOS shoulder maneuvers (10\%); discontinuing the EAST because of symptoms (16\%); or any symptom with 3 (13\%) or 4 (7\%) TOS shoulder maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS: In a study of TOS shoulder maneuvers in healthy subjects, the outcomes of pulse alteration or paresthesias were unreliable in general. However, TOS shoulder maneuvers have reasonably low false-positive rates when a positive outcome is defined as pain after AT, CCM, or SCP; discontinuation of the EAST secondary to pain; pain in the same arm with {$>$} or =2 maneuvers; or any symptom in the same arm with {$>$} or =3 maneuvers.},

Anecdotal evidence, clinical and laboratory, suggests that OA bone contains more fat. However, conversion of osteoblasts to adipocytes is reported in OP and this would suggest that the more porous OP cancellous bone would have a high fat content. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that OA bone contains more fat than OP bone. METHODS: Cores of cancellous bone were obtained from femoral heads of patients undergoing surgery for either OA or OP. Lipids were extracted using chloroform-methanol, weighed and expressed as a fraction of core mass and volume. A fatty acid analysis was performed using gas chromatography. RESULTS: OA bone contained twice as much fat per unit volume of tissue as OP. Levels of n-6 fatty acids were elevated in OA, especially arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6) which was almost double that found in OP. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that lipids may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of OA and may provide part of the key to understanding why OA and OP lie at opposite ends of the spectrum of bone masses.},

Useful clinical utility of these measures is necessary to support diagnostic imaging and subsequent surgical decision-making. OBJECTIVE: Summarise/evaluate the current diagnostic accuracy of various clinical tests germane to hip FAI/ALT pathology. METHODS: A computer-assisted literature search of MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE databases using keywords related to diagnostic accuracy of the hip joint, as well as the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the search and reporting phases of the study. Quality assessment of bias and applicability was conducted using the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Random effects models were used to summarise sensitivities (SN), specificities (SP), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and respective confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The employed search strategy revealed 21 potential articles, with one demonstrating high quality. Nine articles qualified for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated that flexion-adduction-internal rotation (pooled SN ranging from 0.94 (95\% CI 0.90 to 0.97) to 0.99 (95\% CI 0.98 to 1.00); DOR 5.71 (95\% CI 0.84 to 38.86) to 7.82 (95\% CI 1.06 to 57.84)) and flexion-internal rotation (pooled SN 0.96 (95\% CI 0.81 to 0.99); DOR 8.36 (95\% CI 0.41 to 171.3) tests possess only screening accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Few hip physical examination tests for diagnosing FAI/ALT have been investigated in enough studies of substantial quality to direct clinical decision-making. Further high-quality studies across a wider spectrum of hip pathology patients are recommended to discern the confirmed clinical utility of these tests.

  abstract = {In conclusion, instability as a cause of shoulder pain in the young athlete is a difficult and often missed diagnosis. These young patients often seek treatment of shoulder pain but do not recall any episodes of shoulder instability. As a result, these uncommon, poorly described forms of instability are often misdiagnosed. A heightened clinical suspicion and an accurate, prompt diagnosis of instability is of paramount importance in this athletic group. It dictates appropriate treatment of the condition, avoids treatment delays and failure, provides better outcomes, and ensures timely return to play. UPS and MDI are two forms of this diagnosis. In UPS, patients at risk are young hyperlax athletes with a history of direct trauma or forceful overextension of the shoulder. They have shoulder pain that is described as deep anterior, reproduced with an anterior apprehension test and relieved with a relocation test. Soft tissue and/or bony lesions consistent with instability (observed on imaging or at arthroscopy) are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of UPS. Once the diagnosis is made, standard arthroscopic techniques with labrum reinsertion and/or anteroinferior capsule plication can lead to predictable good results and return to sport. In MDI, patients at risk are also young hyperlax athletes. However, these patients often do not have a history of trauma. They have shoulder pain that is often somewhat vague in location and is reproduced with a sulcus and/or hyper abduction test. Soft tissue and/or bony lesions consistent with instability are uncommon, with the exception of capsular laxity. The mainstay of treatment is physiotherapy rehabilitation. When surgery is necessary, open capsular shift and arthroscopic capsular plication are effective.},

Background The number of arthroscopic surgical procedures for patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) has significantly increased worldwide, but high-quality evidence of the effect of such interventions is lacking. Objectives The primary objective will be to determine the efficacy of hip arthroscopic procedures compared to sham surgery on patient-reported outcomes for patients with FAIS (HIP ARThroscopy International [HIPARTI] Study). The secondary objective will be to evaluate prognostic factors for long-term outcome after arthroscopic surgical interventions in patients with FAIS (Hip ARthroscopy Prospective [HARP] Study). Methods The HIPARTI Study will include 140 patients and the HARP Study will include 100 patients. The international Hip Outcome Tool-33 will be the primary outcome measure at 1 year. Secondary outcome measures will be the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale, fear of movement (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia), Patient-Specific Functional Scale, global rating of change score, and expectations. Other outcomes will include active hip range of motion, hip muscle strength tests, functional performance tests, as well as radiological assessments using radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusion To determine the true effect of surgery, beyond that of placebo, double-blinded placebo-controlled trials including sham surgery are needed. The HIPARTI Study will direct future evidence-based treatment of FAIS. Predictors for long-term development and progression of degenerative changes in the hip are also needed for this young patient group with FAIS; hence, responders and nonresponders to treatment could be determined.

  abstract = {Degeneration of the intervertebral discs (IVDs) is a major contributor to back, neck and radicular pain. IVD degeneration is characterized by increases in levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6 and IL-17 secreted by the IVD cells; these cytokines promote extracellular matrix degradation, chemokine production and changes in IVD cell phenotype. The resulting imbalance in catabolic and anabolic responses leads to the degeneration of IVD tissues, as well as disc herniation and radicular pain. The release of chemokines from degenerating discs promotes the infiltration and activation of immune cells, further amplifying the inflammatory cascade. Leukocyte migration into the IVD is accompanied by the appearance of microvasculature tissue and nerve fibres. Furthermore, neurogenic factors, generated by both disc and immune cells, induce expression of pain-associated cation channels in the dorsal root ganglion. Depolarization of these ion channels is likely to promote discogenic and radicular pain, and reinforce the cytokine-mediated degenerative cascade. Taken together, an enhanced understanding of the contribution of cytokines and immune cells to these catabolic, angiogenic and nociceptive processes could provide new targets for the treatment of symptomatic disc disease. In this Review, the role of key inflammatory cytokines during each of the individual phases of degenerative disc disease, as well as the outcomes of major clinical studies aimed at blocking cytokine function, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a motion-related pathology of the hip characterized by pain, morphological abnormalities of the proximal femur, and an elevated risk of joint deterioration and hip osteoarthritis. Activities that require deep flexion are understood to induce impingement in cam FAIS patients, however, less demanding activities such as walking and pivoting may induce pain as well as alterations in kinematics and joint stability. Still, the paucity of quantitative descriptions of cam FAIS has hindered understanding underlying hip joint mechanics during such activities. Previous in silico studies have employed generalized model geometry or kinematics to simulate impingement between the femur and acetabulum, which may not accurately capture the interplay between morphology and motion. In this study, we utilized models with participant-specific bone and articular soft tissue anatomy and kinematics measured by dual-fluoroscopy to compare hip contact mechanics of cam FAIS patients to controls during four activities of daily living (internal/external pivoting and level/incline walking). Averaged across the gait cycle during incline walking, patients displayed increased strain in the anterior joint (labrum strain: p-value~=~0.038, patients: 11.7~{\textpm}~6.7~\%, controls: 5.0~{\textpm}~3.6~\%; cartilage strain: p-value~=~0.029, patients: 9.1~{\textpm}~3.3~\%, controls: 4.2~{\textpm}~2.3). Patients also exhibited increased average anterior cartilage strains during external pivoting (p-value~=~0.039; patients: 13.0~{\textpm}~9.2~\%, controls: 3.9~{\textpm}~3.2~\%]). No significant differences between patient and control contact area and strain were found for level walking and internal pivoting. Our study provides new insights into the biomechanics of cam FAIS, including spatiotemporal hip joint contact mechanics during activities of daily living.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lumbar spine pathology (LSP) is a common source of low back or leg pain, and paraspinal muscle in these patients demonstrates fatty and fibrotic infiltration, and cellular degeneration that do not reverse with exercise-based rehabilitation. However, it is unclear of this lack of response is due to insufficient exercise stimulus, or an inability to mount a growth response. The purpose of this study was to compare paraspinal muscle gene expression between individuals with LSP who do and do not undergo an acute bout of resistance exercise. METHODS: Paraspinal muscle biopsies were obtained from 64 individuals with LSP undergoing spinal surgery. Eight participants performed an acute bout of machine-based lumbar extension resistance exercise preoperatively. Gene expression for 42 genes associated with adipogenic/metabolic, atrophic, fibrogenic, inflammatory, and myogenic pathways was measured, and differential expression between exercised and non-exercised groups was evaluated for (a) the full cohort, and (b) an age, gender, acuity, and etiology matched sub-cohort. Principal components analyses were used to identify gene expression clustering across clinical phenotypes. RESULTS: The exercised cohort demonstrated upregulation of inflammatory gene IL1B, inhibition of extracellular matrix components (increased MMP3\&9, decreased TIMP1\&3, COL1A1) and metabolic/adipogenic genes (FABP4, PPARD, WNT10B), and downregulation of myogenic (MYOD, ANKRD2B) and atrophic (FOXO3) genes compared to the non-exercised cohort, with similar patterns in the matched sub-analysis. There were no clinical phenotypes significantly associated with gene expression profiles. CONCLUSION: An acute bout of moderate-high intensity resistance exercise did not result in upregulation of myogenic genes in individuals with LSP. The response was characterized by mixed metabolic and fibrotic gene expression, upregulation of inflammation, and downregulation of myogenesis.},

Rehabilitation aims to regain symmetrical knee strength and function to minimize the risk of a second ACL injury after RTS. PURPOSE: To determine the effect of absolute quadriceps and hamstring strength, normalized by body weight, on the risk of a second ACL injury during the first 2 years after RTS in patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction (ACLR). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Data from patients after index ACLR at the time of RTS were extracted from a rehabilitation registry-Project ACL. Patients who had performed isokinetic tests for quadriceps and hamstring strength and hop tests before RTS were included. The endpoint was a second ACL injury or a follow-up of 2 years after RTS after ACLR. RESULTS: A total of 835 patients (46\% women), with a mean age of 23.9 {\textpm} 7.7 years, were included. During the study period, 69 (8.3\%) second ACL injuries (ipsilateral and contralateral) occurred. Greater relative quadriceps strength in the injured leg increased the risk of a second ACL injury (relative risk [RR], 1.69 [95\% CI, 1.05-2.74]; P = .032). In patients who had recovered symmetrical quadriceps strength (limb symmetry index {$\geq$}90\%), there was no effect of quadriceps strength on the risk of second ACL injury (RR, 1.33 [95\% CI, 0.69-2.56]; P = .39). Quadriceps strength on the healthy side or hamstring strength, regardless of side, had no effect on the risk of a second ACL injury. CONCLUSION: Greater relative quadriceps strength in the injured leg at the time of RTS after ACLR was associated with an increased risk of a second ACL injury. There was no effect of relative quadriceps strength on the risk of a second ACL injury in patients who had recovered symmetrical quadriceps strength.},

Thus, it is essential to comprehend IVDD's pathophysiology. Numerous factors, such as inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, apoptosis, matrix metalloproteinases, are linked to IVDD pathogenesis. Despite the fact that many researches has provided explanations for the pathophysiology of IVDD, these studies are typically singular, restricted, and isolated, expound only on one or two components, and do not systematically analyze and summarize the numerous influencing elements. In addition, we discovered that the incidence of many chronic diseases in the field of orthopedics may be thoroughly and systematically defined in terms of immunological systems. In order to provide a theoretical foundation for an in-depth understanding of the pathological process of IVDD and the formulation of more effective prevention and treatment measures, this review provides a comprehensive and systematic account of the pathogenesis of IVDD from the physical to the molecular barriers of the intervertebral disc, from the nucleus pulposus tissue to the cellular to the immune-molecular level.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the effectiveness of two home-based exercise programs for treating multidirectional shoulder instability (MDI) in patients diagnosed with Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) or Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders (HSD). METHODS: Twenty-one hEDS/HSD patients with MDI were recruited from the Center for Medical Genetics of the Ghent University Hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group. Both groups received a 6-month home-based exercise program. The primary outcome measure was the Western Ontario Shoulder Index (WOSI). Secondary outcomes included the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), Global Rating of Change (GROC), and pain pressure thresholds. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 6\,weeks, 12\,weeks, and 24\,weeks. RESULTS: Significant main effects for time were observed for all questionnaires, except for the TSK (p\,=\,0.12). Patients improved 240 and 325 points on the WOSI after 12 (p\,=\,0.02) and 24\,weeks (p\,=\,0.001), respectively. Additionally, patients improved 8.6 points on the DASH (p\,=\,0.002), 4.3 points on the PSFS (p\,=\,0.01), and 1.02 points on the GROC (p\,=\,0.001) after 24\,weeks. CONCLUSION: No significant differences were found between group A and B. Both home-based exercise programs led to significant improvements in shoulder function. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONHome-based exercise therapy may be effective for treating MDI in the hEDS/HSD population.Home-based training is beneficial for improving shoulder function, but a multidisciplinary, supervised approach might be more effective for altering kinesiophobia in this patient population.},

  abstract = {Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder involving~a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Progressive muscle weakness, most notably of the proximal lower limbs, is the primary manifestation of this condition.~The onset of BMD symptoms varies widely between 5 and 60 years. In a study involving 67 individuals with BMD, most were found ambulant until their 40s or older, while a small group experienced earlier loss of ambulation.~BMD symptoms usually~appear at a later age~than~a similar X-linked disorder, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD and BMD may be easier to distinguish based on~the age at which patients become wheelchair-dependent. Patients with DMD are wheelchair-dependent before age 13, while individuals with BMD may remain ambulatory even after age 16.~Patients presenting with proximal muscle weakness before turning 12 may be hard to diagnose without genetic analysis. BMD is currently considered a mild form of DMD rather than a distinct clinical entity. Consequently, interventional trials are more rarely conducted for BMD than DMD. Skeletal muscle fibers (myocytes) arise from the fusion of contiguous embryonic muscle cells and are thus multinucleated. Multiple nuclei may be found close to the intracytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane (sarcolemma). Myocytes have abundant microfilaments, which give rise to the contractile apparatus of the myofibrils. The repeating units of myofibrils are the sarcomeres, composed of interlaced actin and myosin filaments and perpendicularly oriented Z-bands.~The T-tubule system is a sarcolemmal invagination into the~myocyte involved in calcium storage and release during contraction. The sarcoplasm (myocyte cytoplasm) contains myoglobin, glycogen, creatine, creatine kinase (CK), lysosomes,~mitochondria, and lipid vacuoles.~ Actin binds to the subsarcolemmal cytoskeletal protein dystrophin,~which interfaces with~the extracellular matrix through transmembrane dystrophin-associated proteins. Dystrophin normally provides mechanical reinforcement, stabilizing the cell membrane.~Dystrophin abnormality is the leading cause of BMD.},

Since diet may potentially affect OA, we reviewed the literature on the relationship between nutrition and OA risk or progression, aiming to provide guidance for clinicians. For overweight/obese patients, weight reduction, ideally incorporating exercise, is paramount. The association between metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes and OA risk or progression may partly explain the apparent benefit of dietary-lipid modification resulting from increased consumption of long-chain omega-3 fatty-acids from oily fish/fish oil supplements. A strong association between OA and raised serum cholesterol together with clinical effects in statin users suggests a potential benefit of reduction of cholesterol by dietary means. Patients should ensure that they meet the recommended intakes for micronutrients such as vitamin K, which has a role in bone/cartilage mineralization. Evidence for a role of vitamin D supplementation in OA is unconvincing.},

However, its reliability was tested only in recreational athletes' males and there are no studies comparing scores between sedentary and active samples. The purpose was to examine inter and intrasession reliability of CKCUES Test for samples of sedentary male and female with (SIS), for samples of sedentary healthy male and female, and for male and female samples of healthy upper extremity sport specific recreational athletes. Other purpose was to compare scores within sedentary and within recreational athletes samples of same gender. METHODS: A sample of 108 subjects with and without SIS was recruited. Subjects were tested twice, seven days apart. Each subject performed four test repetitions, with 45 seconds of rest between them. The last three repetitions were averaged and used to statistical analysis. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient ICC2,1 was used to assess intrasession reliability of number of touches score and ICC2,3 was used to assess intersession reliability of number of touches, normalized score, and power score. Test scores within groups of same gender also were compared. Measurement error was determined by calculating the Standard Error of the Measurement (SEM) and Minimum detectable change (MDC) for all scores. RESULTS: The CKCUES Test showed excellent intersession reliability for scores in all samples. Results also showed excellent intrasession reliability of number of touches for all samples. Scores were greater in active compared to sedentary, with exception of power score. All scores were greater in active compared to sedentary and SIS males and females. SEM ranged from 1.45 to 2.76 touches (based on a 95\% CI) and MDC ranged from 2.05 to 3.91(based on a 95\% CI) in subjects with and without SIS. At least three touches are needed to be considered a real improvement on CKCUES Test scores. CONCLUSION: Results suggest CKCUES Test is a reliable tool to evaluate upper extremity functional performance for sedentary, for upper extremity sport specific recreational, and for sedentary males and females with SIS.},

DATA SOURCES: Nine electronic databases searched from inception to March 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials comparing exercise interventions with each other or with no exercise control for adults with knee or hip osteoarthritis. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers evaluated eligibility and methodological quality. Main outcomes extracted were pain intensity and limitation of function. Trial sequential analysis was used to investigate reliability and conclusiveness of available evidence for exercise interventions. Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to combine both direct (within trial) and indirect (between trial) evidence on treatment effectiveness. RESULTS: 60 trials (44 knee, two hip, 14 mixed) covering 12 exercise interventions and with 8218 patients met inclusion criteria. Sequential analysis showed that as of 2002 sufficient evidence had been accrued to show significant benefit of exercise interventions over no exercise control. For pain relief, strengthening, flexibility plus strengthening, flexibility plus strengthening plus aerobic, aquatic strengthening, and aquatic strengthening plus flexibility, exercises were significantly more effective than no exercise control. A combined intervention of strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic exercise was also significantly more effective than no exercise control for improving limitation in function (standardised mean difference -0.63, 95\% credible interval -1.16 to -0.10). CONCLUSIONS: As of 2002 sufficient evidence had accumulated to show significant benefit of exercise over no exercise in patients with osteoarthritis, and further trials are unlikely to overturn this result. An approach combining exercises to increase strength, flexibility, and aerobic capacity is likely to be most effective in the management of lower limb osteoarthritis. The evidence is largely from trials in patients with knee osteoarthritis. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) No CRD42012002267.},

Patients with trunk trauma suffer blood loss, inflammation and hypoxia and are at risk of developing respiratory and musculoskeletal complications during their recovery. Physiotherapists are an integral part of the interprofessional team that manages patients who sustain trunk trauma. OBJECTIVES: To describe the physiotherapy management of adult patients with trunk trauma, their quality of life, post-discharge rehabilitation service provision, and outcome measures used in the physiotherapy management. METHOD: A non-systematic narrative review of published literature was performed. RESULTS: Mobilisation, functional exercises, deep breathing exercises and active coughing are used to optimise patients' respiratory and musculoskeletal functioning. Some physiotherapists educate patients on the use of pain management strategies to reduce discomfort from rib fractures, surgical sites and intercostal drainage bottle tubing. Survivors of trunk trauma experience limitations in physical function up to two years. Little is known about post-discharge rehabilitation service provision to these patients after discharge. Few physiotherapists use outcome measures as part of their daily clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Physiotherapy management of patients with blunt or penetrating trunk trauma during hospitalisation and after discharge is a field of clinical practice that is rich for high-quality research related to service provision, cost analysis and interventions used. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Physiotherapy clinicians and researchers can use the findings of this review as a guide to their management of adult patients recovering from trunk trauma.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most commonly recommended treatment for multidirectional instability (MDI) of the glenohumeral joint is exercise-based management. The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise-based management in patients with MDI. The secondary aim was to observe the types of exercise protocols and outcomes used, as well as any adverse results associated with exercise. METHODS: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Medline, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PEDro, Current Contents, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), Australasian Medical Index (AMI), Ausport, and Clinical Trials Registers were searched for published and unpublished studies from the inception date to June 2012 using the keywords multidirectional instability, glenohumeral, and exercise. Selection criteria included all study designs (except case reports and case series) and participants with clinically diagnosed MDI using exercise-based management. Inclusion criteria were not limited by outcomes. The authors' own risk-of-bias tool was used for quality assessment of studies. The GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to synthesize the evidence. RESULTS: The risk of bias was high in all 7 included studies. For before-and-after comparisons of exercise-based management, GRADE assessment showed very low-quality evidence for improvements in shoulder kinematics, the Rowe score, overall status rating, and peak muscle strength. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of exercise-based management on MDI was variable across the included studies because of study heterogeneity and a high level of bias.

  abstract = {Study Design Prospective cohort. Background The high risk of second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries after return to sport highlights the importance of return-to-sport decision making. Objective return-to-sport criteria frequently use limb symmetry indexes (LSIs) to quantify quadriceps strength and hop scores. Whether using the uninvolved limb in LSIs is optimal is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the uninvolved limb as a reference standard for LSIs utilized in return-to-sport testing and its relationship with second ACL injury rates. Methods Seventy athletes completed quadriceps strength and 4 single-leg hop tests before anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and 6 months after ACLR. Limb symmetry indexes for each test compared involved-limb measures at 6 months to uninvolved-limb measures at 6 months. Estimated preinjury capacity (EPIC) levels for each test compared involved-limb measures at 6 months to uninvolved-limb measures before ACLR. Second ACL injuries were tracked for a minimum follow-up of 2 years after ACLR. Results Forty (57.1\%) patients achieved 90\% LSIs for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. Only 20 (28.6\%) patients met 90\% EPIC levels (comparing the involved limb at 6 months after ACLR to the uninvolved limb before ACLR) for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. Twenty-four (34.3\%) patients who achieved 90\% LSIs for all measures 6 months after ACLR did not achieve 90\% EPIC levels for all measures. Estimated preinjury capacity levels were more sensitive than LSIs in predicting second ACL injuries (LSIs, 0.273; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.010, 0.566 and EPIC, 0.818; 95\% CI: 0.523, 0.949). Conclusion Limb symmetry indexes frequently overestimate knee function after ACLR and may be related to second ACL injury risk. These findings raise concern about whether the variable ACL return-to-sport criteria utilized in current clinical practice are stringent enough to achieve safe and successful return to sport.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Shoulder instability is extremely common, with various outcome scores used to assess its progression after treatment. This review was performed to identify the scores most commonly used and to evaluate them according to the 4 core domains of shoulder trials (according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [COMET] initiative) and their respective psychometric qualities. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature of 3 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed) was undertaken. Studies were identified using eligibility criteria and critically appraised by 2 authors. Data were extracted using an a priori template. Outcome scores were identified and assessed regarding COMET domain inclusion and their psychometric properties. RESULTS: The most frequently used scores were the Rowe (58\%), Constant (33\%), Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI; 24\%), and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (23\%) scores. The majority of outcome scores assessed pain and all assessed physical functioning. Quality of life and a global assessment of treatment success were rarely incorporated. No single outcome score considered all core COMET domains. The WOSI was the most acceptable measure of those assessed with respect to its validity, reliability, and responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The WOSI incorporated 3 of the 4 core domains for shoulder trials (pain, physical functioning, and health-related quality of life). It had the most psychometric testing of the identified scores, confirming its reliability, validity, and responsiveness in the setting of shoulder instability. We recommend its use in this setting; however, it should be supplemented with additional outcome scores, such as the University of California-Los Angeles score, to cover all of the core COMET domains.},

  abstract = {The incidence of knee injuries in sport, particularly involving the ACL, appears to be increasing yearly, especially in younger age athletes. Even more concerning is the frequency of ACL reinjury also appears to be increasing year after year. Improving the objective criteria and testing methods used to determine return to play (RTP) readiness following ACL surgery is one aspect of the rehabilitation process that can significantly help in reducing reinjury rates. Currently, the majority of clinicians are still using post operative time frames as their number one criterion for clearance to RTP. This flawed method demonstrates an inadequate reflection of the true unpredictable, dynamic environment athletes are returning to participate in. In our clinical experience, objective testing to allow for clearance to sport participation following an ACL injury should incorporate neurocognitive and reactive testing due to the nature of the injury typically occurs because of failed control of unanticipated reactive movements. The purpose of this manuscript is to share a neurocognitive testing sequence we currently employ consisting of 8 tests in 3 categories: Blazepod tests, reactive shuttle run tests, and reactive hop tests. The use of a more dynamic reactive testing battery may decrease the reinjury rates when an athlete is cleared for participation by measuring readiness in chaotic circumstances that are more truly reflective of the sporting environment the athlete is working to return to and in the process give them a greater sense of confidence.},

While traditional rehabilitation emphasizes the restoration of motion, strength, and physical performance, emerging research highlights the importance of addressing neurocognitive deficits that can persist after injury. These deficits, including altered proprioception, impaired motor control and muscle recruitment, as well as heightened reliance on visual feedback, can significantly increase the risk of re-injury and impede return to sport. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to outline a proposed comprehensive approach to rehabilitation that challenges the neurocognitive system to optimize rehabilitation outcomes and reduce reinjury risk. Thus, this clinical commentary discusses the rationale for integrating neurocognitive training into all phases of ACLR rehabilitation, from initial injury to eight weeks post-surgery. It details the neurophysiological changes caused by ACL injury and presents evidence supporting the use of exercises that challenge visual attention, decision-making, and motor planning. A comprehensive rehabilitation framework incorporating both physical and neurocognitive components is proposed, aiming to improve long-term outcomes and reduce re-injury risk. Level of Evidence: 5.},

Disruption of this interplay or poor development of any of these factors may result in instability, pain, and a loss of function. Rehabilitation will vary based on the type of instability present and the key principles described. Whether a course of nonoperative rehabilitation is followed or the patient presents postoperatively, a comprehensive program designed to establish full ROM and balance capsular mobility, in addition to maximizing muscular strength, endurance, proprioception, dynamic stability, and neuromuscular control is essential. A functional approach to rehabilitation using movement patterns and sport-specific positions along with an interval sport program will allow a gradual return to athletics. The focus of the program should minimize the risk of recurrence and ensure that the patient can safely return to functional activities.},

The large majority of these injuries do not require surgical intervention. CASE SUBJECT DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old professional wrestling athlete presented to the clinic with acute complaints of right medial knee pain resulting from a traumatic valgus force. Physical exam revealed Grade 3 MCL injury. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed clinical diagnosis of a Grade 3 proximal MCL tear. This athlete had sustained a prior grade 3 ACL injury with Grade 3 distal MCL injury which required surgery to reconstruct the ACL and repair the MCL 13 months prior, in November of 2015. OUTCOMES: The subject was successfully treated with a series of three sequential Leukocyte Rich Platelet Rich Plasma (LR-PRP) Injections spaced evenly one week apart in addition to an early physical therapy regimen. The total treatment time was cut down from an expected 35-49 days to 31 days. DISCUSSION: When paired with the appropriate rehabilitation treatment progression, the use of LR-PRP injections in the treatment of an isolated MCL tear was beneficial for this subject. CONCLUSION: The results of this case report indicate that the use of LR-PRP and early rehabilitation shows promise in treating an acute grade 3 MCL injury. Future research utilizing randomized controlled trials are needed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case Report, 4.},

  abstract = {Spine Anatomy Collectively, the spine has an anterior and a posterior region (see Image. Lumbar Vertebral Anatomy). The cylindrical vertebral bodies comprise the anterior spine, separated by intervertebral (IV) disks and held in place by the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments. The IV disks have the gelatinous nucleus pulposus in the middle, surrounded by the cartilaginous annulus fibrosus (see Image. Intervertebral Disk). The cervical and lumbar spinal segments have the largest IV disks, owing to these regions' mobility. The anterior spine is a shock absorber of bodily movements. The vertebral arches and processes constitute the posterior spine. Each vertebral arch has an anterior pair of cylindrical pedicles and a posterior pair of laminae (see Image. Lumbar Vertebra, Superoposterior View). Other structures emanating from the vertebral arch include 2 lateral transverse processes, 1 posterior process, and 2 superior and 2 inferior articular facets. Facet joints form from superior and inferior facet apposition. The spinal canal, which houses the spinal cord, is formed by the vertebral bodies and IV disks anteriorly and vertebral arches posteriorly. The nerve roots exit superior to their corresponding vertebral body through the intervertebral canal. The ligamentum flavum (yellow ligament) is a thick, fibrous structure passing between adjacent laminae. The lateral recess is an anatomic space in the posterior spine bounded anteriorly by the vertebral body and disk, posteriorly by the ligamentum flavum and vertebral arch, laterally by the pedicle, and medially by the thecal sac. This region is narrow and is a potential area of nerve root compression. The posterior spine has various functions, including spinal cord and nerve root protection and muscle and ligament support.~~ Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is the narrowing of the lumbar vertebra in the central canal, lateral recess, or neural foraminal areas.~Central canal stenosis may compress the thecal sac and bilateral spinal segments and thus, in the severe form, may produce bilateral symptoms. Lateral recess and neural foraminal stenosis may compress the nerve roots and produce unilateral lumbar radiculopathy symptoms.~ Central stenosis arises from anterior ligamentum flavum hypertrophy compounded by posterior disk bulging. This condition is more prevalent at the L4 to L5 level than other spinal segments. Meanwhile, lateral recess stenosis results from facet arthropathy and osteophyte formation, compressing the nerve before it passes the intervertebral foramen. Foraminal stenosis is due to disk height loss, foraminal disk protrusion, or osteophyte formation. These changes impinge on the nerve root inside the intervertebral foramen. Extraforaminal stenosis is usually due to far lateral disk herniation. This condition compresses the nerve root after exiting the intervertebral foramen laterally.~ LSS is a significant cause of disability in older individuals and a common spinal surgery indication in patients older than 65 years.~Henk Verbiest first described relative and absolute spinal stenosis as lumbar canal midsagittal diameter of less than 12 mm and 10 mm, respectively. However, LSS clinical and radiologic diagnostic criteria have not been established despite this condition's global prevalence. Thus, this clinical entity has no universally accepted definition.},

This study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of SedSign in differential diagnosis of LSS and non-specific low back pain (LBP) in consecutive patients. METHODS: A series of consecutive patients with lumbar spinal MRI examination for back/leg pain in orthopeadic clinic were included. These patients were followed up and divided into two groups, symptomatic LSS and non-specific LBP, according to symptoms and radiological findings. Using MR images, SedSign was assessed by two spine surgeons and one radiologist independently. Then sensitivity and specificity of SedSign was calculated. RESULT: A total of 320 patients (105 LSS and 215 non-specific LBP) were included. The SedSign had a sensitivity of 77.1~\% and specificity of 47.0~\% in the whole cohort. When these patients were stratified by dural sac cross-sectional areas (CSA), the SedSign had a sensitivity of 95.0~\% and specificity of 4.7~\% in patients with CSA~{$\leq~$}80~mm2 (severe radiologic stenosis), sensitivity of 74.2~\% and specificity of 22.6~\% in patients with CSA 80-100~mm2 (moderate radiologic stenosis), and sensitivity of 58.8~\% and specificity of 61.0~\% in patients with CSA 100-120~mm2 (mild radiologic stenosis). In selected cases composed by LSS patients with CSA~{$\leq~$}80~mm2 and non-specific LBP patients with CSA~{$>~$}120~mm2, however, the SedSign had a sensitivity of 95.0~\% and specificity of 80.0~\%. CONCLUSION: The present data demonstrated that the SedSign was not able to discriminate symptomatic LSS from non-specific LBP after adjusting by dural sac CSA. The diagnostic value of the SedSign was still uncertain.},
