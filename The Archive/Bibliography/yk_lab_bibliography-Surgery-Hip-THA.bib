  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orthostatic intolerance (OI)-type events following hip and knee arthroplasty increase the risk of falls, hospital length of stay, and health-care costs. There is a limited understanding of the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events in patients during the acute hospital stay. Our aim was to systematically review the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events during the acute hospital stay following hip and knee arthroplasty. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that investigated the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events was undertaken. A comprehensive search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL from their inception to October 2021. The methodological quality of identified studies was assessed using the modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (14,055 patients) were included. The incidence was 2\% to 52\% for an OI event, 1\% to 46\% for orthostatic hypotension, and 0\% to 18\% for syncope/vasovagal events. Two studies reported female sex, high peak pain levels ({$>$}5 out of 10) during mobilization, postoperative use of gabapentin, and the absence of postoperative intravenous dexamethasone as risk factors. There was no consensus on the definition and assessment of an OI-type event. CONCLUSIONS: OI-type events are common during the acute hospital stay following hip and knee arthroplasty, and 4 risk factors have been reported for OI-type events. High-quality prospective cohort studies are required to systematically and reliably determine the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level IV.

This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with persistent pain after total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) surgeries. To meet the inclusion criteria, studies were required to assess variables before or at the time of surgery, include a persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) outcome measure at least 2 months after a TKR or THR surgery, and include a statistical analysis of the effect of the risk factor(s) on the outcome measure. Outcomes from studies implementing univariate and multivariable statistical models were analyzed separately. Where possible, data from univariate analyses on the same factors were combined in a meta-analysis. Eighty-one studies involving 171,354 patients were included in the review. Because of the heterogeneity of assessment methods, only 44\% of the studies allowed meaningful meta-analysis. In meta-analyses, state anxiety (but not trait anxiety) scores and higher depression scores on the Beck Depression Inventory were associated with an increased risk of PPSP after TKR. In the qualitative summary of multivariable analyses, higher preoperative pain scores were associated with PPSP after TKR or THR. This review systematically assessed factors associated with an increased risk of PPSP after TKR and THR and highlights current knowledge gaps that can be addressed by future research.},

The objectives of this study were (1) to identify our institution's most common causes for failed SDD, and (2) to evaluate risk factors associated with failed SDD. METHODS: A retrospective review of SDD patients undergoing primary TKA or THA from January 2021 to September 2022 was conducted. Reasons for SDD failure were recorded and differences between successful and failed SDD cases were assessed via a multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 85.3\% (651 of 753) of patients included were successful SDDs. Failed SDD occurred in 16.8\% (74 of 441) of TKA and 11.8\% (38 of 322) of THA cases. Primary reasons included failure to clear physical therapy (33.0\%, 37 of 112), postoperative hypotension (20.5\%, 23 of 112), and urinary retention (16.9\%, 19 of 112). Analysis revealed that overall failed SDD cases were more likely to have had prior opioid use and a longer surgical time. Failed TKA SDD cases were more likely to have had a longer surgical time and not have receive a preoperative nerve block, while failed THA SDD cases were more likely to be older. CONCLUSIONS: The SDD selection criteria and pathways continue to evolve, with multiple factors contributing to failed SDD. Improving patient selection algorithms and optimizing post-operative pathways can enhance the ability to successfully choose SDD candidates. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early postoperative mobilization is a cornerstone in fast-track total hip arthroplasty (THA), but postoperative orthostatic intolerance (OI) may delay early recovery or lead to fainting, falls, and prosthesis dislocation or fracture. However, the prevalence and pathophysiology of OI has not been established after THA. This study evaluated the cardiovascular response and tissue oxygenation to mobilization before and after surgery in relation to OI in fast-track THA patients. METHODS: OI and the cardiovascular response to standing were evaluated with a standardized mobilization protocol, before, 6, and 24 h after surgery in 26 patients undergoing THA with spinal anaesthesia and an opioid-sparing analgesic regime. Haemoglobin, fluid balance, and opioid use were recorded. Systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance were measured non-invasively (Nexfin({\textregistered})) and cerebral ( ) and muscle tissue oxygenation by non-infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: No patients demonstrated OI before surgery, whereas 11 (42\%) and five (19\%) patients experienced OI 6 and 24 h after surgery, respectively. OI was associated with decreased orthostatic responses in SAP, DAP, SV, CO, and compared with orthostatic tolerant patients (P{$<$}0.05). There was no difference in postoperative haemoglobin concentrations or opioid use between orthostatic intolerant and tolerant patients. CONCLUSIONS: Early postoperative OI is common in patients undergoing THA and is associated with an impaired cardiovascular orthostatic response and decreased cerebral oxygenation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative orthostatic intolerance can limit mobilization after hip and knee arthroplasty. The literature is lacking on the incidence and risk factors associated with orthostatic intolerance after elective arthroplasty. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study of primary total hip, total knee, and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty patients was conducted. Patients with orthostatic events were identified, and potential demographic and perioperative risk factors were recorded. Orthostatic intolerance was defined as postoperative syncope, lightheadedness, or dizziness, limiting ambulation and/or requiring medical treatment. Statistical analysis was completed using Pearson's chi-square test for categorical data and t-tests for continuous data. Binary logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: A total of 500 consecutive patients were included. The overall incidence of orthostatic intolerance was 18\%; 25\% in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 11\% in total knee arthroplasty. On univariate analysis, significant risk factors for developing postoperative orthostatic intolerance include older age, female gender, THA surgery, lower American Society of Anesthesiologists class, absence of recreational drug use, lower estimated blood volume, lower preoperative diastolic blood pressure, spinal with monitored anesthesia care (MAC), posterior approach for THA, bupivacaine use in spinal, percent of blood loss, postoperative oxycodone or tramadol use, higher postoperative intravenous fluid volume, and lower postoperative hemoglobin. Multivariate analysis demonstrated persistent significance of female gender, THA surgery, spinal with MAC, bupivacaine use in spinal, and more intravenous fluid administered postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Orthostatic intolerance affects a significant number of arthroplasty patients. Awareness of risk factors and modification of perioperative variables linked to orthostatic intolerance may assist the surgeon in choosing the appropriate surgical setting, educating patients, and improving early postoperative recovery.},

We aimed to study postoperative changes in vascular tone and their potential association with OI in various orthopedic surgical settings. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 350 patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty under neuraxial anesthesia or spine surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. We determined the augmentation index (AI) as a measure of vascular tone and studied symptoms of OI using a validated questionnaire at various postoperative time points. RESULTS: The AI was significantly reduced postoperatively (at spinal resolution in patients with neuraxial anesthesia or two hours postoperatively in general anesthesia) compared with baseline values in all procedures and did not subsequently return to baseline throughout the postoperative period in the majority of patients [252/335 (75.2\%); P {$<$} 0.001]. The majority [260/342 (76.0\%); P {$<$} 0.001] of patients had postoperative symptoms of OI. Nevertheless, no association was found between postoperative change in AI from baseline and postoperative symptoms of OI. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly prolonged decrease in AI and symptoms of OI are common after orthopedic surgery. Nevertheless, an association between the two measures was not observed. While compensatory mechanisms may limit the influence of an AI decrease on symptoms of OI, more research is needed to understand the contributing factors and aid in the identification of patients at risk of OI.},

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, risk factors and outcome of this complication within one large surgical practice. METHODS: We analysed the records of 10,624 primary THAs carried out between January 1993 and November 2017 using a posterior approach. All were under the care of the senior author. RESULTS: Overall, there were 47 cases (0.44\%) of foot drop, but over time the incidence dropped from 0.6\% to 0.3\% (p = 0.033). Preoperative protrusio acetabulae (p {$<$} 0.001), female sex (p {$<$} 0.001) and junior grade of surgeon (p {$<$} 0.009) were all significant risk factors. In this series, dysplasia was not a risk factor. 1\,year postoperatively, 25 (53.2\%) had complete recovery, 12 (25.5\%) had ongoing sensory deficit but normal power, and 10 (21.3\%) had a residual sensory-motor deficit. CONCLUSION: Take home message:- In this series, protrusio acetabulae, female sex and junior grade of surgeon were significant risk factors for foot drop following primary THA.},

The purpose of the study is to identify the causes for failed same-day discharge (SDD) and perioperative factors leading to failed SDD. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study followed pre-selected patients for SDD THA from 1 August 2018 to 31 December 2020. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing unilateral THA with appropriate social support, age 18 to 75 years, and BMI {$<$} 37 kg/m2. Patients with opioid dependence, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease were excluded. Demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative data were collected from the electronic medical records. Possible risk factors for failed SDD were identified using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In all, 278 patients were identified with a mean age of 57.1 years (SD 8.1) and a mean BMI of 27.3 kg/m2 (SD 4.5). A total of 96 patients failed SDD, with the most common reasons being failure to clear physical therapy (26\%), dizziness (22\%), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (11\%). Risk factors associated with failed SDD included smokers (odds ratio (OR) 6.24; p = 0.009), a maximum postoperative pain score {$>$} 8 (OR 4.76; p = 0.004), and procedures starting after 11 am (OR 2.28; p = 0.015). A higher postoperative tolerable pain goal (numerical rating scale 4 to 10) was found to be associated with successful SDD (OR 2.7; p = 0.001). Age, BMI, surgical approach, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, and anaesthesia type were not associated with failed SDD. CONCLUSION: SDD is a safe and viable option for pre-selected patients interested in rapid recovery THA. The most common causes for failure to launch were failing to clear physical thereapy and patient symptomatology. Risk factors associated with failed SSD highlight the importance of preoperative counselling regarding smoking cessation and postoperative pain to set reasonable expectations. Future interventions should aim to improve patient postoperative mobilization, pain control, and decrease symptomatology.Cite this article: Bone Jt Open~2022;3(9):684-691.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early postoperative mobilisation is important for enhanced recovery, but can be hindered by orthostatic intolerance, characterised by dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling of heat, blurred vision and ultimately syncope. Although the incidence of orthostatic intolerance following total hip arthroplasty has been identified, few studies have yet investigated potential risk factors for developing orthostatic intolerance after hip arthroplasty. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of orthostatic intolerance on the first postoperative day after total hip arthroplasty, potential predisposing risk factors for developing orthostatic intolerance and its effect on length of stay. DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary hospital, Auckland, New Zealand, May to September 2015. PATIENTS: One hundred and seventeen consecutive patients undergoing unilateral total hip arthroplasty. Patients were excluded if they had revision surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of orthostatic intolerance during mobilisation on the first postoperative day. Significant peri-operative risk factors for developing orthostatic intolerance were identified using logistic regression. Length of stay was compared between orthostatic intolerant and orthostatic tolerant patients using the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: On the first postoperative day, 22\% of patients failed mobilisation due to orthostatic intolerance. Factors independently associated with orthostatic intolerance were female sex; OR (95\% CI), 3.11 (1.01 to 9.57), postoperative use of gabapentin; OR 3.55 (1.24 to 10.15) and high peak pain levels ({$\geq$}5/10) during mobilisation; OR 4.05 (1.30 to 12.61). Overall, 78\% of patients were correctly identified. The model was more accurate at predicting those who would not get orthostatic intolerance (89\% correct), compared with those who did have orthostatic intolerance (39\% correct). Length of stay was longer in patients with orthostatic intolerance (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.019). CONCLUSION: Orthostatic intolerance is common after total hip arthroplasty. Optimising pain control prior to mobilisation and limiting gabapentin use may modify the risk of developing postoperative orthostatic intolerance. Although personalised recovery pathways appear attractive, at present, the ability to predict at-risk individuals is still limited.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sciatic nerve injury following total hip arthroplasty (THA) predominantly affects the peroneal division of the sciatic nerve, often causing a foot drop. This can result from a focal etiology (hardware malposition, prominent screw, or postoperative hematoma) or nonfocal/traction injury. The objective of this study was to compare the clinicoradiological features and define the extent of nerve injury resulting from these two distinct mechanisms. METHODS: Patients who developed a postoperative foot drop within 1 year after primary or revision THA with a confirmed proximal sciatic neuropathy based on MRI or electrodiagnostic studies were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two cohorts: group 1 (focal injury), including patients with an identifiable focal structural etiology, and group 2 (nonfocal injury), including patients with a presumed traction injury. Patient demographics, clinical examinations, subsequent surgeries, electrodiagnostic study results, and MRI abnormalities were noted. The Student t-test was used to compare time to onset of foot drop and time to secondary surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, treated by one surgeon, met inclusion criteria (8 men and 13 women; 14 primary THAs and 7 revision THAs). Group 1 had a significantly longer time from THA to the onset of foot drop, with a mean of 2 months, compared with an immediate postoperative onset in group 2 (p = 0.02). Group 1 had a consistent pattern of localized focal nerve abnormality on imaging. In contrast, the majority of patients in group 2 (n = 11) had a long, continuous segment of abnormal size and signal intensity of the nerve, while the other 3 patients had a segment of less abnormal nerve in the midthigh on imaging. All patients with a long continuous lesion had Medical Research Council grade 0 dorsiflexion prior to secondary nerve surgeries compared with 1 of 3 patients with a more normal midsegment. CONCLUSIONS: There are distinct clinicoradiological findings in patients with sciatic injuries resulting from a focal structural etiology versus a traction injury. While there are discrete localized changes in patients with a focal etiology, those with traction injuries demonstrate a diffuse zone of abnormality within the sciatic nerve. A proposed mechanism involves anatomical tether points of the nerve acting as points of origin and propagation for traction injuries, resulting in an immediate postoperative foot drop. In contrast, patients with a focal etiology have localized imaging findings but a highly variable time to the onset of foot drop.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Preoperative anemia increases postoperative morbidity, mortality, and the risk of allogeneic transfusion. However, the incidence of preoperative anemia in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and its relationship to postoperative outcomes has not been previously reported. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search through PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Sincien, and Embase from inception to July 2023 to investigate the prevalence of preoperative anemia in patients undergoing Total Joint Arthroplasty, comorbidities between anemic and non-anemicpatients before surgery, and postoperative outcomes. postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Overall prevalence was calculated using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity between studies was examined by Cochran's Q test and quantified by the I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and validated by Egger's test. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies with 369,101 samples were included, all of which were retrospective cohort studies. 3 studies were of high quality and 18 studies were of moderate quality. The results showed that the prevalence of preoperative anemia was 22\% in patients awaiting arthroplasty; subgroup analyses revealed that the prevalence of preoperative anemia was highest in patients awaiting revision of total knee arthroplasty; the highest prevalence of preoperative anemia was found in the Americas; preoperative anemia was more prevalent in the female than in the male population; and preoperative anemia with a history of preoperative anemia was more common in the female than in the male population. patients with a history of preoperative anemia; patients with joint replacement who had a history of preoperative anemia had an increased risk of infection, postoperative blood transfusion rate, postoperative blood transfusion, Deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs, days in hospital, readmission within three months, and mortality compared with patients who did not have preoperative anemia. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of preoperative anemia in patients awaiting total joint arthroplasty is 22\%, and is higher in TKA and female patients undergoing revision, while preoperative anemia is detrimental to the patient's postoperative recovery and will increase the risk of postoperative complications, transfusion rates, days in the hospital, readmission rates, and mortality.},
