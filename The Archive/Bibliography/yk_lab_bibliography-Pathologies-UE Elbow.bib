  abstract = {Athletes are subject to traumatic and repetitive stress injuries at the elbow joint as a result of high levels of forces imparted across the elbow. Injuries can be acute to the point of tissue failure, or chronic as a result of repetitive overuse. Complete restoration of elbow function must be achieved to allow the athlete to return to their prior level of function. Systematic and progressive rehabilitation programs can help avoid overstressing healing tissues. Treatment programs are designed to restore full motion, muscular strength, endurance, and neuromuscular control. Multiphased rehabilitation programs are designed to restore function in the athlete's elbow.},
