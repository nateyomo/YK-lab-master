  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surfer's myelopathy is a rare, acute, atraumatic myelopathy that occurs in novice surfers. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature and to present an illustrative case. METHODS: Medical literature was queried for all reports of this condition, systematically abstracted, and analyzed. An illustrative case that provides the most definitive support for a vascular cause is presented. Treatment considerations based on prior cases and expert opinions are provided. RESULTS: Sixty-four cases of surfer's myelopathy have been reported to date. This atraumatic thoracic/conus medullaris myelopathy with only a 42\% neurological recovery rate almost uniformly affects young, healthy, novice surfers who have no pre-existent spinal disease. Symptoms usually start with back pain and rapidly progress to complete or incomplete myelopathy. T2 magnetic resonance images show increased signal in the central spinal cord within 24 to 72 hours. Gadolinium enhancement and diffusion-weighted imaging are not helpful. Angiography has been underused. Angiogram in our case showed the absence of a right T12 radicular artery and no artery of Adamkiewicz, which, along with clinical findings, support the vascular origin theory. Incomplete cases often improve within 24 hours of onset, whereas no improvement has been reported for American Spinal Injury Association class A cases. Several acute interventions have been tried. Steroids are most common, and patients receiving steroids improved 55\% of the time with no reported adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Surfer's myelopathy is a clinical entity associated with complete deficit in {$>$}50\% of cases. Its prognosis is almost exclusively dictated by severity at presentation/nadir. Thus, publicizing this rare but serious condition (within and outside the medical literature) may be an effective intervention.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent and disabling cause of low back and leg pain in older persons, affecting an estimated 103 million persons worldwide. Most are treated nonoperatively. Approximately 600\,000 surgical procedures are performed in the US each year for lumbar spinal stenosis. OBSERVATIONS: The prevalence of the clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis in US adults is approximately 11\% and increases with age. The diagnosis can generally be made based on a clinical history of back and lower extremity pain that is provoked by lumbar extension, relieved by lumbar flexion, and confirmed with cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nonoperative treatment includes activity modification such as reducing periods of standing or walking, oral medications to diminish pain such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. In a series of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis followed up for up to 3 years without operative intervention, approximately one-third of patients reported improvement, approximately 50\% reported no change in symptoms, and approximately 10\% to 20\% of patients reported that their back pain, leg pain, and walking were worse. Long-term benefits of epidural steroid injections for lumbar spinal stenosis have not been demonstrated. Surgery appears effective in carefully selected patients with back, buttock, and lower extremity pain who do not improve with conservative management. For example, in a randomized trial of 94 participants with symptomatic and radiographic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, decompressive laminectomy improved symptoms more than nonoperative therapy (difference, 7.8 points; 95\% CI, 0.8-14.9; minimum clinically important difference, 10-12.8) on the Oswestry Disability Index (score range, 0-100). Among persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and concomitant spondylolisthesis, lumbar fusion increased symptom resolution in 1 trial (difference, 5.7 points; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 11.3) on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical dimension score (range, 0-100), but 2 other trials showed either no important differences between the 2 therapies or noninferiority of lumbar decompression alone compared with lumbar decompression plus spinal fusion (MCID, 2-4.9 points). In a noninferiority trial, 71.4\% treated with lumbar decompression alone vs 72.9\% of those receiving decompression plus fusion achieved a 30\% or more reduction in Oswestry Disability Index score, consistent with the prespecified noninferiority hypothesis. Fusion is associated with greater risk of complications such as blood loss, infection, longer hospital stays, and higher costs. Thus, the precise indications for concomitant lumbar fusion in persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis remain unclear. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Lumbar spinal stenosis affects approximately 103 million people worldwide and 11\% of older adults in the US. First-line therapy is activity modification, analgesia, and physical therapy. Long-term benefits from epidural steroid injections have not been established. Selected patients with continued pain and activity limitation may be candidates for decompressive surgery.},

  abstract = {One of the most prevalent degenerative musculoskeletal conditions is lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSS), which is characterized by narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal that pressures the nerve roots and cauda equine. LSS, when treated surgically, usually presents with foot drop as its major complication. Foot drop is a common presentation of several clinical diseases, traditionally characterized as severe weakening of ankle and toe dorsiflexion. Foot drop has a great impact on patients' lives, lowering their quality of life and affecting their activities of daily living. Ankle dorsiflexion weakness leads to foot drop and a high-stepping gait, which can cause multiple falls and accidents. This case study aimed to assess the efficacy of a customized physiotherapy program in a 50-year-old woman with paraparesis along with left foot drop and post-surgery complications following lumbar decompression and spinal fusion at L3-S1 (lumbar-sacral) level after a jerk experienced by her while working out in the gym. The objective was to determine the impact of individualized exercises on the patient's strength, gait, balance, and pelvic floor function over a 12-week rehabilitation period. The interventions included lower limb exercises (stretching exercises, strengthening exercises, and weight-bearing exercises), pelvic floor exercises, and core stability training. The findings demonstrated significant improvements in the patient's functional outcomes, as evidenced by enhanced scores in the Berg Balance Scale, Manual Muscle Testing, Dynamic Gait Index, Barthel Index, and Stanmore Assessment Questionnaire. Notable progress was observed in the strength, balance, gait, and pelvic floor function, highlighting the positive influence of targeted physiotherapeutic interventions. This case underscores the importance of tailored exercise plans in addressing the complexities of post-surgery challenges, emphasizing the potential for comprehensive recovery and improved overall quality of life through personalized physiotherapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lumbar spine pathology (LSP) is a common source of low back or leg pain, and paraspinal muscle in these patients demonstrates fatty and fibrotic infiltration, and cellular degeneration that do not reverse with exercise-based rehabilitation. However, it is unclear of this lack of response is due to insufficient exercise stimulus, or an inability to mount a growth response. The purpose of this study was to compare paraspinal muscle gene expression between individuals with LSP who do and do not undergo an acute bout of resistance exercise. METHODS: Paraspinal muscle biopsies were obtained from 64 individuals with LSP undergoing spinal surgery. Eight participants performed an acute bout of machine-based lumbar extension resistance exercise preoperatively. Gene expression for 42 genes associated with adipogenic/metabolic, atrophic, fibrogenic, inflammatory, and myogenic pathways was measured, and differential expression between exercised and non-exercised groups was evaluated for (a) the full cohort, and (b) an age, gender, acuity, and etiology matched sub-cohort. Principal components analyses were used to identify gene expression clustering across clinical phenotypes. RESULTS: The exercised cohort demonstrated upregulation of inflammatory gene IL1B, inhibition of extracellular matrix components (increased MMP3\&9, decreased TIMP1\&3, COL1A1) and metabolic/adipogenic genes (FABP4, PPARD, WNT10B), and downregulation of myogenic (MYOD, ANKRD2B) and atrophic (FOXO3) genes compared to the non-exercised cohort, with similar patterns in the matched sub-analysis. There were no clinical phenotypes significantly associated with gene expression profiles. CONCLUSION: An acute bout of moderate-high intensity resistance exercise did not result in upregulation of myogenic genes in individuals with LSP. The response was characterized by mixed metabolic and fibrotic gene expression, upregulation of inflammation, and downregulation of myogenesis.},

  abstract = {Spine Anatomy Collectively, the spine has an anterior and a posterior region (see Image. Lumbar Vertebral Anatomy). The cylindrical vertebral bodies comprise the anterior spine, separated by intervertebral (IV) disks and held in place by the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments. The IV disks have the gelatinous nucleus pulposus in the middle, surrounded by the cartilaginous annulus fibrosus (see Image. Intervertebral Disk). The cervical and lumbar spinal segments have the largest IV disks, owing to these regions' mobility. The anterior spine is a shock absorber of bodily movements. The vertebral arches and processes constitute the posterior spine. Each vertebral arch has an anterior pair of cylindrical pedicles and a posterior pair of laminae (see Image. Lumbar Vertebra, Superoposterior View). Other structures emanating from the vertebral arch include 2 lateral transverse processes, 1 posterior process, and 2 superior and 2 inferior articular facets. Facet joints form from superior and inferior facet apposition. The spinal canal, which houses the spinal cord, is formed by the vertebral bodies and IV disks anteriorly and vertebral arches posteriorly. The nerve roots exit superior to their corresponding vertebral body through the intervertebral canal. The ligamentum flavum (yellow ligament) is a thick, fibrous structure passing between adjacent laminae. The lateral recess is an anatomic space in the posterior spine bounded anteriorly by the vertebral body and disk, posteriorly by the ligamentum flavum and vertebral arch, laterally by the pedicle, and medially by the thecal sac. This region is narrow and is a potential area of nerve root compression. The posterior spine has various functions, including spinal cord and nerve root protection and muscle and ligament support.~~ Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is the narrowing of the lumbar vertebra in the central canal, lateral recess, or neural foraminal areas.~Central canal stenosis may compress the thecal sac and bilateral spinal segments and thus, in the severe form, may produce bilateral symptoms. Lateral recess and neural foraminal stenosis may compress the nerve roots and produce unilateral lumbar radiculopathy symptoms.~ Central stenosis arises from anterior ligamentum flavum hypertrophy compounded by posterior disk bulging. This condition is more prevalent at the L4 to L5 level than other spinal segments. Meanwhile, lateral recess stenosis results from facet arthropathy and osteophyte formation, compressing the nerve before it passes the intervertebral foramen. Foraminal stenosis is due to disk height loss, foraminal disk protrusion, or osteophyte formation. These changes impinge on the nerve root inside the intervertebral foramen. Extraforaminal stenosis is usually due to far lateral disk herniation. This condition compresses the nerve root after exiting the intervertebral foramen laterally.~ LSS is a significant cause of disability in older individuals and a common spinal surgery indication in patients older than 65 years.~Henk Verbiest first described relative and absolute spinal stenosis as lumbar canal midsagittal diameter of less than 12 mm and 10 mm, respectively. However, LSS clinical and radiologic diagnostic criteria have not been established despite this condition's global prevalence. Thus, this clinical entity has no universally accepted definition.},
