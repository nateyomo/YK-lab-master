  abstract = {Exercise and pain neuroscience education (PNE) have both been used as standalone treatments for chronic musculoskeletal pain. The evidence supporting PNE as an adjunct to exercise therapy is growing but remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of combining PNE and exercise for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, when compared with exercise alone. A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted from inception to November 6, 2020. A quality effects model was used to meta-analyze outcomes where possible. Five high-quality randomized controlled studies (n = 460) were included in this review. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of individual studies, and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation analysis was conducted to determine the quality of evidence for each outcome. Meta-analyses were performed for pain intensity, disability, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophizing using data reported between 0 and 12 weeks postintervention. Long-term outcomes ({$>$}12 weeks) were only available for 2 studies and therefore were not suitable for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed a significant difference in pain (weighted mean differences, -2.09/10; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -3.38 to -0.80; low certainty), disability (standardized mean difference, -0.68; 95\% CI, -1.17 to -0.20; low certainty), kinesiophobia (standardized mean difference, -1.20; CI, -1.84 to -0.57; moderate certainty), and pain catastrophizing (weighted mean differences, -7.72; 95\% CI, -12.26 to -3.18; very low certainty) that favoured the combination of PNE and exercise. These findings suggest that combining PNE and exercise in the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain results in greater short-term improvements in pain, disability, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophizing relative to exercise alone.},

  abstract = {Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is an urgent global public health concern. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) is an intervention used in the management of CMP aiming to reconceptualize an individual's understanding of their pain as less threatening. This mixed-methods review undertook a segregated synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies to investigate the clinical effectiveness, and patients' experience of, PNE for people with CMP. Electronic databases were searched for studies published between January 1, 2002, and June 14, 2018. Twelve randomized, controlled trials (n\,=\,755 participants) that reported pain, disability, and psychosocial outcomes and 4 qualitative studies (n\,=\,50 participants) that explored patients experience of PNE were included. The meta-analyzed pooled treatment effects for PNE versus control had low clinical relevance in the short term for pain (-5.91/100; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -13.75 to 1.93) and disability (-4.09/100; 95\% CI, -7.72 to -.45) and in the medium term for pain (-6.27/100; 95\% CI, -18.97 to 6.44) and disability (-8.14/100; 95\% CI, -15.60 to -.68). The treatment effect of PNE for kinesiophobia was clinically relevant in the short term (-13.55/100; 95\% CI, -25.89 to -1.21) and for pain catastrophizing in the medium term (-5.26/52; 95\% CI, -10.59 to .08). A metasynthesis of 23 qualitative findings resulted in the identification of 2 synthesized findings that identified several key components important for enhancing the patient experience of PNE, such as allowing the patient to tell their own story. These components can enhance pain reconceptualization, which seems to be an important process to facilitate patients' ability to cope with their condition. The protocol was published on PROSPERO (CRD42017068436). Perspective: We outline the effectiveness of PNE for the management of pain, disability, and psychosocial outcomes in adults with CMP. Key components that can enhance the patient experience of PNE, such as allowing the patient to tell their own story, are also presented. These components may enhance pain reconceptualization.},
