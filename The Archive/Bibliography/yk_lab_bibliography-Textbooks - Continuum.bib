  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article reviews the most common leukodystrophies and is focused on diagnosis, clinical features, and emerging therapeutic options.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               In the past decade, the recognition of leukodystrophies has exponentially increased, and now this class includes more than 30 distinct disorders. Classically recognized as progressive and fatal disorders affecting young children, it is now understood that leukodystrophies are associated with an increasing spectrum of neurologic trajectories and can affect all ages. Next-generation sequencing and newborn screening allow the opportunity for the recognition of presymptomatic and atypical cases. These new testing opportunities, in combination with growing numbers of natural history studies and clinical consensus guidelines, have helped improve diagnosis and clinical care. Additionally, a more granular understanding of disease outcomes informs clinical trial design and has led to several recent therapeutic advances. This review summarizes the current understanding of the clinical manifestations of disease and treatment options for the most common leukodystrophies.                                         SUMMARY               As early testing becomes more readily available through next-generation sequencing and newborn screening, neurologists will better understand the true incidence of the leukodystrophies and be able to diagnose children within the therapeutic window. As targeted therapies are developed, it becomes increasingly imperative that this broad spectrum of disorders is recognized and diagnosed. This work summarizes key advances in the leukodystrophy field.},

Every person with migraine requires treatment for acute attacks. Treatments can range from behavioral management and nonspecific medications to migraine-specific medications and neuromodulation. For many with migraine, having a combination of tools allows for effective treatment of all types of attacks.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Over the past several years, four neuromodulation devices have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of acute migraine, and three medications with novel mechanisms of action have been FDA approved. They add to the arsenal available to people with migraine and focus on migraine-specific pathways to allow for precise care with fewer side effects.

Recent Findings:               Advances in clinical phenotyping and outcomes assessment have enabled neurologists to improve disease recognition, treatment, and disease monitoring. Our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of demyelinating neuropathies is evolving. Identification of new antibodies and recognition that node of Ranvier dysfunction may be an early pathogenic feature may herald further diagnostic and treatment advancements.                                         Summary:               The chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies are heterogeneous. The clinical and diagnostic features are sometimes overlapping, and the specific disorders are variable in pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis. This heterogeneity underscores the importance of achieving diagnostic accuracy and implementing disease-specific treatment approaches.},

It discusses the importance of diagnosing and detecting progression early, the similarities between progressive forms, challenges in detecting progression, factors that could augment progression, and the importance of disease-modifying therapies in patients with evidence of active progressive MS. It also discusses the overall care of progressive MS.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               The pathogenesis of primary progressive MS and secondary progressive MS is overlapping, and in both presentations, patients with relapses or focal MRI activity are classified as having active, progressive MS. All currently approved disease-modifying therapies are indicated for active secondary progressive MS. The therapeutic opportunity of anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of progressive MS is enhanced in those who are younger and have a shorter disease duration. Vascular comorbidities may contribute to progression in MS.                                         SUMMARY               Several challenges remain in the diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment of progressive MS. Early identification of active progressive MS is needed to maximize treatment benefit. The advantages of optimal comorbidity management (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) in delaying progression are uncertain. Clinical care guidelines for advanced, severe MS are lacking.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Arterial ischemic stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are increasingly recognized in childhood as important causes of lifelong morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of arterial ischemic stroke is frequently delayed, as acute neurologic deficits can be challenging to detect in the young child, and stroke is often not considered in the differential diagnosis. Neurologic sequelae following stroke are common, and strategies to minimize stroke size and optimize recovery are being developed. Recurrent arterial ischemic stroke is not uncommon, particularly in children with cerebral arteriopathy. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis causes obstruction of venous outflow leading to venous infarcts. Complications include hemorrhagic conversion of infarcts and increased intracranial pressure. Without treatment, thrombus extension with increased symptoms is common. Robust guidelines of care that exist for adults do not exist for children, particularly for children with arterial ischemic stroke.                                         SUMMARY               The approach to stroke in infants and children can be informed by clinical experience in pediatric stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, the extensive literature on pediatric thrombosis, and extrapolation from data from adult patients.},

These therapies predispose patients to particular infections, some of which may affect the nervous system. Therefore, familiarity with the clinical and radiologic features of neurologic infections associated with specific immunomodulatory therapies is of importance for the practicing neurologist. This article reviews these neuroinfectious conditions, as well as other neurologic complications unique to transplant recipients and other patients who are immunocompromised.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Diagnosis of infectious pathogens in patients who are immunocompromised may be particularly challenging because a decreased immune response can lead to atypical imaging or laboratory findings. Next-generation sequencing and other novel diagnostic modalities may improve the rate of early identification of neurologic infections in patients who are immunocompromised and ultimately ameliorate outcomes in this vulnerable population.                                         SUMMARY               A broad range of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections of the nervous system can complicate solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplantation as well as other forms of immunocompromise. In addition to neurologic infections, such patients are at risk of neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory complications related to immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapies. Early recognition of infectious and noninfectious complications of immunocompromise is essential to guide appropriate treatment, which can include antimicrobial therapy and, in some cases, withdrawal of the predisposing medication with a transition to an alternative regimen.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Clinical diagnostic criteria for both Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies have been recently updated. These criteria result in overlap between individuals diagnosed with Parkinson disease and those with dementia with Lewy bodies. Although clinical features and symptomatic treatment overlap, differences remain in epidemiology and expected progression. The high prevalence of cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease supports regular screening for cognitive changes and counseling patients and families regarding what to expect. Treatment for Lewy body dementia involves avoiding medications that may cause or exacerbate symptoms; prescribing pharmacologic agents to address bothersome cognitive, behavioral, movement, and other nonmotor symptoms; recommending physical exercise and therapy; and providing education, counseling, caregiver support, and palliative care.                                         SUMMARY               Lewy body dementia includes both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia, overlapping clinicopathologic entities with differences relating to diagnosis and expected progression.

RECENT FINDINGS               As more patients are becoming therapeutically immunosuppressed, human herpesvirus infections are increasingly common. Historically, infections with human herpesviruses were described as temporal lobe encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 or type 2. More recently, however, additional pathogens, such as varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6 have been identified to cause serious neurologic infections. As literature emerges, clinical presentations of herpesvirus infections have taken on many new forms, becoming heterogeneous and involving nearly every location along the neuraxis. Advanced diagnostic methods are now available for each specific pathogen in the herpesvirus family. As data emerge on viral resistance to conventional therapies, newer antiviral medications must be considered.                                         SUMMARY               Infections from the herpesvirus family can have devastating neurologic outcomes without prompt and appropriate treatment. Clinical recognition of symptoms and appropriate advanced testing are necessary to correctly identify the infectious etiology. Knowledge of secondary neurologic complications of disease is equally important to prevent additional morbidity and mortality. This article discusses infections of the central and peripheral nervous systems caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6. The pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentations of disease, diagnostic investigations, imaging characteristics, and treatment for each infectious etiology are discussed in detail.},

This article contextualizes health disparities as they relate to the neurodegenerative processes of ADRD.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Older adults' life expectancy has increased such that a 65-year-old is expected to live 19 or more years and an 85-year-old can expect to live, on average, 6 to 7 years longer. Individuals of certain ethnoracial groups (Black, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) may be at a higher risk of incident ADRD compared to non-Hispanic/Latino White people. These differences in a higher risk of ADRD across ethnoracial groups persist despite no statistically significant differences in the rate of cognitive decline over time. The intersectionality of social determinants of health, experiences with discrimination and oppression, and access to care are related to the issue of justice and the risk for and expression of ADRD.

Studies indicate that a generic cognitive neurologic evaluation does not reliably detect spatial neglect, nor does it identify unawareness of deficit after right brain stroke; this article reviews the symptoms, clinical presentation, and management of these two cognitive disorders occurring after right brain stroke.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Stroke and occupational therapy practice guidelines stress a quality standard for spatial neglect assessment and treatment to reduce adverse outcomes for patients, their families, and society. Neurologists may attribute poor outcomes associated with spatial neglect to stroke severity. However, people with spatial neglect are half as likely to return to home and community, have one-third the community mobility, and require 3 times as much caregiver supervision compared with similar stroke survivors. Multiple randomized trials support a feasible first-line rehabilitation approach for spatial neglect: prism adaptation therapy; more than 20 studies reported that this treatment improves daily life independence. Evidence-based treatment of anosognosia is not as developed; however, treatment for this problem is also available.

Key aspects of the pathophysiology, signs, and symptoms, treatment and rehabilitation, and recovery from concussion/mild TBI are reviewed with an emphasis on the variety of factors that may contribute to cognitive concerns following injury.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms that occur in the immediate aftermath of an applied force and in the hours, days, and weeks thereafter. Although advances have been made in advanced diagnostics, including neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers in hopes of developing objective indicators of injury, such markers currently lack sufficient specificity to be used in clinical diagnostics. The symptoms of concussion are heterogeneous and may be seen to form subtypes, each of which suggests a targeted rehabilitation by the interdisciplinary team. Although the majority of patients with concussion recover within the first 30 to 90 days after injury, some have persistent disabling symptoms. The concept of                 postconcussion syndrome                 , implying a chronic syndrome of injury-specific symptoms, is replaced by a broader concept of                 persistent symptoms after concussion                 . This concept emphasizes the fact that most persistent symptoms have their basis in complex somatic, cognitive, psychiatric, and psychosocial factors related to risk and resilience. This framework leads to the important conclusion that concussion is a treatable injury from which nearly all patients can be expected to recover.                                                        SUMMARY               Concussion/mild TBI is a significant public health problem in civilian, military, and organized athletic settings. Recent advances have led to a better understanding of underlying pathophysiology and symptom presentation and efficacious treatment and rehabilitation of the resulting symptoms. An interdisciplinary team is well-positioned to provide problem-oriented, integrated care to facilitate recovery and to advance the evidence base supporting effective practice in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.},

This article provides the tools to diagnose and manage patients with autism spectrum disorder.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Autism spectrum disorder is a heterogeneous condition with varying presentations, multiple etiologies, and a number of comorbidities that impact the course and management of the disorder. This article defines the core features of social communication deficits, including problems with social reciprocity, decreased nonverbal communication, and difficulties in developing and maintaining relationships. The second domain of repetitive behaviors and restricted interests, which includes the presence of stereotyped behaviors or speech, insistence on sameness and behavioral rigidity, intense or out of the ordinary interests, and unusual responses to sensory stimulation, is also delineated. Comorbidities commonly seen with autism spectrum disorder include medical, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions. Despite intense research efforts, the etiology of autism spectrum disorder remains unknown in most cases, but it is clear that a strong genetic component exists that interacts with various environmental risk factors. Current research is identifying overlapping neurobiological pathways that are involved in pathogenesis. Treatment involves intensive behavioral therapy and educational programming along with traditional ancillary services, such as speech/language, occupational, and physical therapies. Psychopharmacologic treatments are also used to target certain symptoms and comorbid conditions.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologists can play an important role in diagnosing autism spectrum disorder according to clinical criteria through a comprehensive evaluation that includes a thorough medical and developmental history, behavioral and play observations, and a review of standardized cognitive and language evaluations. Neurologists are also responsible for investigating etiologies, recommending and advocating for appropriate behavioral and educational interventions, and identifying and often managing comorbidities.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Rehabilitation is an important aspect of the continuum of care in stroke. With advances in the acute treatment of stroke, more patients will survive stroke with varying degrees of disability. Research in the past decade has expanded our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stroke recovery and has led to the development of new treatment modalities. This article reviews and summarizes the key concepts related to poststroke recovery.                                         Recent Findings:               Good data now exist by which one can predict recovery, especially motor recovery, very soon after stroke onset. Recent trials have not demonstrated a clear benefit associated with very early initiation of rehabilitative therapy after stroke in terms of improvement in poststroke outcomes. However, growing evidence suggests that shorter and more frequent sessions of therapy can be safely started in the first 24 to 48 hours after a stroke. The optimal amount or dose of therapy for stroke remains undetermined, as more intensive treatments have not been associated with better outcomes compared to standard intensities of therapy. Poststroke depression adversely affects recovery across a variety of measures and is an important target for therapy. Additionally, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appears to benefit motor recovery through pleiotropic mechanisms beyond their antidepressant effect. Other pharmacologic approaches also appear to have a benefit in stroke rehabilitation.                                         Summary:               A comprehensive rehabilitation program is essential to optimize poststroke outcomes. Rehabilitation is a process that uses three major principles of recovery: adaptation, restitution, and neuroplasticity. Based on these principles, multiple different approaches, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, exist to enhance rehabilitation. In addition to neurologists, a variety of health care professionals are involved in stroke rehabilitation. Successful rehabilitation involves understanding the natural history of stroke recovery and a multidisciplinary approach with judicious use of resources to identify and treat common poststroke sequelae.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Functional neuroimaging studies have elucidated the areas involved in central control of autonomic function in humans. Optogenetic and other novel approaches in animal experiments have provided new insights into the role of these areas in autonomic control across behavioral states, including stress and the sleep-wake cycle.                                         SUMMARY               Control of the function of the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous system functions depends on complex interactions at all levels of the neuraxis. Peripheral sympathetic outputs are critical for maintenance of blood pressure, thermoregulation, and response to stress. Parasympathetic reflexes control lacrimation, salivation, pupil response to light, beat-to-beat control of the heart rate, gastrointestinal motility, micturition, and erectile function. The insular cortex, anterior and midcingulate cortex, and amygdala generate autonomic responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli. Several nuclei of the hypothalamus generate coordinated patterns of autonomic responses to internal or social stressors. Several brainstem nuclei participate in integrated control of autonomic function in relationship to respiration and the sleep-wake cycle. Disorders affecting the central or peripheral autonomic pathways, or both, manifest with autonomic failure (including orthostatic hypotension, anhidrosis, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and neurogenic bladder or erectile dysfunction) or autonomic hyperactivity, primary hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperhidrosis.},

Initial emphasis is placed on clinical history, examination, diagnostic testing, and medical decision making, while subsequent focus is placed on examining specific inflammatory optic neuropathies. Clinical clues, examination findings, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing that differentiate autoimmune, granulomatous, demyelinating, infectious, and paraneoplastic causes of optic neuritis are assessed, and current treatments are evaluated.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in technology and immunology have enhanced our understanding of the pathologies driving inflammatory optic nerve injury.

SUMMARY               Optic neuritis is a common clinical manifestation of central nervous system inflammation. Depending on the etiology, visual prognosis and the risk for recurrent injury may vary. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of optic neuritis may be critical for limiting vision loss, future neurologic disability, and organ damage.

RECENT FINDINGS               The increased use of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapy to treat autoimmune diseases has led to an increase in opportunistic neurologic infections. The description of numerous causes of autoimmune antibody--mediated encephalitis over the past decade has expanded the differential diagnosis of encephalitis beyond infection. The emergence of metagenomic next-generation sequencing has led to diagnoses of rare or unexpected causes of neurologic infections and has the potential to enhance diagnostic precision in neuroinfectious diseases.                                         SUMMARY               Infections of the nervous system can affect any level of the neuraxis and present over any time course. Neurologic infections may present atypically with respect to clinical, radiologic, and CSF analysis features in immunocompromised patients or older adults. A thorough evaluation including systemic features, past medical history, travel, exposures, detailed examination, neuroimaging, and CSF analysis is often necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. It is important to be aware of the test characteristics and limitations of microbiological tests on CSF for neurologic infections to avoid being misled by false positives or false negatives.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Tetanus is most common in lower-income settings, but rare cases are seen in higher-income settings because of the inadequate maintenance of vaccination status. Foodborne botulism remains rare, but botulism can also be caused by IV drug use (wound botulism) and medical use of botulinum toxin (iatrogenic botulism); botulinum toxin has also been considered a potential agent of bioterrorism. Diphtheric neuropathy is rare but has been seen in recent epidemics in the former Soviet Union, and vaccination status is inadequate in a significant proportion of older individuals, creating the potential for subsequent epidemics.                                         SUMMARY               Tetanus, botulism, and diphtheric neuropathy are rare in higher-resource settings where most neurologists practice; however, familiarity with the unique clinical manifestations of and laboratory evaluation for these disorders is essential for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of patients with these conditions.},

This article reviews the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of infections of the spine and spinal cord to help practicing clinicians recognize, evaluate, and manage patients with such infections.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Aging of the population, increasing use of immunosuppressive medications, and other factors have contributed to increasing rates of spinal infections. Although the most common agents responsible for spinal infections remain bacteria and viruses, fungal infections occur in individuals who are immunocompromised, and parasitic infections are common in endemic regions, but patterns are in evolution with migration and climate change. Recent outbreaks of acute flaccid myelitis in children have been associated with enteroviruses A71 and D68.

A particular focus is on improving diagnostic accuracy to reduce the arduous diagnostic odyssey that so many patients and families endure. Strategies to promote diagnostic accuracy and approach the management of problematic symptoms are also discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although the International Consensus Criteria for bvFTD were published more than a decade ago and clinicopathologic studies have confirmed their utility, diagnostic confusion continues. This article presents updated data along with illustrative cases to emphasize the clinical pearls that are most useful for clinicians. Although accurate prediction of the underlying proteinopathy remains a challenge, the ability to differentiate bvFTD from atypical Alzheimer disease, psychiatric disorders, and other mimickers has improved. Knowledge about the genetic underpinnings in a significant minority of individuals with familial FTLD is enabling early and accurate diagnosis. Therapeutic optimism has also increased, particularly in familial FTLD, with a few clinical trials in progress and several more planned, some of which are designed to slow progression or delay the onset of symptoms, or both.                                         SUMMARY               The diagnosis and management of bvFTD is challenging for clinicians and particularly for patients and their families. Although much progress has been gained over recent years, several key research questions persist. Treatments that significantly improve symptoms or alter the course of FTLD remain elusive, but optimism is increasing as pathobiology is better understood and novel therapies are being developed.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Metastasis of cancer to the CNS can be diagnosed and characterized with novel techniques, including molecular analyses of the spinal fluid, so-called                 liquid biopsies                 . Resected parenchymal CNS metastases are now routinely subjected to genomic sequencing. For patients with CNS metastases displaying targetable mutations, a wide variety of treatment options are available, including deferral of radiation therapy in favor of a trial of an orally bioavailable targeted therapy or immunotherapy. For patients without a molecularly targetable lesion, local treatment in the form of radiation therapy, now most often stereotactic radiosurgery, is supplanting untargeted whole-brain radiation therapy.                                                        SUMMARY               Technologic advances in diagnosis and management have resulted in new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to patients with metastasis to the CNS, with resulting improvements in progression-free and overall survival.},

This article covers the salient features of the migraine postdrome and provides insight into the history, clinical symptoms, and future implications of this phase of migraine.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Prospective electronic diary studies have shown that patients are left disabled with various nonheadache symptoms in the migraine postdrome, and 81\% of patients report at least one nonheadache symptom in the postdrome. Hence, it is important to understand this phase better and ensure that more effective treatments become available in the future to lessen the morbidity associated with this phase. Functional imaging shows widespread reduction in brain-blood flow in the postdrome, which explains the multitudes of symptoms experienced by patients.                                         SUMMARY               The disability related to migraine is not exclusive to the headache phase but extends into the postdrome phase and is associated with several nonheadache symptoms that prolong the symptoms experienced by patients with migraine. Further research into the postdrome is crucial to improve our overall understanding of migraine mechanisms. This knowledge may also help to treat the concurrent nonheadache symptoms better in the future. Novel neuroimaging techniques provide a valuable noninvasive tool to push the frontiers in the understanding of migraine pathophysiology. These methods may help shed further light onto the possible links between key brain structures and networks that could be implicated in the pathophysiology of the various migraine phases.},

An outline of the history and controversy surrounding how these disorders are classified is provided before the article focuses on each disorder's clinical and imaging features.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Over the past decade, the classification of degenerative speech and language disorders has been refined. Clinical, imaging, and pathologic evidence suggests that primary progressive apraxia of speech is a distinct degenerative disorder. Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence have highlighted issues with nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA, which complicates the diagnosis, prognosis, and study of this disorder. Semantic variant PPA, while not without controversy, remains one of the most well-defined disorders, with good clinicopathologic correlation.                                         SUMMARY               Accurate classification and diagnosis of these degenerative speech and language disorders is crucial in clinical practice and ongoing research efforts. For nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA, the authors suggest emphasizing agrammatism as the core inclusion criterion and taking care not to include patients with isolated or predominant apraxia of speech. Isolated apraxia of speech can be the manifestation of a degenerative disease and, based on the different prognosis, should be recognized as distinct from PPA. Finally, it is important to recognize that some patients with semantic dementia, despite sharing the same pathologic associations, may not meet criteria for PPA.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The contribution of rods and cones to the pupillary light reflex has long been known. A third photosensitive cell type, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell, has recently been discovered. This cell type employs melanopsin to mediate a portion of the pupillary light reflex independent of rods and cones (the postillumination pupillary response) and photic regulation of circadian rhythm.                                         SUMMARY               The autonomic nervous system regulates pupil size in response to stimuli. The parasympathetic nervous system causes miosis in response to light and near visual stimuli. These stimuli activate supranuclear pathways that project to the Edinger-Westphal nuclei. The sympathetic nervous system causes mydriasis in response to a variety of arousing factors, both physiologic (wakefulness) and pathologic (pain). Abnormalities of physiologic function cause disturbances of pupil size, shape, and response to stimuli. The clinical approach to pupillary abnormalities should focus on the clinical and pharmacologic assessment of the pupil's expected response to diverse stimuli.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Our understanding of neuroimmune disorders of the central nervous system is rapidly expanding. Several clinical and paraclinical factors help to inform the diagnosis and ultimately the suspicion for a monophasic versus relapsing course, including the age of the patient (prepubertal versus postpubertal), presence or absence of clinical encephalopathy, identification of serum autoantibodies (eg, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein [MOG] and aquaporin-4), presence of intrathecally unique oligoclonal bands, and location/extent of radiologic abnormalities.

RECENT FINDINGS               The migraine preventive treatment landscape has been transformed by the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP or its receptor. These treatments, which are given subcutaneously or intravenously monthly or quarterly, have high efficacy and were well tolerated in clinical trials. Emerging real-world studies have found higher rates of adverse events than were seen in clinical trials. They are currently recommended for use if two traditional preventive therapies have proven inadequate. Since the commonly cited 2012 American Headache Society/American Academy of Neurology migraine prevention guidelines were released, clinical trials supporting the preventive use of lisinopril, candesartan, and memantine have been published. Neuromodulation devices, including external trigeminal nerve stimulation and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation devices, have modest evidence to support preventive use. The American Headache Society/American Academy of Neurology guidelines for the preventive treatment of migraine are currently being updated. A new class of oral CGRP receptor antagonists (gepants) is being tested for migraine prevention.                                         SUMMARY               Successful preventive treatment of migraine reduces disease burden and improves quality of life. Many pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options are available for the prevention of migraine, including newer therapies aimed at the CGRP pathway as well as older treatments with good evidence for efficacy.

The TACs are composed of five diseases: cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT), short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA), and hemicrania continua.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                New classifications for the TACs have two important updates; chronic cluster headache is now defined as remission periods lasting less than 3 months (formerly less than 1 month), and hemicrania continua is now classified as a TAC (formerly classified as                 other primary headache                 ). The first-line treatments of TACs have not changed in recent years: cluster headache is managed with oxygen, triptans, and verapamil; paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua are managed with indomethacin; and SUNCT and SUNA are managed with lamotrigine. However, advancements in neuromodulation have recently provided additional options for patients with cluster headache, which include noninvasive devices for abortive therapy and invasive devices for refractory cluster headache.

This article summarizes the clinical and genetic aspects of these disorders.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Historically, diagnoses of congenital muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy have been made by clinical features and histopathology; however, recent advances in genetics have changed diagnostic practice by relying more heavily on genetic findings. This article reviews the clinical and genetic features of the most common congenital muscular dystrophies including laminin subunit alpha 2 (LAMA2)--related (merosin deficient), collagen VI--related, and {$\alpha$}-dystroglycan--related congenital muscular dystrophies and reviews the most common congenital myopathies including nemaline rod, core, and centronuclear myopathies. With the increasing accessibility of genetic testing, the number of genes found to be associated with these disorders has increased dramatically. A wide spectrum of severity and onset (from birth to adulthood) exist across all subtypes. Progression and other features are variable depending on the subtype and severity of the specific genetic mutation.                                         SUMMARY               Congenital muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy are increasingly recognized disorders. A growing appreciation for the breadth of phenotypic variability and overlap between established subtypes has challenged long-standing phenotypic and histopathologic classifications of these disorders but has driven a greater understanding of pathogenesis and opened the door to the development of novel treatments.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Dementia clinical syndromes are frequently caused by mixed pathologies, leading to varied clinical presentations that include memory loss, behavioral changes, communication challenges, safety concerns, and loss of independent function. Medications for treating dementia currently target cognitive and behavioral symptoms, although disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease may be making their way into widespread clinical practice soon. Identification and treatment of co-occurring medical problems, such as obstructive sleep apnea, adverse medication effects, mood disorders, hearing loss, pain, alcohol misuse, and vascular risk factors, may mitigate the impact of these conditions on cognitive decline. Mobilization of clinical and community-based interprofessional teams will ensure that people with dementia and their care partners have the expertise, support, and access to resources they need. Addressing goals of care early in the disease course will allow people with dementia to contribute to their care plan by expressing their wishes.

The article presents an evaluation strategy that highly leverages the two major classification schemes of myoclonus. The goal of this article is to link evaluation strategy with diagnosis and treatment of myoclonus.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The growth of medical literature has helped better define myoclonus etiologies. Physiologic study of myoclonus types and etiologies with electrophysiologic testing has provided greater clarity to the pathophysiology of the myoclonus in various diseases. Although studies have been limited, the role of newer treatment agents and methods has made progress.                                         SUMMARY               Myoclonus has hundreds of different etiologies. Classification is necessary to evaluate myoclonus efficiently and pragmatically. The classification of myoclonus etiology, which is grouped by different clinical presentations, helps determine the etiology and treatment of the myoclonus. The classification of myoclonus physiology using electrophysiologic test results helps determine the pathophysiology of the myoclonus and can be used to strategize symptomatic treatment approaches. Both basic ancillary testing (including EEG and imaging) and more comprehensive testing may be necessary. Treatment of the underlying etiology is the ideal approach. However, if such treatment is not possible or is delayed, symptomatic treatment guided by the myoclonus physiology should be considered. More controlled study of myoclonus treatment is needed. Further research on myoclonus generation mechanisms should shed light on future treatment possibilities.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Determining the etiology of disorders that manifest with chronic dizziness can seem a daunting task, but extracting some basic elements of the patient's history can reduce the differential diagnosis significantly. This includes determining initial triggers, timing of symptoms, associated features, and exacerbating factors. This article covers distinct causes of chronic dizziness including persistent postural perceptual dizziness, mal de d{\'e}barquement syndrome, motion sickness and visually induced motion sickness, bilateral vestibulopathy, and persistent dizziness after mild concussion. RECENT FINDINGS: To date, none of the disorders above has a cure but are considered chronic syndromes with fluctuations that are both innate and driven by environmental stressors. As such, the mainstay of therapy for chronic disorders of dizziness involves managing factors that exacerbate symptoms and adding vestibular rehabilitation or cognitive-behavioral therapy alone or in combination, as appropriate. These therapies are supplemented by serotonergic antidepressants that modulate sensory gating and reduce anxiety. Besides expectation management, ruling out concurrent disorders and recognizing behavioral and lifestyle factors that affect symptom severity are critical issues in reducing morbidity for each disorder. SUMMARY: Many syndromes of chronic dizziness can be diagnosed by recognition of key features, although many symptoms overlap between these groups. Symptoms may be manageable and improve with time, but they are often incompletely relieved.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The pathology underlying {$\alpha$}-synucleinopathies, which include Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies, begins years before the presence of the full syndrome that is the basis for the clinical diagnosis of each of these disorders. This ``prodromal'' phase may manifest with various signs or symptoms. In addition to individuals in the prodromal phase, some individuals are asymptomatic but are at risk for {$\alpha$}-synucleinopathies owing to genetic predisposition or other risk factors.                                         SUMMARY               Clinicians are increasingly seeing patients in the clinical setting who are prodromal or at risk for {$\alpha$}-synucleinopathies, and this article reviews the approach to these patient populations, which includes identifying clinical features, assessment, and counseling.},

Emphasis is placed on understanding the common underlying types of cerebrovascular disease (including atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy) and awareness of rare inherited cerebrovascular disorders.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The pathophysiology of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia is heterogeneous, and the most recent diagnostic criteria for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia break down the diagnosis of major vascular dementia into four phenotypic categories, including subcortical ischemic vascular dementia, poststroke dementia, multi-infarct dementia, and mixed dementia. Control of cardiovascular risk factors, including management of midlife blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugars, remains the mainstay of prevention for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy requires special consideration when it comes to risk factor management given the increased risk of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Recent trials suggest some improvement in global cognitive function in patients with vascular cognitive impairment and dementia with targeted cognitive rehabilitation.                                         SUMMARY               Thorough clinical evaluation and neuroimaging form the basis for diagnosis. As vascular cognitive impairment and dementia is the leading nondegenerative cause of dementia, identifying risk factors and optimizing their management is paramount. Once vascular brain injury has occurred, symptomatic management should be offered and secondary prevention pursued.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Prospective clinical studies have reinforced the understanding that migraine aura is highly variable from one individual to the next as well as from attack to attack in an individual. While migraine with aura clearly has a higher heritability than migraine without aura, population studies have not identified specific genes that underlie this heritability for typical migraine with aura. Imaging studies reveal hypoperfusion associated with migraine aura, although the timing and distribution of this hypoperfusion is not strictly correlated with migraine symptoms. Mapping of migraine visual aura symptoms onto the visual cortex suggests that the mechanisms underlying the aura propagate in a linear fashion along gyri or sulci rather than as a concentric wave and also suggests that aura may propagate in the absence of clinical symptoms. Cortical spreading depression in animal models continues to be a translational model for migraine, and the study of spreading depolarizations in the injured human brain has provided new insight into potential mechanisms of cortical spreading depression in migraine. Migraine with aura has multiple comorbidities including patent foramen ovale, stroke, and psychiatric disorders; the shared mechanisms underlying these comorbidities remains a topic of active investigation.

With the aging population, the number of people with atherosclerotic stroke will increase in the coming decades. This article reviews the recent developments in the assessment and treatment of extracranial and intracranial atherosclerotic disease.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               More intensive dual antiplatelet therapy can now be recommended for patients with transient ischemic attack or stroke. More stringent blood pressure and lipid control is also advised. The need for carotid revascularization will likely decrease in the coming decades because of advances in multimodal medical therapy; in particular, the role of revascularization for treating asymptomatic carotid stenosis is controversial. Patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis should receive intensive medical therapy. Interest in high-resolution carotid plaque imaging is growing.

Their impact on human health ranges from benign to severe. Deciphering autonomic symptoms and signs draws on the cognitive skills and personal interest in the plight of patients that first attracted many physicians to the field of neurology. This article provides tools to sharpen those skills.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Autonomic neuroscience and accumulated clinical knowledge have led to the categorization of autonomic disorders into specific syndromes that can be identified on the basis of clinical phenotypes and physiologic responses to standardized stimuli in the autonomic laboratory. A key development has been the ability to distinguish neurogenic orthostatic hypotension from other causes of hypotension. Quantification of sudomotor responses has proven valuable in the diagnosis of thermoregulatory disorders and small fiber neuropathies such as those related to diabetes mellitus. Increasing attention has focused on autonomic failure as a defining feature of neurodegenerative {$\alpha$}-synucleinopathies, especially multiple system atrophy. As awareness of autonomic disorders has increased, the once obscure term                 dysautonomia                 has entered into common parlance.

The opportunity to play an important role in caring for patients with autonomic disorders is worth the effort.},

Neurally mediated syncope is an episodic phenomenon in which autonomic nervous system function is normal the rest of the time. Although relatively benign, syncope increases the risk for injury from falling and can substantially impair patients' quality of life. Recognition of its various clinical presentations and knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology are essential for accurate diagnosis and successful management.                                         Recent Findings:               The most effective forms of treatment remain education of patients, avoidance of triggers, physical counterpressure maneuvers, and hydration or intravascular volume expansion. Pharmacologic interventions may be appropriate for some patients but, in general, have limited evidence of efficacy in preventing syncope. Based on the findings of a recent study, the possibility of pulmonary embolism should be considered in patients hospitalized for syncope, whether or not an alternative etiology for syncope is identified.

This article reviews the anatomy of the spinal cord and discusses how the clinical findings, time course, and radiographic patterns can help to identify the causes of myelopathy.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Imaging observations such as MRI ``pancake'' gadolinium enhancement pattern with spondylotic myelopathy and subpial enhancement with neurosarcoidosis have improved diagnostic specificity. On the other hand, common diseases such as degenerative spine disease are now recognized as presenting much more variably. Improved imaging and the identification of genetic markers enhance the specificity of diagnosis. The improved identification of biomarkers has shown that the same cause, such as compressive myelopathy, can present more variably than previously appreciated.                                         SUMMARY               Spinal cord dysfunction, or myelopathy, remains a clinical diagnosis, and determining the cause requires integration of clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters, none of which have great specificity individually. Most cases of myelopathy will require further neuroimaging, and some require CSF analysis for diagnosis. This article presents an approach to the diagnosis of myelopathy based on excluding compressive myelopathy initially and then differentiating between acute and subacute processes and chronic causes.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains an important cause of mortality and long-term morbidity. This article uses a case-based approach to guide readers through the fundamental epidemiology and pathogenesis of SAH, the approach to diagnosis and management, the results of clinical trials and evidence to date, prognostic considerations, controversies, recent developments, and future directions in SAH.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Historically, management of SAH focused on prevention and treatment of subsequent cerebral vasospasm, which was thought to be the primary cause of delayed cerebral ischemia. Clinical and translational studies over the past decade, including several therapeutic phase 3 randomized clinical trials, suggest that the pathophysiology of SAH-associated brain injury is multiphasic and multifactorial beyond large vessel cerebral vasospasm. The quest to reduce SAH-associated brain injury and improve outcomes is shifting away from large vessel cerebral vasospasm to a new paradigm targeting multiple brain injury mechanisms, including early brain injury, delayed cerebral ischemia, microcirculatory dysfunction, spreading cortical depolarization, inflammation, and the brain-body interaction in vascular brain injury with critical illness.               Despite multiple negative randomized clinical trials in search of potential therapeutic agents ameliorating the downstream effects after SAH, the overall outcome of SAH has improved over recent decades, likely related to improvements in interventional options for ruptured cerebral aneurysms and in critical care management. Emerging clinical evidence also suggests potential harmful impact of historic empiric treatments for SAH-associated vasospasm, such as prophylactic induction of hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution (triple H therapy).               With decreasing mortality, long-term SAH survivorship and efforts to reduce chronic morbidity and to improve quality of life and patient-centered outcome are growing areas of unmet need. Despite existing guidelines, significant variabilities in local and regional practices and in scientific terminologies have historically limited advancement in SAH care and therapeutic development. Large global collaborative efforts developed harmonized SAH common data elements in 2019, and studies are under way to examine how existing variabilities in SAH care impact long-term SAH outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Although the overall incidence and mortality of SAH is decreasing with advances in preventive and acute care, SAH remains a major cause of long-term morbidity in survivors. Significant variabilities in care settings and empiric treatment protocols and inconsistent scientific terminologies have limited advancement in patient care and therapeutic clinical studies. Large consensus efforts are under way to introduce clinical guidelines and common data elements to advance therapeutic approaches and improve patient outcome.},

This article outlines the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of brain abscesses and spinal epidural abscesses, with a specific focus on bacterial infections.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The overall incidence of brain abscesses has declined, in part because of fewer brain abscesses associated with otogenic infections. However, emerging patient populations at high risk for brain abscess include those with a history of penetrating head trauma, neurosurgery, or immunodeficiency. Improved mortality rates for brain abscess are attributable to modern diagnostic imaging, stereotactic-guided aspiration, and newer antimicrobials that readily penetrate into the central nervous system and abscesses. Brain MRI is more sensitive than CT for brain abscess, particularly in the early stages, but CT remains more widely available and can adequately identify potential abscesses and confirm response to treatment. With the advent of minimally invasive neurosurgical techniques, surgical excision is often employed only for posterior fossa, multiloculated, or superficial well-circumscribed abscesses. In select clinical scenarios, conservative medical management may be a safe alternative to a combined surgical and medical approach. Unlike brain abscess, the incidence of spinal epidural abscess is on the rise and has been attributed to higher prevalence of predisposing factors, including spinal procedures and instrumentation.                                         SUMMARY               Successful diagnosis and management of brain abscess and spinal epidural abscess requires a collaborative approach among neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and infectious disease physicians. The foundation of management of brain abscess includes surgical intervention for diagnostic purposes if a pathogen has not been identified or for decompression of larger abscesses or those with mass effect and significant surrounding edema; appropriate dosing and adequate duration of an antimicrobial regimen tailored to the presumptive source of infection and available culture data, and eradication of the primary source of infection. For spinal epidural abscesses, neurologic status at the time of presentation is directly related to outcomes, underscoring the importance of prompt recognition and intervention.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis, the sexually transmissible stages of infection, has been on the rise for the past 2 decades. A concerning recent trend is the surge in cases of syphilis in women and of congenital syphilis. Neurosyphilis remains a relatively common complication that can occur at any stage of syphilis. Along with meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, which has been historically described as a late presentation of neurosyphilis, now frequently occurs as a manifestation of early infection. Late forms of neurosyphilis, including tabes dorsalis and general paresis, are less prevalent in the era of widespread penicillin use. As more laboratories adopt the reverse-sequence algorithm for syphilis testing, patients with serodiscordant results (ie, a reactive serum treponemal test with a nonreactive nontreponemal test) may present an increasingly encountered diagnostic challenge for neurologists. Although the CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) remains a mainstay of diagnostic testing for neurosyphilis, using a higher titer cutoff (greater than 1:320) for the                 Treponema pallidum                 particle agglutination assay (TPPA) from the CSF may improve the utility of the TPPA as a supporting criterion for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Penicillin G is the treatment of choice for neurosyphilis, although ceftriaxone may be a reasonable alternative therapy.                                                        SUMMARY               A high index of suspicion and awareness of the variable clinical presentations of neurosyphilis are essential to the approach to this treatable infection. Neurologists should be mindful of the limitations of serologic testing in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis and exercise clinical judgment to determine the likelihood of the diagnosis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although prior studies suggested women have worse outcomes after stroke, it is now clear that age, prestroke functional status, and comorbidities explain many of the differences between men and women in stroke severity, functional outcomes, and mortality. Several meta-analyses and large cohort studies have evaluated the risk factors for women related to reproductive factors and found that fewer years between menarche and menopause, pregnancy complications (preeclampsia/eclampsia, preterm delivery, and stillbirth), oophorectomy, hormone replacement therapy use, and younger age at menopause all increase the risk of stroke. Although the nonreproductive risks of stroke overlap between men and women, those with greater impact on women include age, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, socioeconomic status, and depression.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease that causes fluctuating weakness in ocular, bulbar, and limb muscles and can, in 15\% of cases, cause myasthenic crisis, a neurologic emergency characterized by respiratory failure. Although infrequent, MG needs to be promptly recognized and treated because the potential for improvement and remission is very high. The diagnosis of MG can be challenging and delayed because of the fluctuating nature of muscle weakness and the overlap of signs and symptoms with other neuromuscular diseases.               This article reviews the importance of prompt recognition of the typical signs and symptoms, best tests to confirm the diagnosis, currently available acute and chronic treatment modalities, the role of thymectomy, and the natural history of the disease. Special consideration related to the diagnosis and management in women during pregnancy and in children will also be reviewed. This article also includes an overview of congenital myasthenic syndromes.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent significant efforts in standardizing and improving the care of patients with MG have occurred, as well as new momentum in developing new drugs for patients with MG who do not adequately respond to currently available treatments. The number of clinical trials and drugs in development for MG is steadily increasing. Eculizumab has been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adult patients with generalized MG who are acetylcholine receptor--antibody positive, based on the REGAIN (Safety and Efficacy of Eculizumab in Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis) study, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. An international, multicenter, randomized trial comparing thymectomy plus prednisone with prednisone alone has demonstrated that thymectomy improves clinical outcome in patients with nonthymomatous MG. Clinical care guidelines have been published, and the recommendations for clinical research standards and the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America MGFA clinical classification published in 2000 have become widely accepted by the clinical and research community of MG experts.                                         SUMMARY               MG is a highly treatable disease with many effective treatment modalities available and with a natural history that continues to improve thanks to better diagnostic tests and effective drugs. The diagnosis and management of patients affected by MG can be highly rewarding for any neurologist as most patients are able to live normal lives if treated appropriately. Nevertheless, future research is needed to address unresolved clinical issues, such as when and how to discontinue immunosuppressive medications in patients in remission, the role and timing of thymectomy in children, and better treatment options for refractory patients.},

Over the past decade, advances in genetic testing have revolutionized patient evaluation. The main goal of this review is to give the clinician the basic understanding to recognize patients at risk of these diseases using the standard history and physical examination.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Primary mitochondrial disease                 is the current designation for the illnesses resulting from genetic mutations in genes whose protein products are necessary for mitochondrial structure or function. In most circumstances, more than one organ system is involved in mitochondrial disease, and the value of the classic clinical features as originally described early in the history of mitochondrial diseases has reemerged as being important to identifying patients who may have a primary mitochondrial disease. The use of the genetic laboratory has become the most powerful tool for confirming a diagnosis, and nuances of using genetic results will be discussed in this article. Treatment for mitochondrial disease is symptomatic, with less emphasis on vitamin and supplement therapy than in the past. Clinical trials using pharmacologic agents are in progress, with the field attempting to define proper goals of treatment. Several standard accepted therapies exist for many of the metabolic myopathies.                                                        SUMMARY               Mitochondrial, lipid, and glycogen diseases are not uncommon causes of multisystem organ dysfunction, with the neurologic features, especially myopathy, occurring as a predominant feature. Early recognition requires basic knowledge of the varied clinical phenotypes before moving forward with a screening evaluation and possibly a genetic evaluation. Aside from a few specific diseases for which there are recommended interventions, treatment for the majority of  these disorders remains symptomatic, with clinical trials currently in progress that will hopefully result in standard treatments.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Extracranial or intracranial large artery atherosclerosis is often identified as a potential etiologic cause for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. Given the high prevalence of large artery atherosclerosis in the general population, determining whether an identified atherosclerotic lesion is truly the cause of a patient's symptomatology can be difficult. In all cases, optimally treating each patient to minimize future stroke risk is paramount. Extracranial or intracranial large artery atherosclerosis can be broadly compartmentalized into four distinct clinical scenarios based upon the individual patient's history, examination, and anatomic imaging findings: asymptomatic and symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis, intracranial atherosclerosis, and extracranial vertebral artery atherosclerotic disease. This review provides a framework for clinicians evaluating and treating such patients.                                         Recent Findings:               Intensive medical therapy achieves low rates of stroke and death in asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Evidence indicates that patients with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis should undergo carotid revascularization sooner rather than later and that the risk of stroke or death is lower using carotid endarterectomy than with carotid stenting. Specific to stenting, the risk of stroke or death is greatest among older patients and women. Continuous vascular risk factor optimization via sustained behavioral modifications and intensive medical therapy is the mainstay for stroke prevention in the setting of intracranial and vertebral artery origin atherosclerosis.                                         Summary:               Lifelong vascular risk factor optimization via sustained behavioral modifications and intensive medical therapy are the key elements to reduce future stroke risk in the setting of large artery atherosclerosis. When considering a revascularization procedure for carotid stenosis, patient demographics, comorbidities, and the periprocedural risks of stroke and death should be carefully considered.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Disorders of thermoregulation and sweating may manifest with hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis/anhidrosis. Primary disorders of hyperhidrosis may significantly impact quality of life yet tend to be benign. Many sweating disorders present with compensatory hyperhidrosis due to areas of anhidrosis. Anhidrosis may occur due to either central or peripheral damage to the autonomic nervous system. The thermoregulatory control of sweating involves central pathways from the hypothalamus to the brainstem and then spinal cord as well as projections to peripheral structures, including the sympathetic chain ganglia, peripheral nerves, and eccrine sweat glands. Disruption at any point of this pathway may lead to impaired sweating. Characterization of sweating dysfunction helps localize different autonomic disorders to guide diagnosis and may allow for evaluation of treatment effect.                                         SUMMARY               Sweating dysfunction manifests in myriad ways, including essential hyperhidrosis, complete anhidrosis with heat intolerance, and compensatory hyperhidrosis due to anhidrosis, and often indicates involvement of underlying central or peripheral autonomic dysfunction.},

These disorders are not merely historical curiosities, however. As apraxia, neglect, and agnosia have important clinical implications, it is important to possess a working knowledge of the conditions and how to identify them.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Apraxia is a disorder of skilled action that is frequently observed in the setting of dominant hemisphere pathology, whether from stroke or neurodegenerative disorders. In contrast to some previous teaching, apraxia has clear clinical relevance as it is associated with poor recovery from stroke. Neglect is a complex disorder with many different manifestations that may have different underlying mechanisms. Neglect is, in the author's view, a multicomponent disorder in which impairment in attention and arousal is a major contributor. Finally, agnosias come in a wide variety of forms, reflecting impairments ranging from low-level sensory processing to access to stored knowledge of the world (semantics).                                         SUMMARY               The classic behavioral disorders reviewed here were of immense interest to early neurologists because of their arresting clinical phenomenology; more recent investigations have done much to advance the neuroscientific understanding of the disorders and to reveal their clinical relevance.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The discovery of the pathogenic aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG autoantibody and characterization of NMOSD as an autoimmune astrocytopathy have spearheaded the identification of key immunologic therapeutic targets in this disease, including but not limited to the complement system, the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, and B cells. Accordingly, four recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of three new NMOSD therapies, namely eculizumab, satralizumab, and inebilizumab.                                         SUMMARY               Currently, NMOSD poses both diagnostic and treatment challenges. It is debated whether individuals who are seropositive for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG belong within the neuromyelitis optica spectrum. This discussion is fueled by disparities in treatment responses between patients who are AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative, suggesting different immunopathologic mechanisms may govern these conditions. As our understanding regarding the immune pathophysiology of NMOSD expands, emerging biomarkers, including serum neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), may facilitate earlier relapse detection and inform long-term treatment decisions. Future research focal points should include strategies to optimize relapse management, restorative treatments that augment neurologic recovery, and practical solutions that promote equitable access to approved therapies for all patients with NMOSD.},

Recent Findings:               Up to a 10\% risk of recurrent stroke exists after a TIA, and up to 80\% of this risk is preventable with urgent assessment and treatment. Imaging of the brain and intracranial and extracranial blood vessels using CT, CT angiography, carotid Doppler ultrasound, and MRI is an important part of the diagnostic assessment.

These therapies contrast with acute stroke treatments such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and thrombectomy that target clots, aim to salvage threatened brain tissue to limit injury, and have a time window measured in hours. Restorative therapies target the brain, aim to promote plasticity within surviving brain tissue, and have a time window measured in days to weeks or longer.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               A number of drugs are under study. Preclinical studies are providing attractive therapeutic candidates for translation, such as the C-C chemokine receptor 5 inhibitor maraviroc. Some drug studies have used a pragmatic approach, which is premature for the nascent field of neural repair. Substantial data support the utility of activity-dependent therapies, including constraint-induced movement therapy, with recent studies supporting the need for very high doses to generate the best functional gains. While stem cell therapies are at an early stage, mounting preclinical evidence supports the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells; some initial human studies are supportive. Several types of brain stimulation have been examined, and in some cases initial studies are promising.

RECENT FINDINGS               The armamentarium of immunotherapies has grown rapidly, to encompass 19 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immunotherapies available in 2021, which are addressed in the review. The coronavirus pandemic that began in 2020 underscored existing concerns regarding vaccine efficacy in those treated with immune-suppressing immunotherapies, which are also addressed here.                                         SUMMARY               By choosing a treatment strategy before exploring the individual medications, patients and providers can focus their efforts on a subset of the therapeutic options. Although the mechanisms of action, routes of administration, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the described agents and classes differ, all are effective in reducing relapse frequency in multiple sclerosis (MS), with most also showing a reduction in the accumulation of neurologic disability. These powerful effects are improving the lives of people with MS. Pharmacovigilance is critical for the safe use of these immune-modulating and -suppressing agents, and vaccine efficacy may be reduced by those with immune-suppressing effects.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Although trigeminal neuralgia is well known to neurologists, recent developments in classification and clinical diagnosis, new MRI methods, and  a debate about surgical options necessitate an update on the topic.                                         Recent Findings:               Currently, a worldwide controversy exists regarding the classification, diagnostic process, and surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. This controversy has been caused on one side by the recognition that some 50\% of patients with trigeminal neuralgia, apart from characteristic paroxysmal attacks, also have continuous pain in the same territory, which results in greater diagnostic difficulties and is associated with a lower response to medical and surgical treatments. In contrast, recent developments in MRI methods allow differentiation between a mere neurovascular contact and an effective compression of the trigeminal root by an anomalous vessel, which implies more difficulties in the choice of surgical treatment, with the indication for microvascular decompression becoming more restricted.                                         Summary:               This article proposes that the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia, with or without concomitant continuous pain, must rely on clinical grounds only. Diagnostic tests are necessary to distinguish three etiologic categories: idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (nothing is found), classic trigeminal neuralgia (an anomalous vessel produces morphologic changes of the trigeminal root near its entry into the pons), and secondary trigeminal neuralgia (due to major neurologic disease, such as multiple sclerosis or tumors at the cerebellopontine angle). Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine (ie, voltage-gated, frequency-dependent sodium channel blockers) are still the first-choice medical treatment, although many patients experience significant side effects, and those with concomitant continuous pain respond less well to treatment. The development of sodium channel blockers that are selective for the sodium channel 1.7 (Na               v               1.7) receptor will hopefully help. Although all the surgical interventions (percutaneous ganglion lesions, gamma knife radiosurgery, and microvascular decompression) are very efficacious, precise MRI criteria for differentiating a real neurovascular compression from an irrelevant contact will be of benefit in better selecting patients for microvascular decompression.},

RECENT FINDINGS               POTS is a heterogeneous syndrome caused by several pathophysiologic mechanisms that may coexist (limited autonomic neuropathy, hyperadrenergic state, hypovolemia, venous pooling, joint hypermobility, deconditioning). Neurally mediated syncope occurs despite intact autonomic reflexes. Management of orthostatic intolerance aims to increase functional capacity, including standing time, performance of daily activities, and exercise tolerance. Nonpharmacologic strategies (fluid and salt loading, physical countermaneuvers, compression garments, exercise training) are fundamental for patients with POTS, occasionally complemented by medications to raise blood pressure or slow heart rate. Neurally mediated syncope is best managed by recognition and avoidance of triggers.

Bacterial meningitis is usually lethal unless appropriate antibiotics that cross the blood-brain barrier are given. Clinical suspicion of bacterial meningitis begins when patients present with the abrupt onset of fever, headache, and meningismus.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               New technologies are being developed for more rapid identification of the bacterial species causing meningitis. When appropriate, administration of adjunctive dexamethasone with the antibiotics often lessens neurologic sequelae in survivors, which may include aphasia, ataxia, paresis, hearing loss, and cognitive impairment.                                         SUMMARY               Confirmation of the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis comes mainly from examination and culture of CSF obtained from a lumbar puncture. Typically, the CSF shows an elevated neutrophil count, elevated protein, depressed glucose, positive Gram stain, and growth of the bacteria on appropriate culture media. Antibiotic sensitivities of the bacteria determine the appropriate antibiotics, although an educated guess of the best antibiotics to be given promptly must be made until the antibiotic sensitivities return, usually in a few days.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Substantial variability exists in the presenting features and clinical course of patients with common neurodegenerative causes of dementia, but the response to available therapies and eventual outcomes are often poor. This realization has influenced the evaluation of patients with dementia, with diagnostic approaches emphasizing routine screening for a short list of potentially modifiable disorders that may exacerbate dementia symptoms or severity but rarely influence long-term outcomes. Although a standard approach to the assessment of dementia is appropriate in the vast majority of cases, neurologists involved in the assessment of patients with dementia must recognize those rare patients with reversible causes of dementia, coordinate additional investigations when required, and ensure expedited access to treatments that may reverse decline and optimize long-term outcomes.

These disorders commonly occur in head trauma, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases such as idiopathic Parkinson disease and dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer disease, just to name a few. This article covers the basic anatomy of smell and taste, notes the important points of taking a proper history, and discusses smell and taste testing, which are inexpensive, minimally time-consuming procedures. Recurrent bad smells and tastes are not uncommon in these disorders, which cause major impairment in quality of life, including loss of appetite, decreased eating, and weight loss. The diagnosis and treatment of these disorders will also be discussed.                                         Recent Findings:               Despite past widespread negative prognoses of taste and smell disorders, more recent work in the last 10 years has shown an improved prognosis for smell and taste recovery in most disorders, and recommendations for changes in food preparation have helped many patients enjoy their food and increase their appetite. Recent experimental evidence has shown that smell loss and testing can assist in separating idiopathic Parkinson disease from other parkinsonian syndromes, can suggest which patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder will more likely develop Parkinson disease, and can be predictive of the progression of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer dementia.                                         Summary:               This article discusses the common smell and taste disorders that a clinical neurologist will encounter in practice. The anatomy and function of smell and taste will be reviewed, followed by office evaluation and testing. The common disorders will be reviewed, along with their prognosis and management.},

An anatomic approach is used; diseases of the extradural, intradural-extramedullary, and intramedullary (parenchymal) compartments are considered, and both neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions are covered. Differentiating imaging features are highlighted.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although T2-hyperintense signal abnormality of the spinal cord can have myriad etiologies, neuroimaging can provide specific diagnoses or considerably narrow the differential diagnosis in many cases. Intradural-extramedullary lesions compressing the spinal cord have a limited differential diagnosis and are usually benign; meningiomas and schwannomas are most common. Extradural lesions can often be specifically diagnosed. Disk herniations are the most commonly encountered mass of the epidural space. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy can cause a characteristic pattern of enhancement, which may be mistaken for an intrinsic myelopathy. A do-not-miss diagnosis of the extradural compartment is idiopathic spinal cord herniation, the appearance of which can overlap with arachnoid cysts and webs. Regarding intrinsic causes of myelopathy, the lesions of multiple sclerosis are characteristically short segment but can be confluent when multiple. Postcontrast MRI can be particularly helpful, including when attempting to differentiate the long-segment myelopathy of neurosarcoidosis and aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG--seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and when characterizing spinal cord tumors such as primary neoplasms and metastases. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula is another do-not-miss diagnosis, with characteristic MRI features both precontrast and postcontrast. Tract-specific white matter involvement can be a clue for diseases such as subacute combined degeneration, paraneoplastic myelopathy, and radiation myelitis, whereas gray matter--specific involvement can suggest conditions such as cord infarct, viral myelitis, or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG associated disorder.                                         SUMMARY               Knowledge of the neuroimaging findings of the many causes of spinal cord and cauda equina dysfunction is critical for both neurologists and neuroradiologists. A structured approach to lesion compartmental location and imaging feature characterization is recommended.},

Many gastrointestinal disorders are associated with neurologic disease through nutritional, immune-mediated, or degenerative pathophysiologies. This article reviews neurologic disorders in patients with gastrointestinal disease and gastrointestinal manifestations in their own neurologic patients.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS                                Development of new gastric and bariatric surgical procedures and the widespread use of over-the-counter gastric acid--reducing medications continue to create vitamin and nutritional deficiencies despite modern diet and supplementation. Some supplements, such as vitamin A, vitamin B                 6                 , and selenium, themselves are now found to cause disease. Recent work has shown extraintestinal and neurologic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. Chronic brain damage in liver disease has been recognized, and the opportunity to intervene may exist in the covert beginning stages. The characterization of gluten-related neurologic symptoms and differentiation from those of celiac disease is an evolving body of work.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               Gastrointestinal and neurologic diseases related to common immune-mediated, degenerative, or infectious mechanisms are common and can coexist in the same patient. Furthermore, gastrointestinal disease may cause neurologic complications because of nutritional inadequacies, malabsorption, and hepatic dysfunction. In many cases, the complications are treatable but have subtle or protean presentations. Therefore, the consulting neurologist must be current in knowledge of the growing ties between gastrointestinal and neurologic disease.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cancer therapies can cause a wide range of neurologic adverse effects and may result in significant patient morbidity and mortality. Although some treatment-associated neurologic complications manifest acutely and are often reversible and transient, others occur with delayed onset, can be progressive, and are uniquely challenging to patient management. With an increase in multimodality and combination therapies, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies, and prolonged patient survival, novel and unique patterns of neurologic complications have emerged.

Recent Findings:               GBS is an acute/subacute-onset polyradiculoneuropathy typically presenting with sensory symptoms and weakness over several days, often leading to quadriparesis. Approximately 70\% of patients report a recent preceding upper or lower respiratory tract infection or gastrointestinal illness. Approximately 30\% of patients require intubation and ventilation because of respiratory failure. Nerve conduction studies in the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) form of GBS typically show evidence for a multifocal demyelinating process, including conduction block or temporal dispersion in motor nerves. Sural sparing is a common phenomenon when testing sensory nerves. CSF analysis commonly shows an elevated protein, but this elevation may not be present until the third week of the illness. Patients with AIDP are treated with best medical management and either IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange.                                         Summary:               GBS is a common form of acute quadriparesis; a high level of suspicion is needed for early diagnosis.

RECENT FINDINGS               Muscle symptoms are common among statin users and are usually reversible after discontinuation of the statin; rarely, however, statins trigger an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy that persists and requires immunomodulatory therapy. Autoantibodies targeting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase can distinguish the toxic and immune-mediated forms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, increasingly used in the treatment of advanced cancer, have recently been associated with the development of inflammatory myositis. A reversible mitochondrial myopathy has long been associated with zidovudine, but recent reports elucidate the risk of myopathy with newer antivirals, such as telbivudine and raltegravir.                                         SUMMARY               The medications most commonly associated with myopathy include statins, amiodarone, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, certain antivirals, and corticosteroids, and myopathy can occur with chronic alcoholism. Certain clinical, electrodiagnostic, and histologic features can aid in early recognition. Stopping the use of the offending agent reverses symptoms in most cases, but specific and timely treatment may be required in cases related to agents that trigger immune-mediated muscle injury.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Conditions causing recurrent spontaneous episodes of dizziness or vertigo span several medical specialties, making it challenging for clinicians to gain confidence in evaluating and managing the spectrum of episodic vestibular disorders. Patients are often asymptomatic and have normal examinations at the time of evaluation. Thus, diagnosis depends heavily on eliciting key features from the history. Overreliance on symptom quality descriptions commonly leads to misdiagnosis. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with a straightforward approach to the diagnosis and management of conditions that cause episodic spontaneous dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS: Consensus diagnostic criteria have been established for vestibular migraine, M{\'e}ni{\`e}re disease, vestibular paroxysmia, and hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo. Vertigo has been recognized as a common symptom in vertebrobasilar ischemia, cardiogenic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. Treatment recommendations for vestibular migraine still lack high-quality evidence, but controlled trials are occurring. SUMMARY: The evaluation should start with a detailed description of the episodes from the patient and any observers. Rather than focusing first on whether the symptom quality is most consistent with vertigo, dizziness, lightheadedness, or unsteadiness, the clinician should clarify the timing (episode frequency and duration), possible triggers or circumstances (eg, position changes, upright posture), and accompanying symptoms. History should identify any auditory symptoms, migraine features, posterior circulation ischemic symptoms, vascular risk factors, clues for anxiety, and potentially relevant medications. Carefully selected testing can help secure the diagnosis, but excessive and indiscriminate testing can lead to more confusion. Treatments for these conditions are vastly different, so an accurate diagnosis is critical.},

The importance and sequelae of lifetime trauma burden are discussed, with reference to trends in prevention, early intervention, and treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                PTSD has different clinical phenotypes, which are reflected in the changes in                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 (                 DSM-5                 ) criteria. PTSD is almost always complicated by comorbidity. Treatment requires a multimodal approach, usually including medication, different therapeutic techniques, and management of comorbidity. Interest is growing in the neurobiology of childhood survivors of trauma, intergenerational transmission of trauma, and long-term impact of trauma on physical health. Mitigation of the risk of PTSD pretrauma in the military and first responders is gaining momentum, given concerns about the cost and disability associated with PTSD. Interest is also growing in screening for PTSD in medical populations, with evidence of improved clinical outcomes. Preliminary research supports the treatment of PTSD with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.                                                        SUMMARY               PTSD is a trauma-related disorder with features of fear and negative thinking about the trauma and the future. Untreated, it leads to ongoing disruption of life due to avoidance, impaired vocational and social functioning, and other symptoms, depending on the phenotype. Despite a theoretical understanding of underlying mechanisms, PTSD remains challenging to treat, although evidence exists for benefit of pharmacologic agents and trauma-focused therapies. A need still remains for treatments that are more effective and efficient, with faster onset.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Two important changes have been made to the recent                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 (                 DSM-5                 ) diagnostic criteria: the criteria that conversion symptoms must be shown to be involuntary and occurring as the consequence of a recent stressor have been dropped. Outcome studies show that the rate of misdiagnosis has declined precipitously since the 1970s and is now around 4\%. Functional neuroimaging has revealed a fairly consistent pattern of hypoactivation in brain regions linked to the specific conversion symptom, accompanied by ancillary activations in limbic, paralimbic, and basal ganglia structures. Cognitive-behavioral therapy looks promising as the psychological treatment of choice, although more definitive data are still awaited, while preliminary evidence indicates that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation could prove beneficial as well.                                                        SUMMARY               Symptoms of conversion are common in neurologic and psychiatric settings, affecting up to 20\% of patients. The full syndrome of conversion disorder, while less prevalent, is associated with a guarded prognosis and a troubled psychosocial outcome. Much remains uncertain with respect to etiology, although advances in neuroscience and technology are providing reproducible findings and new insights. Given the confidence with which the diagnosis can be made, treatment should not be delayed, as symptom longevity can influence outcome.},

RECENT FINDINGS               As updated methods become available to neurologists, the ability to accurately identify and treat patients with memory disorders evolves. An appreciation of current concepts in the anatomic, physiologic, and psychological aspects of memory, combined with a rational application of everyday tools (such as clinical examination, bedside testing, standardized cognitive screening, and formal neuropsychological examination), allows the clinician to identify possible etiologies and track longitudinal changes in functional memory status. Recent findings regarding the interactions of limbic, anterior temporal, primary sensory, parietal, and dorsal prefrontal structures shed new light on the putative classifications of procedural and declarative memory and their subfunctions.

This older approach can lead to misdiagnosis, so a preferred method puts greater emphasis on whether the dizziness is acute or chronic, episodic or continuous, or evoked by or brought on by an event or circumstance so that a pattern may be derived that better narrows the differential diagnosis and focused examination can further narrow to a cause or causes.

Recent Findings:               Improved methods of diagnosing patients with vertigo and dizziness have been evolving, including additional diagnostic criteria and characterization of some common conditions that cause dizziness (eg, vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, chronic subjective dizziness). Other uncommon causes of dizziness (eg, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, episodic ataxia type 2) have also been better clarified. Distinguishing between central and peripheral causes of vertigo can be accomplished reliably through history and examination, but imaging techniques have further added to accuracy. What has not changed is the necessity of obtaining a basic history of the patient's symptoms to narrow the list of possible causes.                                         Summary:               Dizziness and vertigo are extremely common symptoms that also affect function at home and at work.

RECENT FINDINGS               Gene therapies have become a reality for several neuromuscular disorders. Exon-skipping and (in Europe) ribosomal read-through approaches are currently available to a subset of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Microdystrophin gene replacement has shown promise and is nearing the final stages of clinical trials. Numerous gene-based therapies for other muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are progressing toward approval as well.                                         SUMMARY               Muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are a heterogenous group of hereditary muscle disorders. Confirming a diagnosis with genetic testing is not only critical for guiding management, but also an actual prerequisite for current and future gene therapies. Recessive loss-of-function or dominant haploinsufficiency disorders may be treated with gene replacement strategies, whereas dominant negative and toxic gain-of-function disorders are best addressed with a variety of knockdown approaches. It is important to recognize that many therapeutics are mutation specific and will only benefit a subset of individuals with a specific disease.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Rather than a disease, a disease process, or relating to specific cellular vulnerability, the term                 hereditary myelopathy                 refers to diverse inherited disorders in which major aspects of the clinical syndrome reflect disturbance of elements within the spinal cord (specifically, the dorsal columns and dorsal root ganglia, corticospinal tracts, and anterior horn cells). It is important to note that the clinical features of almost all hereditary myelopathies reflect not only disturbance of elements within the spinal cord but also disturbance of extraspinal structures (particularly, but not limited to, peripheral nerves and the cerebellum) and that these extraspinal clinical features can be very helpful in recognizing specific myelopathy syndromes. The value of classifying disorders as inherited myelopathies lies primarily in facilitating their clinical recognition and differential diagnosis. It is useful to recognize that many hereditary myelopathies conform to one of four clinical paradigms: (1) spinocerebellar ataxia, (2) motor neuron disorder, (3) leukodystrophy, or (4) distal motor-sensory axonopathy predominantly affecting the central nervous system. Although they are myelopathies, spinal dysraphisms such as spina bifida and myelomeningocele are not included in this context because they are not usually due to single-gene mutation and have low hereditability.

This article also provides an overview of the emerging clinical scenarios in which paraneoplastic and autoimmune neurologic disorders may occur.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The number of autoantibodies associated with paraneoplastic neurologic disorders has rapidly expanded over the past 2 decades. These discoveries have improved our ability to diagnose patients with these disorders and have provided insight into their pathogenesis. It is now recognized that these antibodies can be broadly divided into two major categories based on the location of the target antigen: intracellular and cell surface/synaptic. Antibodies to intracellular antigens are almost always accompanied by cancer, respond less well to immunotherapy, and have an unfavorable outcome. In contrast, antibodies to cell surface or synaptic targets are less often accompanied by cancer, generally respond well to immunotherapy, and have a good prognosis. Paraneoplastic and autoimmune neurologic disorders are now being recognized in novel settings, including their occurrence as an immune-related adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for cancer.                                         SUMMARY               This article discusses when to suspect a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome, the diagnostic utility and pitfalls of neural autoantibody testing, how to best detect the underlying tumor, and the treatment approach that involves combinations of antineoplastic treatments, immunosuppressants, and supportive/symptomatic treatments.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Unruptured intracranial aneurysms and vascular malformations are detected more frequently because of the increased use and availability of brain imaging. Management of these entities requires knowledge of which patients are at high risk for hemorrhage and what treatment options are available. This article summarizes the epidemiology, natural history, and management strategies for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations, developmental venous anomalies, and capillary telangiectasias.                                         Recent Findings:               Pooled cohort studies and meta-analyses have improved the ability to predict hemorrhage for each vascular abnormality. Scores and tools have been developed to aid the practitioner in predicting hemorrhage risk for unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Advances in endovascular techniques for unruptured intracranial aneurysms have improved the ability to treat difficult wide-necked aneurysms.                                         Summary:               Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are a common incidental finding. The PHASES (population, hypertension, age, size of aneurysm, earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage from another aneurysm, site of aneurysm) score and Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysm Treatment Score may be useful tools for predicting natural history and treatment recommendations. The overall risk of hemorrhage for both arteriovenous malformations and cavernous malformations is about 2\% to 4\% per year. With both of these entities, prior hemorrhage predicts future hemorrhage. In addition, other select patient and radiologic factors influence risk of hemorrhage. The risk of future hemorrhage should be compared to the risk of treatment. Developmental venous anomalies and capillary telangiectasias are largely benign entities and rarely symptomatic.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Patients with primary malignant brain tumors generally have a poor prognosis and experience progressive neurologic decline and significant physical and psychological symptoms. Management of these symptoms, including fatigue, mood disorders, and the manifestations of cerebral edema, can be challenging. Caregivers for these patients have high rates of psychological distress and report significant caregiving burden. Although the benefit of early palliative care for patients with other advanced solid tumors is well established, our understanding of the role of palliative care in neuro-oncology is incomplete, and thus palliative care and hospice services remain underutilized.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with brain tumors and their caregivers have significant supportive care needs, which often differ from the needs of patients with cancers outside of the nervous system. Clinicians face challenges associated with managing patients' symptoms and adequately facilitating prognostic understanding and decision making.

Survivors of childhood stroke and their families are often left to cope with long-lasting sequelae, such as barriers to school reentry and long-term challenges in attaining independence as adults. Because childhood stroke is rare and providers may not be familiar with the disorder, this article reviews the risk factors, acute management, and sequelae of ischemic stroke in children.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               High-quality evidence has resulted in an organized approach to emergent treatment of ischemic stroke in adults, but most front-line providers are less prepared for emergent stroke management in children. The level of evidence for reperfusion therapies in children remains low but is growing. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy are sometimes considered for hyperacute treatment of stroke in children. Readiness for pediatric stroke at regional centers should include an organized approach to pediatric stroke triage and management based on extrapolation from adult stroke trials, expert consensus, and emerging pediatric studies.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               This review provides up-to-date information about ischemic stroke risk factors and management in children. Preparation for rapid stroke diagnosis and management in children may improve outcomes.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Headache disorders attributed to low and high intracranial pressure are commonly encountered in specialty headache practices and may occur more frequently than realized. While the headaches resulting from intracranial pressure disorders have what are conventionally thought of as defining characteristics, a substantial minority of patients do not manifest the ``typical'' features. Moreover, patients with intracranial pressure disorders may also have a preexisting primary headache disorder. Heightening the complexity of the presentation, the headaches of intracranial pressure disorders can resemble the phenotype of a primary disorder. Lastly, patients with so-called intracranial ``hypotension'' often have normal CSF pressure and neuroimaging studies. Thus, a high index of suspicion is needed. The published literature has inherent bias as many types of specialists evaluate and treat these conditions. This article reviews the key points to emphasize the history, examination, and laboratory evaluation of patients with intracranial pressure disorders from a neurologist's perspective.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Lumbar puncture opening pressure in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension was low enough to meet diagnostic criteria ({$\leq$}60 mm CSF) in only 34\% of patients in one study. Most patients had an opening pressure in the low normal to normal range, and 5\% had an opening pressure of 200 mm CSF or more. Diskogenic microspurs are a common cause of this syndrome. The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial found that most participants had a headache phenotype resembling migraine or tension-type headache. No ``typical'' or characteristic headache phenotype was found, and headache-related disability was severe at baseline. Headache disability did not correlate with the lumbar puncture opening pressure at baseline or at the 6-month primary outcome period. Although participants who were randomly assigned to acetazolamide had a lower mean CSF opening pressure at 6 months, headache disability in that group was similar to the group who received placebo.                                         SUMMARY               Significant overlap is seen in the symptoms of high and low CSF pressure disorders and in those of primary headache disorders. Neurologists are frequently challenged by patients with headaches who lack the typical clinical signs or imaging features of the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome or spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Even when characteristic symptoms and signs are initially present, the typical features of both syndromes tend to lessen or resolve over time; consider these diagnoses in patients with long-standing ``chronic migraine'' who do not improve with conventional headache treatment. While the diagnostic criteria for pseudotumor cerebri syndrome accurately identify most patients with the disorder, at least 25\% of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension have normal imaging and over half have a normal lumbar puncture opening pressure. Detailed history taking will often give clues that suggest a CSF pressure disorder. That said, misdiagnosis can lead to significant patient morbidity and inappropriate therapy.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The major advance in the field of tardive syndromes has been the development and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of two vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, for treating tardive syndromes. These medications are derivatives of tetrabenazine and reduce dyskinetic movements by reducing dopamine stimulation. Treatment is not curative, and the medications reduce, or ``mask,'' symptoms but presumably without adding to the long-term risk of increased involuntary movements believed to accrue from suppressive treatment with dopamine receptor--blocking drugs. A confounding advance has been the accumulation of data finding that second-generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics, may not be safer than first-generation antipsychotics in causing tardive syndromes. The public health risk of tardive syndromes may actually have increased as some second-generation antipsychotics, widely promoted to both doctors and patients, are increasingly used as antidepressants.                                         SUMMARY               Tardive syndromes remain a public health risk. Second-generation antipsychotics have not been proven to have less risk than first-generation drugs in causing tardive syndromes and are nevertheless being used more widely to treat depression, bipolar disease, and insomnia. Symptomatic treatment for tardive syndromes is available, although expensive.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Major advances have occurred in recognizing the genetic basis of nervous system malformations. Environmental causes of nervous system malformations, such as perinatal infections including Zika virus, are also reviewed. Treatment for nervous system malformations begins prior to birth with prevention. Folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of neural tube defects and is an important part of health maintenance for pregnant women. Fetal surgery is now available for prenatal repair of myelomeningocele and has been demonstrated to improve outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Each type of nervous system malformation is relatively uncommon, but, collectively, they constitute a large population of neurologic patients. The diagnosis of nervous system malformations begins with radiographic characterization. Genetic studies, including chromosomal microarray, targeted gene sequencing, and next-generation sequencing, are increasingly important aspects of the assessment. A genetic diagnosis may identify an associated medical condition and is necessary for family planning. Treatment consists primarily of supportive therapies for developmental delays and epilepsy, but prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele offers a glimpse of future possibilities. Prognosis depends on multiple clinical factors, including the examination findings, imaging characteristics, and genetic results. Treatment is best conducted in a multidisciplinary setting with neurology, neurosurgery, developmental pediatrics, and genetics working together as a comprehensive team.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Parasitic infections in humans are common, and many can affect the central nervous system where they may survive unnoticed or may cause significant pathology that can even lead to the death of the host.

SUMMARY               Cerebral malaria is a significant cause of mortality, particularly in African children, in whom infected red blood cells affect the cerebral vessels, causing severe encephalopathy. Neurocysticercosis is the most common cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide and has varied clinical presentations, depending on the number, size, and location of the parasites in the nervous system as well as on the host's inflammatory response. Toxoplasmosis is distributed worldwide, affecting a significant proportion of the population, and may reactivate in patients who are immunosuppressed, causing encephalitis and focal abscesses.

RECENT FINDINGS               Four triptans are now labeled by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acute migraine treatment in adolescents, and rizatriptan is labeled for use in children age 6 and older. For preventive migraine treatment, the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention trial demonstrated that approximately 60\% of children and adolescents with migraine will improve with a three-pronged treatment approach that includes: (1) lifestyle management counseling (on sleep, exercise, hydration, caffeine, and avoidance of meal skipping); (2) optimally dosed acute therapy, specifically nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans; and (3) a preventive treatment that has some evidence for efficacy. For the remaining 40\% of children and adolescents, and for those who would not have qualified for the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention trial because of having continuous headache or medication-overuse headache, the clinician's judgment remains the best guide to preventive therapy selection.                                         SUMMARY               Randomized placebo-controlled trials have been conducted to guide first-line acute and preventive migraine treatments in children and adolescents. Future research is needed to guide treatment for those with more refractory migraine, as well as for children and adolescents who have other primary headache disorders.},

Oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, accelerated arteriosclerosis, and uremic inflammatory milieu affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. This article reviews the unique contributions of renal impairment to neurologic disorders and their common clinical manifestations as the prevalence of renal disease increases in a globally aging population.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENT                                Advances in the understanding of the pathophysiologic interplay between the kidneys and brain, also referred to as the                 kidney-brain axis                 , have led to more widespread recognition of associated changes in neurovascular dynamics, central nervous system acidification, and uremia-associated endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Acute kidney injury increases mortality in acute brain injury to nearly 5 times that seen in matched controls. Renal impairment and its associated increased risks of intracerebral hemorrhage and accelerated cognitive decline are developing fields. Dialysis-associated neurovascular injury is increasingly recognized in both continuous and intermittent forms of renal replacement therapy, and treatment strategies for its prevention are evolving.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               This article summarizes the effects of renal impairment on the central and peripheral nervous systems with special considerations in acute kidney injury, patients requiring dialysis, and conditions that affect both the renal and nervous systems.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Despite the ubiquity of anxiety, the evidence is that most individuals with an anxiety disorder are not identified and do not receive guideline-level care. In part, this may be because of the manifold clinical presentations of anxiety disorders and clinicians' lack of confidence in accurately diagnosing and treating these conditions, especially in nonpsychiatric settings. Anxiety disorders represent the complex interplay between biological, psychological, temperamental, and environmental factors. Converging lines of evidence point to dysfunction in regulating activity in the ``threat circuit'' in the brain as a putative common pathophysiology underlying anxiety disorders. Evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressant medications, have been shown to regulate activity in this circuit, which consists of reciprocal connections between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and amygdala.                                         SUMMARY               Anxiety disorders are the most common class of emotional disorders and a leading cause of disability worldwide. A variety of effective treatment strategies are available, which may exert their therapeutic benefits from top-down or bottom-up modulation of the dysfunctional brain activity associated with anxiety disorders.},

The standard methodology for completing a skin biopsy, the anatomic structures of interest detected within a skin biopsy, and the disease states in which skin biopsies may provide valuable information are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Several recent advances in the studies of hereditary amyloidosis and the various degenerative synucleinopathies have demonstrated that simple skin biopsies can provide valuable pathologic evidence of neurologic disease. In addition to diagnosis of the underlying disorder, skin biopsies provide a quantitative structural measurement of the associated autonomic damage.                                         SUMMARY               Skin biopsies are making great inroads into the study of autonomic and peripheral nerve disorders. Complex immunohistochemical staining protocols are challenging to complete, but the rich data derived from these studies in the diagnosis and monitoring of different disease states suggest that the role of skin biopsies in the study of the autonomic nervous system will continue to expand in the years to come.},

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of neurologic complications of COVID-19 began to surface. A variety of neurologic conditions have since been reported in association with COVID-19. Understanding of the underlying mechanism of COVID-19 neurologic involvement continues to evolve; however, the evidence seems to suggest that aberrant inflammatory responses may play a role. In addition to neurologic symptoms in acute COVID-19, neurologic post--COVID-19 conditions are increasingly recognized. The development of COVID-19 vaccines has been essential in preventing the spread of COVID-19. With increasing numbers of vaccine doses administered, various neurologic adverse events have been reported.

The etiology is most often global hypoxia-ischemia due to failure of cerebral perfusion to the fetus caused by uterine, placental, or umbilical cord compromise prior to or during delivery. Other etiologies of neonatal encephalopathy include ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, infection, developmental anomalies, and inborn errors of metabolism.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Therapeutic hypothermia is standard of care for the treatment of neonatal encephalopathy presumed to be caused by hypoxia-ischemia. The number needed to treat is approximately 6 to 7 to prevent one child from either death or disability at age 18 to 22 months. EEG monitoring and MRI are important tools in determining the etiology of encephalopathy and prognosis of the infant.                                         SUMMARY               Neonatal encephalopathy is a heterogeneous disorder that is characterized by alterations in mental status, hypotonia, seizures, and abnormalities in feeding and respiration. The most common cause of neonatal encephalopathy is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, for which treatment with 72 hours of therapeutic hypothermia is associated with reduced death or disability.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Our understanding of memory formation advances each year. Successful episodic memory formation depends not only on intact medial temporal lobe structures but also on well-orchestrated interactions with other large-scale brain networks that support executive and semantic processing functions. Recent discoveries of cognitive control networks have helped in understanding the interaction between memory systems and executive systems. These interactions allow access to past experiences and enable comparisons between past experiences and external and internal information. The semantic memory system is less clearly defined anatomically. Anterior, lateral, and inferior temporal lobe regions appear to play a crucial role in the function of the semantic processing system. Different but tightly interconnected cortical regions, such as the prefrontal region, may play a controlling role in this system. The presentation of clinical disease affecting memory is the result of the selective vulnerability of the memory system. An understanding of current concepts of memory anatomy, physiology, and evaluation plays a central role in establishing an accurate diagnosis.                                         SUMMARY               Different memory systems rely on separate but overlapping distributed brain networks. Certain pathologic processes preferentially affect memory systems. An understanding of memory formation stages will enable more accurate diagnosis.},

Moreover, while some causes of diplopia are benign, others require immediate recognition, a focused diagnostic evaluation, and appropriate treatment to prevent vision- and life-threatening outcomes. A logical, easy-to-follow approach to the clinical evaluation of patients with diplopia is helpful in ensuring accurate localization, a comprehensive differential diagnosis, and optimal patient care. This article provides a foundation for formulating an approach to the patient with diplopia and includes practical examples of developing the differential diagnosis, effectively using confirmatory examination techniques, determining an appropriate diagnostic strategy, and (where applicable) providing effective treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent population-based analyses have determined that diplopia is a common presentation in both ambulatory and emergency department settings, with 850,000 such visits occurring annually. For patients presenting to an outpatient facility, diagnoses are rarely serious. However, potentially life-threatening causes (predominantly stroke or transient ischemic attack) can be encountered. In patients presenting with diplopia related to isolated cranial nerve palsy, immediate neuroimaging can often be avoided if an appropriate history and examination are used to exclude worrisome etiologies.                                         SUMMARY               Binocular diplopia is most often due to a neurologic cause. The onset of true ``double vision'' is debilitating for most patients and commonly prompts immediate access to health care services as a consequence of functional impairment and concern for worrisome underlying causes. Although patients may seek initial evaluation through the emergency department or from their primary care/ophthalmic provider, elimination of an ocular cause will not infrequently result in the patient being referred for neurologic consultation. A logical, localization-driven, and evidence-based approach is the most effective way to arrive at the correct diagnosis and provide the best outcome for the patient.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive and motor syndromes are often intertwined in neurologic disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease, atypical parkinsonian syndromes, Huntington disease, and other movement disorders. Cognitive symptoms often affect attention, working memory, and executive and visuospatial functions preferentially, rather than language and memory, but heterogeneity can be seen in the various movement disorders. A distinct cognitive syndrome has been recognized in patients with cerebellar syndromes. Appropriate recognition and screening for cognitive changes in movement disorders may play a role in achieving accurate diagnoses and guiding patients and their families regarding progression and management decisions.                                         SUMMARY               In the comprehensive care of patients with movement disorders, recognition of cognitive syndromes is important. Pharmacologic treatments for the cognitive syndromes, including mild cognitive impairment and dementia, in these movement disorders lag behind the therapeutics available for motor symptoms, and more research is needed.

This article reviews cauda equina anatomy, the diagnostic approach to disorders of the cauda equina, features of cauda equina syndrome, and diskogenic and nondiskogenic disorders of the cauda equina.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Establishing clinical criteria for cauda equina syndrome has been a focus of a number of reviews, although the clinician must maintain a low threshold for emergent imaging in cases of suspected cauda equina syndrome because of the suboptimal reliability of various signs and symptoms in identifying this condition clinically. The timing of surgical intervention for compressive causes of cauda equina dysfunction remains a point of contention, although urgent decompression remains standard practice. A recent review that focused on outcomes in patients with cauda equina compression who underwent surgical decompression identified significant residual deficits in patients despite appropriate and timely intervention.

Diagnostic considerations and therapeutic options for individual diseases are also discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Paraneoplastic syndromes can affect the afferent and efferent visual systems. Paraneoplastic syndromes may result in reduced visual acuity from retinal degeneration, alterations in melanocyte proliferation and uveal thickening, or acquired nystagmus. Ocular motor abnormalities related to paraneoplastic syndromes may present with symptoms from opsoclonus or from neuromuscular junction disease. Diagnosis remains challenging, but serologic identification of some specific antibodies may be helpful or confirmatory. Treatment, in addition to directed therapies against the underlying cancer, often requires systemic corticosteroids, plasma exchange, or immunosuppression, but some specific syndromes improve with use of targeted pharmacologic therapy.                                         SUMMARY               Diagnosis and therapy of paraneoplastic syndromes presenting with neuro-ophthalmic symptoms remain a challenge, but strategies are evolving and new approaches are on the horizon.},

The spectrum of motor neuron diseases is reviewed, and the clinical heterogeneity of ALS is described.                                         Recent Findings:               ALS is increasingly recognized as a clinical spectrum disorder with pure upper and pure lower motor neuron presentations, supported by genetic links. The phenotypic variability is broad. Identification of ALS-related genes provides insights into disease mechanisms.                                         Summary:               ALS is a progressive fatal multisystem neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Clinical recognition of suspicious symptoms and the appropriate laboratory evaluation are essential to limit diagnostic delay and avoid unnecessary testing and procedures. ALS has broad genetic and hypothesized environmental causes and phenotypic variability. Recognizing related motor neuron diseases will prevent misdiagnosis while allowing proper disease counseling. Although ALS cannot be cured, implementation of appropriate symptomatic treatment is valuable.},

RECENT FINDINGS               IBM is an often-misdiagnosed myopathy subtype. Due to the insidious onset and slow progression of muscle weakness, it can often be dismissed as a sign of aging as it commonly presents in older adults. While challenging to recognize upon initial clinical evaluation, the recent recognition of specialized stains highlighting features seen on muscle pathology, the use of diagnostic tools such as the anti-cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A antibody biomarker, and the ability of muscle imaging to detect patterns of preferential muscle involvement seen in IBM has allowed for earlier diagnosis of the disease than was previously possible. While the pathogenesis of IBM has historically been poorly understood, several ongoing studies point toward mechanisms of autophagy and highly differentiated cytotoxic T cells that are postulated to be pathogenic in IBM.

New studies have shed light on its epidemiology and pathogenesis and provided objective ways to measure outcome in patients with NPH. Neuroimaging has improved and allows better recognition of both NPH and the presence of overlapping diseases                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Several recent epidemiologic studies confirm that NPH is a rare disease, but the presence of large ventricles is a common finding with aging. NPH may be multifactorial, including congenital causes, vascular disease, and impaired CSF absorption. MRI features of NPH include enlarged ventricular size and CSF fluid collection outside the ventricles not due to atrophy. The term                 disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus                 (DESH) has been used to describe prognostic MRI features in NPH, including a ``tight high convexity'' and enlargement of CSF spaces in the sylvian fissure. DESH has been included in the Japanese guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of NPH. A new NPH scale has been published that provides an objective framework for evaluating patients with NPH before and after shunt placement. Programmable shunts can noninvasively manage overdrainage complications. Surgical outcome has been improving over time. Recent studies have led to improved recognition of overlapping diseases such as Alzheimer pathology, which co-occurs in about 30\% of NPH cases. Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a promising imaging modality for diagnosing NPH and detecting concomitant degenerative disease.                                                        SUMMARY               A systematic approach to patients with possible NPH allows recognition of the subset of patients who will respond to shunt surgery and identification of those with alternative diagnoses.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cerebrovascular disease is a common cause of dementia and frequently coexists with neurodegenerative causes. The heterogeneity of mechanisms leading to vascular cognitive impairment makes developing unifying clinical and research criteria difficult. Recognizing the neuroimaging hallmarks of different forms of vascular cognitive impairment can allow for individualized treatment and management. In individuals with mild vascular cognitive impairment, aerobic exercise appears to be a promising treatment but requires further investigation.                                         SUMMARY               Vascular cognitive impairment can be caused by several mechanisms.

RECENT FINDINGS                                Some microorganisms exhibit neurotropism for the spinal cord (eg, enteroviruses such as poliovirus and flaviviruses such as West Nile virus), while others are more protean in neurologic manifestations (eg, herpesviruses such as varicella-zoster virus), and others are only rarely reported to cause myelopathy (eg, certain fungal and parasitic infections). Individuals who are immunocompromised are at increased risk of disseminated infection to the central nervous system. Within the last few years, an enterovirus D68 outbreak has been associated with cases of acute flaccid paralysis in children, and emerging Zika virus infection has been concurrent with cases of acute flaccid paralysis due to Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, although cases of myelitis have also been reported. Associated pathogens differ by geographic distribution, with myelopathies related to                 Borrelia burgdorferi                 (Lyme disease) and West Nile virus more commonly seen in the United States and parasitic infections encountered more often in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.

This article reviews the clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, diagnostic workup, novel pathophysiologic insights, and treatment of immunocompetent patients with primary CNS lymphoma.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The prognosis of primary CNS lymphoma has significantly improved over the past few decades because of the introduction of and widespread use of high-dose methotrexate, which is now the backbone of all first-line combination chemotherapy treatments. Despite this progress, durable remission is still observed in only approximately 50\% of patients. Novel insights into the pathophysiology of primary CNS lymphoma have identified the B-cell receptor pathway as well as the suppressed tumor immune microenvironment and immune evasion as key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of primary CNS lymphoma. Novel, small molecules and agents targeting these aberrant pathways have been introduced into clinical trials of recurrent/refractory primary CNS lymphomas. Agents such as the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib or immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide have shown promising response rates in the relapsed setting.                                         SUMMARY               Diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma requires a high level of suspicion because clinical signs and deficits can vary and depend on the involved CNS compartments. Rapid initiation of therapy is essential for recovery and prognosis. The optimal treatment regimen has not been defined, but methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimens are considered the standard treatment approach for induction treatment.

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               The growing use of factor Xa inhibitors has increasingly caused patients with stroke to be excluded from treatment with IV thrombolysis. Important geographic, socioeconomic, sex, race, and ethnic disparities have been identified in the implementation of IV thrombolysis and need to be overcome. IV thrombolysis substantially improves outcomes when provided within the first golden hour after stroke onset in patients treated in mobile stroke units, supporting the ``time is brain'' concept and encouraging the possible value of more widespread implementation of the mobile stroke unit approach. At the same time, other studies have shown that IV thrombolysis can be successful in patients whose ``tissue clock'' is still ticking up to 9 hours after stroke onset or in patients who awaken with their stroke, as demonstrated by favorable imaging profiles. These considerations, along with the emergence of endovascular thrombectomy, have fostered examination of our care systems, including the ``drip and ship'' versus direct to comprehensive or endovascular thrombectomy stroke center approaches, as well as the possibility of skipping IV thrombolysis in certain patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy. Data suggesting that tenecteplase is at least noninferior to alteplase, as well as its more convenient dosing, has led to its increased use. Ongoing studies are evaluating newer thrombolytics and adding antithrombotic therapy to IV thrombolysis.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               IV thrombolysis remains the most common acute stroke treatment. Advances in acting faster to treat stroke have increased its efficacy, and advances in imaging have expanded its use. However, implementing these advances and overcoming disparities in IV thrombolysis use remain major challenges.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The suspicion that LEMS is rare but also likely underdiagnosed is supported by recent epidemiologic data. A validated, LEMS-specific scale now exists to assess and monitor disease, and symptomatic and immunomodulatory treatments are available. As presynaptic disorders of neuromuscular transmission, LEMS and botulism share electrodiagnostic abnormalities but have important distinguishing features. Knowledge of the clinical features of botulism is needed, particularly with continued cases of infant botulism, the opioid epidemic increasing the incidence of wound botulism, and medical use of botulinum toxin, which may cause iatrogenic botulism. Foodborne botulism remains rare. Prompt recognition of botulism and administration of antitoxin can improve outcomes. MG may be exacerbated or may present de novo in the context of immune activation from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies for cancer. Immune-related MG commonly overlaps with myositis and myocarditis. Corticosteroids typically result in improvement. However, immune-related MG can be more fulminant than its idiopathic counterpart and may cause permanent disability or death.                                         SUMMARY               The diagnosis of LEMS, botulism, or immune-related MG can generally be made from the patient's history, supplemented with directed questions, a physical examination designed to demonstrate abnormalities, and laboratory and electrodiagnostic testing. Early diagnosis and carefully selected treatment not only improve outcomes of the neuromuscular disease but can affect the prognosis of underlying malignancy, when present.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Death from stroke has decreased over the past decade, with stroke now the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. In addition, the incidence of new and recurrent stroke is declining, likely because of the increased use of specific prevention medications, such as statins and antihypertensives. Despite these positive trends in incidence and mortality, many strokes remain preventable. The major modifiable risk factors are hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and hyperlipidemia, as well as lifestyle factors, such as obesity, poor diet/nutrition, and physical inactivity. This article reviews the current recommendations for the management of each of these modifiable risk factors.                                         Recent Findings:               It has been documented that some blood pressure medications may increase variability of blood pressure and ultimately increase the risk for stroke. Stroke prevention typically includes antiplatelet therapy (unless an indication for anticoagulation exists), so the most recent evidence supporting use of these drugs is reviewed. In addition, emerging risk factors, such as obstructive sleep apnea, electronic cigarettes, and elevated lipoprotein (a), are discussed.                                         Summary:               Overall, secondary stroke prevention includes a multifactorial approach. This article incorporates evidence from guidelines and published studies and uses an illustrative case study throughout the article to provide examples of secondary prevention management of stroke risk factors.},

To simplify the approach to this category of patients, sensory-predominant polyneuropathies are divided broadly into either small fiber (or pain-predominant) neuropathies and large fiber (or ataxia-predominant) neuropathies, of which the sensory neuronopathies (dorsal root ganglionopathies) are highlighted.                                         Recent Findings:               Physicians can now easily perform skin biopsies in their offices, allowing access to the gold standard pathologic diagnostic tool for small fiber neuropathies. Additional diagnostic techniques, such as corneal confocal microscopy, are emerging. Recently, small fiber neuropathies have been associated with a broader spectrum of diseases, including fibromyalgia, sodium channel mutations, and voltage-gated potassium channel antibody autoimmune disease.                                         Summary:               Despite advances in diagnosing small fiber neuropathies and sensory neuronopathies, many of these neuropathies remain refractory to treatment. In select cases, early identification and treatment may result in better outcomes. ``Idiopathic'' should be a diagnosis of exclusion and a thorough investigation for treatable causes pursued.},

This article introduces readers to core concepts, as well as recent advances, in bedside and instrumented vestibular assessments. RECENT FINDINGS: Vestibular testing has improved immensely in the past 2 decades. While history and bedside testing is still the primary method of differential diagnosis in patients with dizziness, advances in technology such as the ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential test for superior canal dehiscence and the video head impulse test for vestibular neuritis have capabilities that go far beyond the bedside examination. Current vestibular testing now allows clinicians to test all five vestibular sensors in the inner ear. SUMMARY: Contemporary vestibular testing technology can now assess the entire vestibular periphery. Relatively subtle conditions, such as superior canal dehiscence or a subtle vestibular neuritis, can now be diagnosed with far greater certainty.},

Although neuroborreliosis was first identified almost a century ago, much confusion remains about how to accurately diagnose this quite treatable nervous system infection. Well-established diagnostic tools and therapeutic regimens exist for neurosyphilis, which has been well-known for centuries.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Serologic testing targeting the C6 antigen may simplify diagnostic testing in neuroborreliosis while improving accuracy. Historically, screening for syphilis has used a reaginic test followed by a treponeme-specific assay; alternative approaches, including use of well-defined recombinant antigens, may improve sensitivity without sacrificing specificity. In neuroborreliosis, measurement of the chemokine CXCL13 in CSF may provide a useful marker of disease activity in the central nervous system.                                         SUMMARY               Lyme disease causes meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculitis, and mononeuropathy multiplex. Cognitive symptoms, occurring either during (encephalopathy) or after infection (posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome) are rarely, if ever, due to central nervous system infection. Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome is not antibiotic responsive. Syphilis causes meningitis, cranial neuritis, chronic meningovascular syphilis, tabes dorsalis, and parenchymal neurosyphilis. The organism remains highly sensitive to penicillin, but residua of chronic infection may be irreversible.},

This article reviews various types of inherited myelopathies, with emphasis on hereditary spastic paraplegias and spastic ataxias.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The ever-growing number of myelopathy-causing genes and broadening of phenotype-genotype correlations makes the molecular diagnosis of inherited myelopathies a daunting task. This article emphasizes the main phenotypic clusters among inherited myelopathies that can facilitate the diagnostic process. This article focuses on newly identified genetic causes and the most important identifying clinical features that can aid the diagnosis, including the presence of a characteristic age of onset and additional neurologic signs such as leukodystrophy, thin corpus callosum, or amyotrophy.                                         SUMMARY               The exclusion of potentially treatable causes of myelopathy remains the most important diagnostic step. Syndromic diagnosis can be supported by molecular diagnosis, but the genetic diagnosis at present does not change the management. Moreover, a negative genetic test does not exclude the diagnosis of a hereditary myelopathy because comprehensive molecular testing is not yet available, and many disease-causing genes remain unknown.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Patients with MG can be classified based on antibody status and their clinical presentation; treatment responses may differ based on disease subtypes. Improved diagnostic methods and recognition of new antigenic targets such as lipoprotein-related protein 4 have led to improved diagnostic efficiencies. Corticosteroids remain the first-line immunotherapy, but there is a trend toward minimizing their use at high doses and for long durations. Oral immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and tacrolimus remain useful. An international, multicenter randomized trial comparing thymectomy plus prednisone with prednisone alone demonstrated that thymectomy improves clinical outcomes in selected patients with nonthymomatous MG. Eculizumab, efgartigimod, and ravulizumab have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adult patients with generalized MG who are acetylcholine receptor--antibody positive. These drugs take advantage of novel mechanisms of action and expand treatment options for patients with MG. Data on rituximab suggest that it can be a good option, especially for patients with MG who are positive for antibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). The number of clinical trials and drugs in development for MG is steadily increasing.

This article reviews these processes and the underlying neuroanatomy and provides an approach to the assessment of prefrontal lobe functions at the bedside.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive and behavioral frontal lobe functions are mediated by the prefrontal regions rather than the frontal lobes as a whole. At least five separate prefrontal functions have been defined: energization, task setting, monitoring, behavioral/emotional regulation, and metacognition. Energization is mediated by the superior medial prefrontal cortices bilaterally, task setting by the left lateral frontal cortex, monitoring by the right lateral prefrontal cortex, behavioral/emotional regulation by the orbitofrontal cortex, and metacognition by the frontal poles. Only task setting and monitoring are considered executive functions.                                         SUMMARY               Distinct cognitive and behavioral processes are mediated by different parts of the frontal lobe. Lesions in these areas result in characteristic clinical deficits that are discussed in this article. Key messages are that prefrontal regions mediate the higher cortical functions (as opposed to the frontal lobes in general) and that prefrontal functions are not equivalent to executive functions.},

Recent Findings:               Entrapment neuropathies are a common issue in general neurology practice. Early diagnosis and effective management of entrapment mononeuropathies are essential in preserving limb function and maintaining patient quality of life. Median neuropathy at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome), ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, radial neuropathy at the spiral groove, and fibular neuropathy at the fibular head are among the most frequently encountered entrapment mononeuropathies. Electrodiagnostic studies and peripheral nerve ultrasound are employed to help confirm the clinical diagnosis of nerve compression or entrapment and to provide precise localization for nerve injury. Peripheral nerve ultrasound demonstrates nerve enlargement at or near sites of compression.                                         Summary:               Entrapment neuropathies are commonly encountered in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and effective management require knowledge of peripheral neuroanatomy and recognition of key clinical symptoms and findings. Clinical diagnoses may be confirmed by diagnostic testing with electrodiagnostic studies and peripheral nerve ultrasound.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Next-generation (exome- and genome-based) sequencing technologies are revolutionizing the identification of single-gene causes of epileptic encephalopathy but have only had a modest impact on patient-specific treatment decisions. The treatment of most forms of epileptic encephalopathy remains a particularly challenging endeavor, with therapeutic decisions chiefly driven by the electroclinical syndrome classification. Most antiseizure drugs are ineffective in the treatment of these disorders, and treatments that are effective often entail significant risk and cost.

RECENT FINDINGS               The diagnosis and management of hyponatremia continue to evolve. Diagnostic accuracy is improved by assessing serum and urine osmolality as well as urinary sodium. Avoiding overcorrection of hyponatremia is crucial to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome, although even careful correction can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome in patients who have other risk factors. The clinical presentation of osmotic demyelination syndrome has expanded, with many patients presenting with extrapontine myelinolysis in addition to central pontine myelinolysis.                                         SUMMARY               Electrolyte disorders often present with neurologic manifestations. Whereas disorders of some electrolytes, such as sodium, preferentially affect the central nervous system, disorders of others, such as potassium and calcium, have significant neuromuscular manifestations. An understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders and recognition of these manifestations are crucial for the practicing neurologist as the symptoms are reversible with correct management.},

Recent work illuminating the complex genetic architecture of AD is discussed in the context of high and low risk and what is known in different populations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                A small proportion of AD is autosomal dominant familial AD caused by variants in                 PSEN1, PSEN2,                 or                 APP                 , although more recently described rare genetic changes can also increase risk substantially over the general population, with odds ratios estimated at 2 to 4.                 APOE                 remains the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, and understanding the biology of                 APOE                 has yielded mechanistic insights and leads for therapeutic interventions. Genome-wide studies enabled by rapidly developing technologic advances in sequencing have identified numerous risk factors that have a low impact on risk but are widely shared throughout the population and involve a repertoire of cell pathways, again shining light on potential paths to intervention. Population studies aimed at defining and stratifying genetic AD risk have been informative, although they are not yet widely applicable clinically because the studies were not performed in people with diverse ancestry and ethnicity and thus population-wide data are lacking.                                                        SUMMARY               The value of genetic information to practitioners in the clinic is distinct from information sought by researchers looking to identify novel therapeutic targets. It is possible to envision a future in which genetic stratification joins other biomarkers to facilitate therapeutic choices and inform prognosis. Genetics already has transformed our understanding of AD pathogenesis and will, no doubt, continue to reveal the complexity of brain biology in health and disease.},

Increased understanding of these pathologic entities is important for the neurologist who may encounter patients with an unusually slowly progressive degenerative dementia that may appear to meet criteria for Alzheimer disease but who progress to develop symptoms that are unusual for classic Alzheimer disease                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Hippocampal sclerosis has traditionally been associated with hypoxic/ischemic injury and poorly controlled epilepsy, but it is now recognized that hippocampal sclerosis may also be associated with a unique degenerative disease of aging or may be an associated pathologic finding in many cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Argyrophilic grain disease has been recognized as an enigma in the field of pathology for over 30 years, but recent discoveries suggest that it may overlap with other tau-related disorders within the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Primary age-related tauopathy has long been recognized as a distinct clinical entity that lies on the Alzheimer pathologic spectrum, with the presence of neurofibrillary tangles that lack the coexistent Alzheimer plaque development; thus, it is thought to represent a distinct pathologic entity.                                         SUMMARY               Despite advances in dementia diagnosis that suggest that we have identified and unlocked the mysteries of the major degenerative disease states responsible for cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly, diseases such as hippocampal sclerosis, argyrophilic grain disease, and primary age-related tauopathy demonstrate that we remain on the frontier of discovery and that our diagnostic repertoire of diseases responsible for such clinical symptoms remains in its infancy. Understanding such diagnostic confounds is important for the neurologist in assigning appropriate diagnoses and selecting appropriate therapeutic management strategies for patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although many different clinical manifestations of dystonia have been recognized for decades, it is only in the past 5 years that a broadly accepted approach has emerged for classifying them into specific subgroups. The new classification system aids clinical recognition and diagnosis by focusing on key clinical features that help distinguish the many subtypes. In the past few years, major advances have been made in the discovery of new genes as well as advances in our understanding of the biological processes involved. These advances have led to major changes in strategies for diagnosis of the inherited dystonias. An emerging trend is to move away from heavy reliance on the phenotype to target diagnostic testing toward a broader approach that involves large gene panels or whole exome sequencing.                                         SUMMARY               The dystonias are a large family of phenotypically and etiologically diverse disorders. The diagnosis of these disorders depends on clinical recognition of characteristic clinical features. Symptomatic treatments are useful for all forms of dystonia and include oral medications, botulinum toxins, and surgical procedures. Determination of etiology is becoming increasingly important because the number of disorders is growing and more specific and sometimes disease-modifying therapies now exist.},

This article describes the classification scheme, common subtypes, and the management of individuals with LGMD.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Advances in genetic testing and next-generation sequencing panels containing all of the LGMD genes have led to earlier genetic confirmation, but also to more individuals with variants of uncertain significance. The LGMDs include disorders with autosomal recessive inheritance, which are often due to loss-of-function mutations in muscle structural or repair proteins and typically have younger ages of onset and more rapidly progressive presentations, and those with autosomal dominant inheritance, which can have older ages of presentation and chronic progressive disease courses. All cause progressive disability and potential loss of ability to walk or maintain a job due to progressive muscle wasting. Certain mutations are associated with cardiac or respiratory involvement. No disease-altering therapies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for LGMDs and standard treatment uses a multidisciplinary clinic model, but recessive LGMDs are potentially amenable to systemic gene replacement therapies, which are already being tested in clinical trials for sarcoglycan and                 FKRP                 mutations.

The clinical manifestations of lesions to the lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal, and frontopolar cortex are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Traditional lesion studies have emphasized the role of a brain region in controlling a cognitive function. With advances in neurology, neuropsychology, and neuroimaging, the participation of the prefrontal cortex in large-scale networks has been established with recognition that cognitive dysfunction can arise not only from a lesion within a network but also from degenerative disease targeting these large-scale, dynamic neural networks. Although executive dysfunction can result from frontal lobe injury, this article highlights the role of distributed processes subserving executive functions. An atypical phenotype of Alzheimer disease has been described that selectively targets parietal-temporal-frontal networks important for core executive functions.                                         SUMMARY               Executive function comprises working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition and depends on top-down (ie, goal-driven) control of distributed processes occurring throughout the brain. The exact behavioral output (ie, function) depends on the content of the processes being controlled. Prefrontal cortex regions serve key cognitive functions related to social, emotional, and motivational aspects of behavior. The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in working memory, goal-driven attention, task switching, planning, problem-solving, and novelty-seeking. The ventral lateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in inhibition, response selection, and monitoring; the medial prefrontal cortex in self-knowledge, motivation, emotional regulation, and updating goal-directed behavior; the orbitofrontal cortex in personality, inhibition, and emotional and social reasoning. Although dysexecutive syndromes have been traditionally associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex injury, it is now recognized that they can also result from an impaired parietal-temporal-frontal system, which is targeted in a distinct form of atypical Alzheimer disease. This dysexecutive Alzheimer phenotype is characterized by impaired task performance on a wide battery of neuropsychological tests and simple daily tasks that require executive control. In contrast, dysexecutive syndromes more localized to the frontal lobe involve impaired executive control of social, emotional, and motivational aspects of behavior.},

This article reviews the definition of psychotic symptoms and the evaluation and management of psychosis in primary psychiatric and neurologic disorders frequently seen in neurologic practice.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Emerging evidence supports significant connections between psychosis and structural and functional brain changes in both primary psychotic and neurologic disorders. In addition to antidopaminergic activity, the mechanism of new-generation antipsychotics shifts to act on serotonin receptors, which potentially contributes to their benefits in the treatment of negative symptoms of psychosis and a lesser frequency of extrapyramidal side effects compared with typical antipsychotics. This is also helpful in the treatment of psychosis in patients who have neurodegenerative diseases and are vulnerable to developing extrapyramidal side effects from typical antipsychotics.                                         SUMMARY               Even with significant overlap, management of psychosis in primary psychotic disorders differs from the approach of psychosis in neurologic diseases.

RECENT FINDINGS                                Most cryptogenic strokes appear embolic, leading to the term                 embolic stroke of undetermined source                 . It was previously thought that embolic stroke of undetermined source was a single, therapeutically relevant entity, the underlying sources of which would respond to anticoagulant therapy; however, two large randomized trials found no benefit with anticoagulation compared to antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention after embolic stroke of undetermined source. A single antiplatelet drug remains the recommended long-term antithrombotic treatment for secondary stroke prevention in embolic stroke of undetermined source. However, three caveats should be considered with regard to cryptogenic stroke. First, those with minor stroke symptoms presenting early after onset should receive 3 weeks of dual antiplatelet therapy. Second, all patients with cryptogenic stroke should be monitored for atrial fibrillation. Third, patients 60 years of age or younger with a patent foramen ovale (PFO) should be carefully evaluated to determine whether the PFO may have caused the stroke and whether they might benefit from PFO closure.                                                        SUMMARY               More personalized strategies may soon be available to guide treatment of cryptogenic stroke. In the meantime, it is hoped that the application of recent findings from clinical trials will reduce stroke recurrence in this important population.},

Symptoms can include neck stiffness, yawning, thirst, and increased frequency of micturition. Clinical recognition of these symptoms is important to ensure early and effective attack management. Further understanding of the clinical phenotype and neurobiological mediation of these symptoms is important in the advancement of therapeutics research in both acute and preventive treatments of migraine.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Since 2014, functional imaging studies have been conducted during the premonitory stage of migraine and have provided novel insights into the early neurobiology and anatomy of the earliest stage of the migraine attack. These studies have shown early involvement of subcortical brain areas including the hypothalamus, substantia nigra, dorsal pons, and various limbic cortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex during the premonitory phase. More recent work has revealed altered hypothalamic-brainstem functional connectivity during migraine, which starts before the onset of pain. These exciting findings have provided functional correlation of the symptoms experienced by patients and changes seen on functional brain imaging.

RECENT FINDINGS               Growing evidence indicates that palliative care significantly improves quality of life and symptom burden for people with Parkinson disease and other serious movement disorders, while reducing caregiver burnout. An emphasis on advance care planning guides goal-directed treatment recommendations. Serious illness communication skills are evidence-based methods of relaying bad medical news to patients and mapping out values and goals in a way that provides comfort, emphasizes patient autonomy, and builds coping and resiliency strategies.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides a summary of the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with episodic positional dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS: Positional components are nearly ubiquitous among diagnoses of dizziness, so it can be challenging to classify patients with episodic positional dizziness simply based on the history of present illness. Overreliance on the presence of a report of positional components has likely resulted in misapplication or misinterpretation of positional testing and negative experiences with maneuvers to treat positional dizziness. The prototypical episodic positional dizziness disorder is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is caused by free-floating particles in a semicircular canal that move in response to gravity. The diagnosis is made by identifying the characteristic patterns of nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike test. Particle repositioning for BPPV is supported by randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and practice guidelines. Other disorders that can present with episodic positional dizziness are migraine dizziness, central lesions, and light cupula syndrome. SUMMARY: Episodic positional dizziness is a common presentation of dizziness. Neurologists should prioritize identifying and treating BPPV; doing so provides an important opportunity to deliver effective and efficient care. Providers should also recognize that positional components are common in most causes of dizziness and, therefore, should not over-rely on this part of the history of presentation when considering the diagnosis and management plan.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Recent advances in genetics have led to the identification of novel genetic causes for ataxia and a more comprehensive understanding of the biological pathways critical for normal cerebellar function. When these molecular pathways become dysfunctional, patients develop cerebellar ataxia. In addition, several ongoing clinical trials for Friedreich ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia will likely result in novel symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies for ataxia. Antisense oligonucleotides for spinocerebellar ataxias associated with CAG repeat expansions might be a promising therapeutic strategy.                                         SUMMARY               Cerebellar ataxias include heterogeneous disorders affecting cerebellar function, leading to ataxic symptoms. Step-by-step diagnostic workups with genetic investigations are likely to reveal the underlying causes of ataxia. Some disease-specific therapies for ataxia exist, such as vitamin E for ataxia with vitamin E deficiency and thiamine for Wernicke encephalopathy, highlighting the importance of recognizing these forms of ataxia. Finally, genetic diagnosis for patients with ataxia will accelerate clinical trials for disease-modifying therapy and will have prognostic value and implications for family planning for these patients.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article provides an overview of genetic metabolic disorders that can be identified by metabolic tests readily available to neurologists, such as tests for ammonia, plasma amino acids, and urine organic acids. The limitations of these tests are also discussed, as they only screen for a subset of the many inborn errors of metabolism that exist.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in next-generation sequencing and the emerging use of advanced metabolomic screening have made it possible to diagnose treatable inborn errors of metabolism that are not included in current newborn screening programs. Some of these inborn errors of metabolism are especially likely to present with nonspecific neurologic phenotypes, such as epilepsy, ataxia, or intellectual disability. However, cost may be a barrier to obtaining these newer tests. It is important to keep in mind that common metabolic testing may lead to treatable diagnoses. Resources are available to guide neurologists in diagnosing genetic metabolic conditions.                                         SUMMARY               This article introduces the clinical presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that are important for neurologists to consider in patients of all ages. Inborn errors of metabolism are rare, but they can present with neurologic symptoms. Newborns are now screened for many treatable metabolic disorders, but these screening tests may miss milder presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that present later in life. These patients may present to adult neurologists who may be less likely to consider metabolic genetic testing.},

Although these complications can be seen in patients without cancer as well, the purpose of this review is to highlight how the presentation, etiology, and management of delirium, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, and central nervous system infections may be different in patients with cancer.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Some of the newer anticancer therapies are associated with neurologic complications. Delirium and seizures have been described in patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and other immune effector cell therapies. Angiogenesis inhibitors can increase the risk of bleeding and clotting, including intracranial hemorrhage and stroke. The risk of opportunistic fungal infections, including aspergillosis, is elevated with the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib.

RECENT FINDINGS               Although death determination should be consistent among physicians and across hospitals, states, and countries to ensure that someone who is declared dead in one place would not be considered alive elsewhere, variability exists in the prerequisites, clinical evaluation, apnea testing, and use of ancillary testing to evaluate for BD/DNC. Confusion also exists about performance of an evaluation for BD/DNC in challenging clinical scenarios, such as for a patient who is on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or a patient who was treated with therapeutic hypothermia. This prompted the creation of the World Brain Death Project, which published an international consensus statement on BD/DNC that has been endorsed by five world federations and 27 medical societies from across the globe.                                         SUMMARY               The World Brain Death Project consensus statement is intended to provide guidance for professional societies and countries to revise or develop their own protocols on BD/DNC, taking into consideration local laws, culture, and resource availability; however, it does not replace local medical standards. To that end, pending publication of an updated guideline on determination of BD/DNC across the lifespan, the currently accepted medical standards for BD/DNC in the United States are the 2010 American Academy of Neurology standard for determination of BD/DNC in adults and the 2011 Society of Critical Care Medicine/American Academy of Pediatrics/Child Neurology Society standard for determination of BD/DNC in infants and children.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), thrombosis of the dural sinus, cerebral veins, or both, is a rare cerebrovascular disease. Although mortality rates after CVT have declined over time, this condition can result in devastating neurologic outcomes. This article reviews the latest literature regarding CVT epidemiology, details new factors associated with the development of CVT, and describes advances in CVT treatment. It also contains a discussion of future directions in the field, including novel diagnostic imaging modalities, and potential strategies to reduce the risks associated with CVT.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               The incidence of CVT may be as high as 2 per 100,000 adults per year. It remains a difficult condition to diagnose given its variable clinical manifestations and the necessity of neuroimaging for confirmation. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a novel CVT trigger, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), as well as an association between COVID-19 infection and CVT. Although VITT is a very rare event, timely diagnosis and treatment of CVT due to VITT likely improves patient outcomes. Direct oral anticoagulants are currently being used to treat CVT and emerging data suggest that these agents are as safe and effective as vitamin K antagonists. The role of endovascular therapy to treat CVT, despite a recent clinical trial, remains unproven.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               The incidence of CVT has increased, outcomes have improved, and the use of direct oral anticoagulants to treat CVT represents an important advance in the clinical care of these patients. Rates of CVT as a complication of COVID-19 vaccines using adenoviral vectors are very low ({$<$}5 per million vaccine doses administered), with the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination far outweighing the risks.},

It also provides a brief introduction to the concept of the glymphatic system and select cellular contributors to cerebral edema.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Cerebral edema and brain compression should be treated in a tiered approach after the patient demonstrates a symptomatic indication to start treatment. All patients with acute brain injury should be treated with standard measures to optimize intracranial compliance and minimize risk of ICP elevation. When ICP monitors are used, therapies should target maintaining ICP at 22 mm Hg or less. Evidence exists that serial clinical examination and neuroimaging may be a reasonable alternative to ICP monitoring; however, clinical trials in progress may demonstrate advantages to advanced monitoring techniques. Early decompressive craniectomy and hypothermia are not neuroprotective in traumatic brain injury and should be reserved for situations refractory to initial medical interventions. Medical therapies that acutely lower plasma osmolality may lead to neurologic deterioration from osmotic cerebral edema, and patients with acute brain injury and renal or liver failure are at elevated risk.                                         SUMMARY               A tiered approach to the management of cerebral edema and brain compression can reduce secondary brain injury when implemented according to core physiologic principles. However, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute brain injury is incomplete, and the conceptual framework underlying decades of clinical management may need to be revised in response to currently evolving discoveries regarding the pathophysiology of acute brain injury.},

Recent Findings:               The risk for recurrence and mortality appear to be low for neonatal and childhood stroke. Most children have relatively mild deficits, but those who have greater neurologic deficits, poststroke epilepsy, or strokes early in life are at risk for lower overall cognitive function. Stroke recurrence and long-term mortality after stroke in young adults are greater than originally thought. Cognitive impairments, depression, and anxiety are associated with higher levels of poststroke unemployment and represent targets for improved poststroke care. Poststroke care in young adults involves more than medical management. Self-reported memory and executive function impairments may be more severe than what is detected by objective measures. Assessment of possible cognitive impairments and appropriate management of psychological comorbidities are key to maximizing the long-term functional outcome of stroke survivors.                                         Summary:               Childhood and young adult stroke survivors survive for many more years than older patients with stroke. To ensure that these survivors maximize the productivity of their lives, neurologists must not only optimize medical management but also recognize that impairments in cognition and mood may be remediable barriers to long-term functional independence.},

MOG-associated disorders can easily be confused with other CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica, but they have a distinct clinical phenotype and prognosis.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Most patients with MOG-associated disorders exhibit optic neuritis, myelitis, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) alone, sequentially, or in combination; the disease may be either monophasic or relapsing. Recent case reports have continued to expand the clinical spectrum of disease, and increasingly larger cohort studies have helped clarify its pathophysiology and natural history.                                         SUMMARY               Anti--MOG-associated disorders comprise a substantial subset of patients previously thought to have other seronegative CNS diseases. Accurate diagnosis is important because the relapse patterns and prognosis for MOG-associated disorders are unique. Immunotherapy appears to successfully mitigate the disease, although not all agents are equally effective. The emerging large-scale data describing the clinical spectrum and natural history of MOG-associated disorders will be foundational for future therapeutic trials.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The imaging characterization of immune-mediated myelopathies and the discovery of neural autoantibodies have been crucial in improving our ability to accurately diagnose myelitis. The identification of autoantibodies directed against specific central nervous system targets has led to major improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying inflammation in myelitis. It has also allowed distinction of these myelopathy etiologies from noninflammatory etiologies of myelopathy and from multiple sclerosis and provided insight into their risk of recurrence, treatment response, and long-term clinical outcomes. Prompt recognition and appropriate testing in the setting of acute and subacute myelopathies is critical as timely administration of immunotherapy can help improve symptoms and prevent permanent neurologic disability. A patient should not be classified as having ``idiopathic transverse myelitis'' without a comprehensive evaluation for a more specific etiology. Achieving the correct diagnosis and learning to recognize noninflammatory myelitis mimics is crucial as they have therapeutic and prognostic implications.

It is important to recognize dysfunction of the cauda equina quickly to minimize diagnostic delay and lasting neurologic symptoms. This article describes cauda equina anatomy and the clinical features, differential diagnosis, and management of cauda equina disorders.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               The diagnosis of disorders of the cauda equina continues to be a challenge. If a compressive etiology is seen, urgent neurosurgical intervention is recommended. However, many people with clinical features of cauda equina dysfunction will have negative diagnostic studies. If the MRI is negative, it is important to understand the diagnostic evaluation and differential diagnosis so that less common etiologies are not missed.

Urgent evaluation and surgical intervention are recommended in most cases of compressive cauda equina syndrome. Other types of treatment may also be indicated depending on the etiology.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Rates of pyomyositis have increased recently in the United States, possibly because of an increase in risk factors such as IV drug use, obesity, and diabetes. Other peripheral nervous system infections, such as diphtheria, have become more common in older patients secondary to a lack of revaccination or waning immunity. Although recommended treatment regimens for most infections remain unchanged over recent years, debate over the ideal dosing and route of administration continues for some infections such as tetanus and leprosy (Hansen disease).                                         SUMMARY               Infections of the peripheral nervous system are varied in terms of the type of infection, localization, and potential treatment. Nerve conduction studies and EMG can help determine localization, which is key to determining an initial differential diagnosis. It is important to recognize infections quickly to minimize diagnostic delays that could lead to patient morbidity and mortality.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Tremor may be defined as an involuntary movement that is rhythmic (ie, regularly recurrent) and oscillatory (ie, rotating around a central plane) and may manifest in a variety of ways; accordingly, tremor has a rich clinical phenomenology. Consequently, the diagnosis of tremor disorders can be challenging, and misdiagnoses are common. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with straightforward approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of tremors.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Focused ultrasound thalamotomy of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is an emerging and promising therapy for the treatment of essential tremor.                                         SUMMARY               The evaluation should start with a detailed tremor history followed by a focused neurologic examination, which should attend to the many subtleties of tremor phenomenology. Among other things, the history and examination are used to establish whether the primary tremor is an action tremor (ie, postural, kinetic, or intention tremor) or a resting tremor. The clinician should then formulate two sets of diagnoses: disorders in which action tremor is the predominant tremor versus those in which resting tremor is the predominant tremor. Among the most common of the former type are essential tremor, enhanced physiologic tremor, drug-induced tremor, dystonic tremor, primary writing tremor, orthostatic tremor, and cerebellar tremor. Parkinson disease is the most common disorder of resting tremor. This article details the clinical features of each of these disorders, as well as those of additional tremor disorders.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Both meningiomas and pituitary adenomas are common brain tumors. In many cases, these lesions are found incidentally on imaging when patients are being evaluated for a variety of symptoms and signs. While nonmalignant, these tumors are occasionally associated with significant morbidity due to location and resulting secondary symptoms. Rarely, these tumors can also transform into malignant variants. Surgical techniques allow for more complete resections with minimal complications. Significant progress is being made in understanding the molecular biology of meningioma, which may result in wider availability of targeted therapies, especially for patients who are not candidates for other therapeutic modalities. Medical therapies for secretory pituitary adenomas continue to evolve. Craniopharyngiomas are nonmalignant tumors associated with significant morbidity due to their location. Molecular subtypes exist and may respond to targeted agents. Glioneuronal tumors are low-grade neoplasms potentially cured by gross total resection; however, residual and recurrent disease may require additional therapy. Recent studies have identified potentially targetable molecular alterations in more than half of cases.                                         SUMMARY               Meningiomas and pituitary adenomas are frequently encountered in neurologic practice, and familiarity with their presentation and management is essential for a practicing neurologist. Craniopharyngiomas, meningiomas, and glioneuronal tumors are characterized by a high frequency of potentially actionable genetic alterations, and targeted therapies may eventually supplement surgical therapy of these nonmalignant tumors.},

This article describes the neurologic complications that are commonly encountered in patients who are critically ill from medical diseases and presents strategies for their diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Chronic neurologic disability is common after critical medical illness and is a major factor in the quality of life for survivors of critical illness. Studies that carefully assessed groups of patients with general critical illness have identified a substantial rate of covert seizures, brain infarcts, muscle wasting, peripheral nerve injuries, and other neurologic sequelae that are strong predictors of poor neurologic outcomes. As the population ages and intensive care survivorship increases, critical illness--related neurologic impairments represent a large and growing proportion of the overall burden of neurologic disease.

Neurologic outcome prediction, or neuroprognostication, is a complex undertaking with many important ramifications. It allows patients with good prognoses to be supported aggressively, survive, and recover; conversely, it avoids inappropriate prolonged and costly care in those with devastating injuries.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Striving to maintain a high prediction performance during prognostic assessments encompasses acknowledging the shortcomings of this task and the challenges created by advances in medicine, which constantly shift the natural history of neurologic conditions. Embracing the unknowns of outcome prediction and the boundaries of knowledge surrounding neurologic recovery and plasticity is a necessary step toward refining neuroprognostication practices and improving the accuracy of prognostic impressions. The pillars of modern neuroprognostication include comprehensive characterization of neurologic injury burden (primary and secondary injuries), gauging cerebral resilience and estimated neurologic reserve, and tying it all together with individual values surrounding the acceptable extent of disability and the difficulties of an arduous convalescence journey.

The cardiorespiratory system is responsible for the delivery of oxygen and energy substrates to the brain. Therefore, diseases of the heart and lungs can lead to various neurologic illnesses. This article reviews various cardiac and pulmonary pathologies that can lead to neurologic injury and discusses the relevant pathophysiologic mechanisms.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               We have lived through unprecedented times over the past 3 years with the emergence and rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the effects of COVID-19 on the lungs and heart, an increased incidence of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and stroke associated with cardiorespiratory pathologies has been observed. Newer evidence has questioned the benefit of induced hypothermia in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Further, global collaborative initiatives such as the Curing Coma Campaign are underway with the goal of improving the care of patients with coma and disorders of consciousness, including those resulting from cardiac and pulmonary pathologies.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               The neurologic complications of cardiorespiratory disorders are common and present in various forms such as stroke or hypoxic and anoxic injury related to cardiac or respiratory failure. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, neurologic complications have increased in recent years.

Recent Findings:               Fabry disease causes early-onset stroke, particularly of the vertebrobasilar system; enzyme replacement therapy should be considered in affected patients. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, causes migraines, early-onset lacunar strokes, and dementia. Moyamoya disease can cause either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke; revascularization is recommended in some patients. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy causes both microhemorrhages and macrohemorrhages, resulting in typical stroke symptoms and progressive dementia. Pregnancy raises the risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, particularly in women with preeclampsia/eclampsia. Pregnant women are also at risk for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Experts recommend that pregnant women with acute ischemic stroke not be systematically denied the potential benefits of IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.

Guidance for effectively identifying obsessive-compulsive symptoms is provided, and treatment options, including psychotherapy, pharmacologic management, and neuromodulation approaches for treatment-resistant OCD, are discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                OCD affects 2\% to 3\% of adults worldwide and is associated with substantial individual disability and societal costs. Lack of recognition of common OCD symptom types, in addition to shame and fear of stigma on the part of patients, has created an average delay in diagnosis by almost 10 years and a delay in effective treatment (ie, a treatment gap) of nearly 2 years. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically a form of CBT that includes a type of behavioral intervention called                 exposure and response prevention                 , remains the most effective form of treatment for OCD. If CBT is not effective or not available, pharmacologic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or clomipramine, a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, can also be of benefit. Neuromodulation approaches such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation are rapidly emerging as effective treatments for OCD, particularly for patients who have not experienced an adequate response to psychotherapy or pharmacologic management.

Early intervention and appropriate treatment can substantially reduce OCD symptom severity, improve quality of life, and minimize the functional disability associated with this chronic and often debilitating illness.},

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Cerebrovascular complications can occur in patients with blood cell and platelet disorders. Treatment strategies to prevent stroke are available for patients with sickle cell disease, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia. A diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura should be considered in patients with neurologic symptoms, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, mild renal insufficiency, and fever. Plasma cell disorders can be associated with peripheral neuropathy, and classification of the monoclonal protein type and neuropathy aid in diagnosis. Patients with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and skin changes) syndrome can present with arterial and venous neurologic events.

RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in fluid (CSF and blood-based) and imaging biomarkers are allowing for a more precise and earlier diagnosis of AD (relative to non-AD dementias) across the disease spectrum and in patients with atypical clinical features. Specifically, tau- and amyloid-related AD pathologic changes can now be measured by CSF, plasma, and positron emission tomography (PET) with good precision. Additionally, a better understanding of risk factors for AD has highlighted the need for clinicians to address comorbidities to maximize prevention of cognitive decline in those at risk or to slow decline in patients who are symptomatic. Recent clinical trials of amyloid-lowering drugs have provided not only some optimism that amyloid reduction or prevention may be beneficial but also a recognition that addressing additional targets will be necessary for significant disease modification.                                         SUMMARY               Recent developments in fluid and imaging biomarkers have led to the improved understanding of AD as a chronic condition with a protracted presymptomatic phase followed by the clinical stage traditionally recognized by neurologists. As clinical trials of potential disease-modifying therapies continue, important developments in the understanding of the disease will improve clinical care now and lead to more effective therapies in the near future.},

While early-onset AD is often overshadowed by the more common late-onset AD, recognition of the differences between early- and late-onset AD is important for clinicians.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Early-onset AD comprises about 5\% to 6\% of cases of AD and includes a substantial percentage of phenotypic variants that differ from the usual amnestic presentation of typical AD. Characteristics of early-onset AD in comparison to late-onset AD include a larger genetic predisposition (familial mutations and summed polygenic risk), more aggressive course, more frequent delay in diagnosis, higher prevalence of traumatic brain injury, less memory impairment and greater involvement of other cognitive domains on presentation, and greater psychosocial difficulties. Neuroimaging features of early-onset AD in comparison to late-onset AD include greater frequency of hippocampal sparing and posterior neocortical atrophy, increased tau burden, and greater connectomic changes affecting frontoparietal networks rather than the default mode network.                                         SUMMARY               Early-onset AD differs substantially from late-onset AD, with different phenotypic presentations, greater genetic predisposition, and differences in neuropathologic burden and topography. Early-onset AD more often presents with nonamnestic phenotypic variants that spare the hippocampi and with greater tau burden in posterior neocortices. The early-onset AD phenotypic variants involve different neural networks than typical AD. The management of early-onset AD is similar to that of late-onset AD but with special emphasis on targeting specific cognitive areas and more age-appropriate psychosocial support and education.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in acute stroke treatment, including the use of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion and, more recently, of IV thrombolysis in an extended time window, have resulted in a paradigm shift in how imaging is used in patients with acute stroke. This paradigm shift, combined with the understanding that ``time is brain,'' means that imaging must be fast, reliable, and available around the clock for physicians to make appropriate clinical decisions. CT has therefore become the primary imaging modality of choice. Recognition of a large vessel occlusion using CT angiography has become essential in identifying patients for endovascular thrombectomy, and techniques such as imaging collaterals on CT angiography or measuring blood flow to predict tissue fate using CT perfusion have become useful tools in selecting patients for acute stroke therapy. Understanding the use of these imaging modalities and techniques in dealing with an emergency such as acute stroke has therefore become more important than ever for physicians treating patients with acute stroke.

This article provides an evidence-based approach to confirming the diagnosis of ischemic stroke, characterizing comorbidities that provide insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of stroke, and identifying targets for treatment to optimize the prevention of recurrent stroke.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Identifying the presence of patent foramen ovale, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and unstable plaque is now routinely included in an increasingly nuanced workup in patients with stroke, even as ongoing trials seek to clarify the best approaches for treating these and other comorbidities. Multicenter trials have demonstrated the therapeutic utility of patent foramen ovale closure in select patients younger than age 60 years. Insertable cardiac monitors detect atrial fibrillation lasting more than 30 seconds in about one in ten patients monitored for 12 months following a stroke. MRI of carotid plaque can detect unstable plaque at risk of being a source of cerebral embolism.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               To optimize the prevention of recurrent stroke, it is important to consider pathologies of intracranial and extracranial blood vessels and of cardiac structure and rhythm as well as other inherited or systemic causes of stroke.

Such pathology most often affects the anterior portion of the nerve and is visible on funduscopic examination. Ischemic optic neuropathy is associated with typical vascular risk factors and with one systemic disease in particular: giant cell arteritis (GCA). This article provides an overview of the three major classes of ischemic optic neuropathy, including information on risk factors, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Optical coherence tomography provides precise anatomic imaging in ischemic optic neuropathy, showing neural loss weeks before it is visible on examination. Refinements of optical coherence tomography reveal optic nerve microvasculature and may assist in understanding pathogenesis and verifying diagnosis. New diagnostic algorithms and cranial vascular imaging techniques help define the likelihood of GCA in patients with ischemic optic neuropathy. Finally, intraocular drug and biological agent delivery holds promise for nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, whereas newer immunologic agents may provide effective steroid-sparing treatment for GCA.                                         SUMMARY               It is essential to recognize ischemic optic neuropathy upon presentation, especially to determine the likelihood of GCA and the need for immediate steroid therapy. A broad differential diagnosis should be considered so as not to miss alternative treatable pathology, especially in cases with retrobulbar optic nerve involvement.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                FSHD has a wide range of severity, yet a distinct phenotype characterized by weakness of the facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles, followed by weakness of the trunk and leg muscles. It can be caused by two genetic mechanisms that share a common downstream pathway, namely, the epigenetic derepression and subsequent misexpression of the myotoxic                 DUX4                 transcription factor. Treatment is currently supportive and outlined in evidence-based guidelines. Advances in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of FSHD are paving the way for targeted therapy development. Approaches for targeted therapies to reduce                 DUX4                 expression that are currently being explored include small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, vector-based RNA interference, and gene therapy.

RECENT FINDINGS               Ongoing research, building on landmark work regarding parallel distributed processing (PDP), provides the basis for understanding cognitive functions as a manifestation of the activity of populations of millions or billions of neurons in various highly interconnected networks. Population encoding networks have the following intrinsic properties that provide an orderly explanation for normal and degraded language: (1) a capacity for settling into stable ``attractor'' states; (2) processing occurs in and knowledge (long-term memories) is stored in exactly the same network; (3) a capacity for incorporating statistical regularities of experience, frequency, and age of acquisition; (4) support of content-addressable memory; and (5) graceful degradation, such that lesions increase the probability of errors but do not fundamentally transform network operations. Knowledge in parallel distributed processing networks resides in the strength of connections between units (synapses in the brain). Aphasia, whether stemming from stroke or dementing disorders, can be understood in terms of the degradation of one or more domains of knowledge.

SUMMARY               TAC syndromes are rare but important to recognize because of their debilitating nature and greater likelihood for having potentially serious underlying causes. Although treatment options have remained somewhat limited, scientific inquiry is continually advancing our understanding of these syndromes and how best to manage them.},

RECENT FINDINGS               COVID-19 is the clinical syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It can affect the entire neuraxis, and presentations in the acute phase are variable, although anosmia is a common manifestation. Encephalopathy is common in patients who are hospitalized and is often associated with multiorgan involvement. Immune-mediated encephalitis is probably underrecognized; however, viral encephalitis is rare. Other manifestations include stroke, seizures, myelitis, and peripheral neuropathies, including Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, which sometimes has atypical manifestations. Treatment is symptomatic, and immunotherapies have been used successfully in some patients. Long-term complications include dysautonomia, exercise intolerance, malaise, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and mood disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 may occur in the acute setting and may be independent of respiratory manifestations. Immune-mediated syndromes and cerebrovascular complications are common. Large populations of patients are expected to have long-term neurologic complications of COVID-19, many of which may emerge only after recovery from the acute illness.},

While the bleeding risks are low, the morbidity or mortality associated with a hemorrhagic event is not insignificant. The objective of this article is to review the natural history of these vascular entities, the risk factors for hemorrhage, preventive treatment options, and the risks of treatment.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Randomized trials to inform preventive treatment strategies for unruptured intracranial aneurysms and brain AVMs are ongoing. Higher angiographic obliteration rates of unruptured intracranial aneurysms have been reported with the flow-diversion technique compared with alternative standard techniques.

ESSENTIAL POINTS               The decision to treat a patient with a brain aneurysm should consider patient factors, the patient's life expectancy, aneurysm anatomical factors, and treatment risks.

Its incidence is expected to rise because of the age-related incidence of atrial fibrillation and an aging population. This article summarizes the different causes of cardioembolism and outlines current management guidelines.                                         Recent Findings:               Since cardioembolic stroke is not a single disease entity, its diagnosis requires initial clinical suspicion and a comprehensive evaluation, including ECG, echocardiography, brain imaging, and cardiac monitoring. Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke, and anticoagulation is usually recommended. This article reviews risk stratification models to assist in the decision-making process and highlights the increased use of novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. New data support the importance of prolonged cardiac monitoring for diagnosing occult atrial fibrillation. Current data on other mechanisms of cardioembolic stroke, such as prosthetic heart valves and aortic arch atherosclerosis, are also presented, and the available evidence regarding patent foramen ovale closure in cryptogenic stroke is summarized.                                         Summary:               Cardioembolism is an important cause of ischemic stroke, with diverse underlying mechanisms requiring a tailored approach to diagnosis, management, and prevention.},

More effective approaches to enhance motor recovery following stroke are needed. This article reviews the rehabilitative principles and strategies that can be used to maximize post-stroke recovery.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Evidence dictates that mobilization should not begin prior to 24 hours following stroke, but detailed guidelines beyond this are lacking. Specific classes of potentially detrimental medications should be avoided in the early days poststroke. Patients with stroke who are unable to return home should be referred for evaluation to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Research suggests that a substantial increase in both the dose and intensity of upper and lower extremity exercise is beneficial. A clinical trial supports vagus nerve stimulation as an adjunct to occupational therapy for motor recovery in the upper extremity. The data remain somewhat mixed as to whether robotics, transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation are better than dose-matched traditional exercise. No current drug therapy has been proven to augment exercise poststroke to enhance motor recovery.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Neurologists will collaborate with rehabilitation professionals for several months following a patient's stroke. Many questions still remain about the ideal exercise regimen to maximize motor recovery in patients poststroke. The next several years will likely bring a host of new research studies exploring the latest strategies to enhance motor recovery using poststroke exercise.},

Diagnostic criteria for MS have evolved over time, and the latest version facilitates earlier diagnosis of MS in those presenting with typical clinical syndromes. This article summarizes the current diagnostic criteria for MS, typical and atypical presentations of MS, and when diagnostic criteria should be applied with caution.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The most recent version of the MS diagnostic criteria has the benefits of simplicity and greater sensitivity in comparison to previous iterations. However, misdiagnosis remains a significant issue in MS clinical care, even at MS specialty centers. It is, therefore, evident that careful clinical application of the current version of the diagnostic criteria is necessary and that tools improving the diagnostic accuracy of MS would be of substantial clinical utility. Emerging diagnostic biomarkers that may be useful in this regard, including the central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and fluid biomarkers, are discussed.                                         SUMMARY               Current MS diagnostic criteria facilitate the early diagnosis of MS in people presenting with typical clinical syndromes but should be used cautiously in those presenting with atypical syndromes and in special populations. Clinical judgment and existing paraclinical tools, including sequential MRIs of the neuraxis and laboratory tests, are useful in minimizing misdiagnosis and facilitating the accurate diagnosis of MS. Diagnostic biomarkers that may facilitate or refute a diagnosis of MS in these settings, and emerging imaging and fluid biomarkers may eventually become available for use in clinical settings.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Establishing whether the cause of orthostatic hypotension is a pathologic lesion in sympathetic neurons (ie, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension) or secondary to other medical causes (ie, non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension) can be achieved by measuring blood pressure and heart rate at the bedside. Whereas fludrocortisone has been extensively used as first-line treatment in the past, it is associated with adverse events including renal and cardiac failure and increased risk of all-cause hospitalization. Distinguishing whether neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is caused by central or peripheral dysfunction has therapeutic implications. Patients with peripheral sympathetic denervation respond better to norepinephrine agonists/precursors such as droxidopa, whereas patients with central autonomic dysfunction respond better to norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.                                         SUMMARY               Management of orthostatic hypotension is aimed at improving quality of life and reducing symptoms rather than at normalizing blood pressure. Nonpharmacologic measures are the key to success. Pharmacologic options include volume expansion with fludrocortisone and sympathetic enhancement with midodrine, droxidopa, and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Neurogenic supine hypertension complicates management of orthostatic hypotension and is primarily ameliorated by avoiding the supine position and sleeping with the head of the bed elevated.},

Gastrointestinal emergencies may arise, including intestinal pseudoobstruction, intussusception, volvulus, and stercoral ulcer (ulcer of the colon due to pressure and irritation resulting from severe, prolonged constipation). Bowel function tests in neurologic patients often show a combination of slow transit and anorectal dysfunction. Management for slow transit constipation includes bulking agents, softening agents, yogurt/probiotics, and prokinetic agents. Suppositories, botulinum toxin injections, and transanal irrigation are options for managing anorectal constipation.

This article presents an up-to-date summary of the clinical presentation, investigations, and treatment options for urogenital dysfunction in patients with neurologic disease.                                         Recent Findings:               The pattern of lower urinary tract dysfunction is influenced by the site of the neurologic lesion. The risk for developing upper urinary tract damage is considerably less in patients with slowly progressive nontraumatic neurologic disorders, as compared to those with spinal cord injury or spina bifida. Investigations such as urinalysis, ultrasonography, and urodynamics provide further information about the cause and nature of lower urinary tract dysfunction. Antimuscarinic agents are the first-line management of urinary incontinence; however, side effect profile and anticholinergic burden should be considered when prescribing medications. {$\beta$}               3               -Adrenergic receptor agonists are a promising alternative oral medication. Tibial and sacral neuromodulation have been shown to be effective for managing incontinence, as well as urinary retention due to Fowler syndrome. Intradetrusor injections of onabotulinumtoxinA have revolutionized the management of neurogenic detrusor overactivity.                                         Summary:               Neurologic patients reporting urogenital symptoms require a comprehensive evaluation for planning a patient-tailored approach to management. Neurologists are increasingly inquiring about lower urinary tract and sexual functions and becoming involved in the management of these disorders.},

Early in their clinical course, PSP and CBS may be difficult to distinguish from Parkinson disease and several other illnesses, but it is crucial to do so because of implications for management and prognosis.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Early accurate diagnosis of PSP and CBS remains a challenge because of heterogeneity in presenting symptoms and high frequency of coexisting pathologies (especially Alzheimer disease and vascular disease). It is increasingly recognized that patients with PSP, CBS, and other parkinsonian disorders require multidisciplinary care for optimal outcomes. With the recent proliferation of biomarker studies and therapeutic trials for tauopathies, there is growing hope that better treatments for PSP and CBS are on the horizon.                                         SUMMARY               Although PSP and CBS currently lack disease-modifying therapies, it is important to diagnose them as early as possible so that the patient can benefit from the many available symptomatic therapies, support groups, and a growing number of clinical trials.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Pediatric brain tumors are a heterogeneous group of tumors that differ from adult brain cancers despite similar nomenclature. With the added complexity of the developing brain, treatment regimens are tailored to protect neurocognitive outcomes without sacrificing long-term survival. The 2016 World Health Organization's classification incorporated molecular characteristics to aid in defining the diagnosis and prognosis of these tumors. These changes have enabled providers to stratify patients, thus intensifying therapies in those with high-risk diseases and modifying treatments to reduce morbidity for children and to provide better outcomes. Recent published findings from clinical trials have been especially helpful for gliomas, embryonal tumors, and ependymomas. By using this new information, molecular factors that correlate with survival have been identified in patients. In addition, genetic findings in tumor tissue have also led to revelations in predisposing germline mutations.                                         SUMMARY               New findings from clinical trials and molecular stratification will shape the next generation of therapies in hopes of improving overall outcome, identifying pathways in tumorigenesis, and aiding in genetic counseling for children and their families.},

This article provides a diagnostic approach based on clinical history and neurologic examination leading to a narrow set of diagnostic tests.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Numerous discoveries in recent years have facilitated clinician access to more advanced laboratory and genetic testing to pinpoint the exact diagnosis in patients with muscle or neuromuscular junction disorders. Large-scale genetic testing has become much less expensive, and free testing has become available for many of the rare conditions because of increased research and the availability of effective therapies for these rare disorders.                                         SUMMARY               The approach to muscle and neuromuscular junction disorders depends on the clinical pattern of muscle weakness. By classifying patients into one of 10 muscle patterns, diagnostic testing can be targeted and gene testing yield will be optimized. With the increased accessibility and reduced cost of genetic testing (eg, gene panels, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, and chromosomal microarray), this clinical approach to muscle weakness and targeted gene testing will ensure a cost-effective investigational plan. This clinical approach should also assist clinicians in making a timely and accurate diagnosis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Contrary to popular belief, many congenital CNS infections are preventable and treatable. Treatment options exist for congenital cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis, although the efficacy of these treatments and the populations that may benefit from treatment are variable. Zika virus has recently emerged as a pathogen affecting the fetal brain, and new data suggest that the pathogenesis of Zika virus involves direct infection of neuronal progenitor cells leading to destruction of CNS tissue. The incidence of congenital syphilis has been increasing in the United States over the past decade as a direct result of new syphilis cases among adults and poor access to adequate maternal health care.

RECENT FINDINGS               Systemic autoimmune diseases can be associated with a wide spectrum of neurologic comorbidities involving the central and peripheral nervous systems. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be associated with a number of manifestations predominantly affecting the central nervous system (CNS), whereas peripheral neuropathy is less common. Sj{\"o}gren syndrome can be associated with peripheral neuropathy in 10\% of cases and CNS disease in 2\% to 5\% of cases. The risk of stroke is increased in SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Systemic vasculitides present most commonly with mononeuritis multiplex but can also affect the CNS. Cognitive dysfunction is a common symptom among patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, most commonly seen in patients with SLE or Sj{\"o}gren syndrome.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologic manifestations of systemic autoimmune disease are important to recognize, as they may often be the presenting manifestation leading to diagnosis of the systemic disease or may be associated with increased morbidity, other complications, or mortality.

Understanding the presentation of headache in women in relation to hormonal changes both during the menstrual cycle and throughout the life span is essential for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although perimenstrual migraine attacks are generally without aura, the diagnosis of migraine with aura has been added to the headache classification for menstrual migraine to account for women with the diagnosis of migraine with aura who experience menstrual migraine attacks. Emerging knowledge regarding the differences between menstrual and nonmenstrual attacks, the variability of attack triggering within and between women, and the response of women with menstrually related migraine to new migraine drug classes is contributing to better understanding and more effective treatment of these particularly burdensome and refractory attacks. Given the burden of migraine, almost one-fourth of women with migraine avoid or delay pregnancy. Women who experience migraine during pregnancy are more likely to have a hypertensive disorder and stroke during pregnancy and/or delivery and the postpartum period. Treatment of headache in general and migraine in particular in pregnancy is challenging because of fetal and maternal risks; however, a 2021 systematic review suggests that triptans and low-dose aspirin may not be associated with fetal/child adverse effects and could be more strongly considered for headache treatment in pregnancy.                                         SUMMARY               Headache in general and migraine in particular are extraordinarily common in women of reproductive age and fluctuate with hormonal changes and phases of life. Improved knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and response to treatment of perimenstrual attacks is essential for more effective response to this most burdensome headache type.

RECENT FINDINGS                                The 2018 Neurosarcoidosis Consortium diagnostic criteria emphasize that biopsy is key for diagnosis and determines the level of diagnostic certainty. Thus,                 definite neurosarcoidosis                 requires nervous system biopsy and                 probable neurosarcoidosis                 requires biopsy from extraneural tissue. Without biopsy,                 possible neurosarcoidosis                 can be diagnosed if the clinical, imaging, and laboratory picture is compatible and other causes are ruled out. Recent large retrospective studies from the United States and France established that infliximab appears to be efficacious when other treatments are inadequate.                                                        SUMMARY                                Sarcoidosis is a multisystem noninfectious granulomatous disorder that is immune mediated, reflecting the response to an as-yet unidentified antigen or antigens. Neurosarcoidosis refers to neurologic involvement due to sarcoidosis that clinically manifests in 5\% of cases of sarcoidosis, with asymptomatic involvement in as many as another one in five patients with sarcoidosis. Sarcoid granulomas can occur in any anatomic substrate in the nervous system, causing protean manifestations that have earned neurosarcoidosis the sobriquet                 the great mimic                 . Nevertheless, central nervous system sarcoidosis occurs in well-defined presentations that can be classified as cranial neuropathies, meningeal disease, brain parenchymal (including pituitary-hypothalamic) disease, and spinal cord disease. In addition, the peripheral nervous system is affected in the form of peripheral neuropathy and myopathy. Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of treatment, especially in the acute stage, whereas steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine are used for prolonged therapy to minimize steroid toxicity. Anti--tumor necrosis factor agents may help in refractory cases.},

This article describes the most common respiratory viruses that have neurologic manifestations, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               In vitro and in vivo studies have better elucidated the neurotropism of various respiratory viruses. Understanding host cell receptors that mediate viral binding and entry not only demonstrates how viruses enter host cells but also provides possible mechanisms for therapeutic interventions. Elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 binding and fusion with host cells expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor may also provide greater insights into its systemic and neurologic sequelae.

RECENT FINDINGS               Significant advances are being made in the recognition and characterization of the syndromically diverse AD variants. These variants are identified by the predominant cognitive and clinical features: early-onset amnestic syndrome, aphasia, visuospatial impairments, dysexecutive and behavioral disturbance, or motor symptoms. Although understanding of regional susceptibility to disease remains in its infancy, visualizing amyloid and tau pathology in vivo and CSF examination of amyloid-{$\beta$} and tau proteins are particularly useful in atypical AD, which can be otherwise prone to misdiagnosis. Large-scale research efforts, such as LEADS (the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease Study), are currently ongoing and will continue to shed light on our understanding of these diverse presentations.                                         SUMMARY               Understanding the clinical, neuroimaging, and biomarker profiles of the heterogeneous group of atypical AD syndromes improves diagnostic accuracy in patients who are at increased risk of misdiagnosis. Earlier accurate identification facilitates access to important interventions, social services and disability assistance, and crucial patient and family education.},

This review summarizes potential neurologic complications in patients who have undergone treatment for neurologic and systemic malignancies.                                         Latest Developments               Radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy along with other targeted therapies continue to be the mainstay of cancer treatment. These advances in cancer care have led to improved outcomes and increased the need to understand the spectrum of neurologic complications that may arise from treatment. While radiation and older therapies including cytotoxic chemotherapies have side effect profiles that are widely known and well understood, this article serves as a review of the more commonly associated neurologic complications of both traditional and newer treatments being offered to this patient population.                                         Essential Points               Neurotoxicity is a common complication of cancer-directed treatment. In general, neurologic complications of radiation therapy are more common in central nervous system malignancies, and neurologic complications of chemotherapy are more common in non-neurologic malignancies. Attempts at prevention, early detection, and intervention remain paramount in the reduction of neurologic morbidity.},

For each disorder, a historical perspective is offered and relevant neuroscientific studies are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Careful analysis of the consequences of lesions that disrupt visual functions such as facial recognition and written language processing has improved understanding of the role of key regions in these networks. In addition, modern imaging techniques have built upon prior lesion studies to further elucidate the functions of these cortical areas. For example, functional MRI (fMRI) has identified and characterized the response properties of ventral regions that contribute to object recognition and dorsal regions that subserve motion perception and visuospatial attention. Newer network-based functional imaging studies have shed light on the mechanisms behind various causes of spontaneous visual hallucinations.

RECENT FINDINGS               The clinical presentations, associated neuroimaging findings, and CSF abnormalities of patients with central nervous system infections who are immunocompromised may differ from those of patients with central nervous system infections who are immunocompetent and may be confused with noninfectious processes. Triggering of brain autoimmunity with emergence of neurotropic antibodies has emerged as a recognized parainfectious complication. New unbiased metagenomic assays to identify obscure pathogens help clinicians navigate the increasing range of conditions affecting the growing population of patients with altered immunity.                                         SUMMARY               Despite evidence-based prophylactic regimens and organism-specific antimicrobials, central nervous system infections continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in an increasing range of patients who are immunocompromised by their conditions and therapies. Multiple new drugs put patients at risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which has numerous imaging and clinical manifestations; patients at risk include those with multiple sclerosis, for whom infection risk is becoming one of the most important factors in therapeutic decision making.

RECENT FINDINGS               The incidence of ischemic stroke in young adults has been increasing since the 1980s, which has occurred in parallel with increasing prevalence of vascular risk factors and substance abuse among the younger population. Young adults have a considerably wider range of risk factors than older patients, including age-specific factors such as pregnancy/puerperium and oral contraceptive use. Behavioral risk factors such as low physical activity, excess alcohol consumption, and smoking are factors as well. More than 150 identified causes of early-onset ischemic stroke exist, including rare monogenic disorders. Several recent advances have been made in diagnosis and management of stroke in young adults, including molecular characterization of monogenic vasculitis due to deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 and transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale for secondary prevention. Compared with the background population of the same age and sex, long-term mortality in patients remains fourfold higher with cardiovascular causes underlying most of the deaths. The cumulative rate of recurrent stroke extends up to 15\% at 10 years. Patients with atherosclerosis, high-risk sources of cardioembolism, and small vessel disease underlying their stroke seem to have the worst prognosis regarding survival and recurrent vascular events. Young stroke survivors also often have other adverse outcomes in the long term, including epilepsy, pain, cognitive problems, and depression.                                         SUMMARY               Systematic identification of risk factors and causes and the motivation of patients for long-term prevention and lifestyle changes are of utmost importance to improve the prognosis of early-onset ischemic stroke.},

This article describes the epidemiology, genetic and environmental risk factors, clinical diagnosis, biomarkers, and treatment of late-onset AD, defined by age of onset of 65 years or older.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with AD dementia, with the number of affected individuals growing rapidly because of an aging population. Vascular risk factors, sleep disorders, and traumatic brain injury are associated with an increased risk of AD, while increased cognitive and physical activity throughout the lifespan reduce the risk of disease. The primary genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the apolipoprotein E (                 APOE                 ) {$\varepsilon$}4 allele. AD typically presents with early and prominent episodic memory loss, although this clinical syndrome is neither sensitive nor specific for underlying AD neuropathology. Emerging CSF and imaging biomarkers can now detect the key neuropathologic features of the disease (amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration) in living people, allowing for characterization of patients based on biological measures. A comprehensive treatment plan for AD includes use of symptomatic medications, optimal treatment of comorbid conditions and neuropsychiatric symptoms, counseling about safety and future planning, and referrals to community resources.                                                        SUMMARY               AD is very common in older neurologic patients. Neurologists should set the standard for the diagnosis and care of patients with AD and should be familiar with emerging biomarkers that have transformed AD research and are primed to enter the clinical arena.},

This article reviews basic pathophysiologic concepts regarding autonomic hyperactivity, its various forms of clinical presentation, and practical management considerations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is most common after traumatic brain injury but can also occur after other forms of severe acute diffuse or multifocal brain injury. Formal criteria for the diagnosis and severity grading of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity have now been proposed. A growing body of literature is beginning to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this disorder, but treatment remains based on observational data. Our mechanistic understanding of other distinct forms of autonomic hyperactivity, such as autonomic dysreflexia after traumatic spinal cord injury and dysautonomia after Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, remains rudimentary, yet clinical experience shows that their appropriate management can minimize the risk of serious complications.

RECENT FINDINGS               Immobilization of the spine and spine clearance should be individualized depending on the ability to perform a reliable neurologic examination, the presence of neck pain, and the imaging findings. Early surgery (within 24 hours) to achieve definitive cord decompression and spine stabilization may be beneficial. Ensuring adequate oxygenation and perfusion and avoiding secondary systemic complications remain the goals of the critical care of these patients. No neuroprotective treatment has been shown to improve outcomes. In fact, the use of high-dose methylprednisolone is now generally discouraged because of its major systemic adverse effects. Survivors of severe cervical traumatic spinal cord injury typically sustain substantial long-term functional impairment. Advances in our understanding of neuroregenerative strategies, especially stem cell transplantation, can offer the future hope of functional improvement to the many patients currently living with the consequences of traumatic spinal cord injury. Yet, at present, these therapies remain strictly investigational.                                         SUMMARY               The treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury remains supportive, and prognosis is still poor for patients who are severely affected.

Recent Findings:               The results of several randomized controlled trials consistently and conclusively demonstrating that previously functional patients with disabling strokes from a proximal intracranial artery occlusion benefit from prompt recanalization with mechanical thrombectomy using a retrievable stent have changed the landscape of acute stroke therapy. Mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours of symptom onset should now be considered the preferred treatment for these patients along with IV thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within the first 4.5 hours for all patients who do not have contraindications for systemic thrombolysis. Patients who are ineligible for IV rtPA can also benefit from mechanical thrombectomy. Collateral status and time to reperfusion are the main determinants of outcome.

RECENT FINDINGS               In addition to the previously established indications for intravenous (IV) thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within 4.5 hours of stroke symptom onset and endovascular therapy with mechanical thrombectomy for patients with large artery occlusion who can be treated within 6 hours of symptom onset, recent randomized controlled trials have now established new indications for emergency reperfusion in patients with wake-up stroke or delayed presentation (up to 24 hours from last known well in the case of mechanical thrombectomy). Identification of patients who may benefit from acute reperfusion therapy within this extended time window requires screening with perfusion brain imaging or, in the case of IV thrombolysis for wake-up strokes, emergency brain MRI. Collateral status and time to reperfusion remain the primary determinants of outcome.

RECENT FINDINGS               Therapy for LEMS has seen significant advances in recent years due to the approval of amifampridine-based compounds. LEMS is likely still underdiagnosed, particularly when no underlying malignancy is identified. Clinicians must have a strong suspicion for LEMS in any patient presenting with proximal weakness and autonomic dysfunction. Botulism is another rare disorder of presynaptic neuromuscular transmission that is most commonly associated with improper storage or preservation of food products. Over the past 2 decades, wound botulism has been increasingly reported among users of black tar heroin. A high degree of clinical suspicion and electrodiagnostic studies can be beneficial in distinguishing botulism from other acute neurologic disorders, and early involvement of state and federal health authorities may assist in confirming the diagnosis and obtaining treatment. When botulism is suspected, electrodiagnostic studies can provide clinical evidence of disordered neuromuscular transmission in advance of serologic confirmation, and providers should not wait for confirmation of the diagnosis to initiate treatment.                                         SUMMARY               A targeted clinical history and a thorough neurologic examination with support from serologic and electrodiagnostic studies are key to early diagnosis of LEMS and botulism.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article discusses neuroimaging in dementia diagnosis, with a focus on new applications of MRI and positron emission tomography (PET).                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although the historical use of MRI in dementia diagnosis has been supportive to exclude structural etiologies, recent innovations allow for quantification of atrophy patterns that improve sensitivity for supporting the diagnosis of dementia causes. Neuronuclear approaches allow for localization of specific amyloid and tau neuropathology on PET and are available for clinical use, in addition to dopamine transporter scans in dementia with Lewy bodies and metabolic studies with fludeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET).                                         SUMMARY               Using computerized software programs for MRI analysis and cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluations of hippocampal, ventricular, and lobar volumes improves sensitivity in support of the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia. MRI protocol requirements for such quantification are three-dimensional T1-weighted volumetric imaging protocols, which may need to be specifically requested. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and 3.0T susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequences are useful for the detection of white matter hyperintensities as well as microhemorrhages in vascular dementia and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. PET studies for amyloid and/or tau pathology can add additional specificity to the diagnosis but currently remain largely inaccessible outside of research settings because of prohibitive cost constraints in most of the world. Dopamine transporter PET scans can help identify Lewy body dementia and are thus of potential clinical value.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Recent functional neuroimaging studies focusing on the nonpainful symptoms of migraine have identified key areas of the central nervous system implicated in the early phases of a migraine attack. Clinical studies of spontaneous and provoked migraine attacks, together with preclinical studies using translational animal models, have led to a better understanding of the disease and the development of disease-specific and targeted therapies.                                         SUMMARY               Our knowledge of the pathophysiology of migraine has advanced significantly in the past decades. Current evidence supports our understanding of migraine as a complex cyclical brain disorder that likely results from dysfunctional sensory processing and dysregulation of homeostatic mechanisms.

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Although the mechanisms of many of the neurologic complications discussed here remain unclear, our understanding of the impacts of diabetes and hypothyroidism on the nervous system and muscle, including complications of rapid correction of chronic hyperglycemia, has advanced in recent years. Recent large studies have not demonstrated a convincing association between subclinical or overt hypothyroidism and cognitive decline.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Neurologists must become familiar with the neurologic complications of endocrine disorders not only because they are common and treatable (and often reversible) but also because they may be iatrogenic, as is the case with adrenal insufficiency in the setting of long-term corticosteroid therapy.},

Recognition and management of Bell's palsy relies on knowledge of the anatomy and function of the various motor and nonmotor components of the facial nerve. Avoiding diagnostic pitfalls relies on recognizing red flags or features atypical for Bell's palsy, suggesting an alternative cause of peripheral facial palsy.                                         Recent Findings:               The first American Academy of Neurology (AAN) evidence-based review on the treatment of Bell's palsy in 2001 concluded that corticosteroids were probably effective and that the antiviral acyclovir was possibly effective in increasing the likelihood of a complete recovery from Bell's palsy. Subsequent studies led to a revision of these recommendations in the 2012 evidence-based review, concluding that corticosteroids, when used shortly after the onset of Bell's palsy, were ``highly likely'' to increase the probability of recovery of facial weakness and should be offered; the addition of an antiviral to steroids may increase the likelihood of recovery but, if so, only by a very modest effect.                                         Summary:               Bell's palsy is characterized by the spontaneous acute onset of unilateral peripheral facial paresis or palsy in isolation, meaning that no features from the history, neurologic examination, or head and neck examination suggest a specific or alternative cause. In this setting, no further testing is necessary. Even without treatment, the outcome of Bell's palsy is favorable, but treatment with corticosteroids significantly increases the likelihood of improvement.},

RECENT FINDINGS               With a lifetime prevalence estimated at 2.5\%, OCD is a common condition that can also present comorbidly with neurologic disease. The core symptoms of OCD are obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive repetitive thoughts, urges, images, or impulses that trigger anxiety and that the individual is not able to suppress. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts occurring in response to an obsession with the intention of reducing the distress caused by obsessions. Neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and pharmacologic studies suggest that the expression of OCD symptoms is associated with dysfunction in a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit. Evidence-based treatments for OCD comprise pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line drugs recommended for OCD, but significant differences exist in their use for OCD compared to their use for other mood and anxiety conditions, including the need for higher dosage, longer trials necessitated by a longer lag for therapeutic response, and typically lower response rates. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, based on the principles of exposure and response prevention, shows results superior to pharmacologic treatments with lower relapse rates on long-term follow-up and thus should be considered in the treatment plan of every patient with OCD.                                         SUMMARY               OCD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms are frequently encountered in the neurologic clinic setting and require a high index of suspicion to effectively screen for them and an illness-specific therapeutic approach.},

This article reviews the importance of proper diagnosis, natural history, and management of headache disorders in pregnant and postpartum women.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Red flags for secondary headache specifically among pregnant women include elevated blood pressure and lack of a previous headache history, as well as a prolonged duration of the headache attack in those with a prior history of migraine. Migraine improvement is typical for most pregnant women, but the prognosis for women who have migraine with aura or chronic migraine is less predictable. Migraine is now an established risk factor for the development of preeclampsia. Recent data suggest hazards for compounds containing butalbital and possibly a better safety profile for triptans than previously believed during pregnancy. Peripheral nerve blocks and noninvasive neurostimulation devices are procedural and emerging therapies that have promising safety profiles for pregnant women with headache disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Acute headache occurring in pregnancy and the postpartum period is a red flag requiring diagnostic vigilance. Migraine frequency in women typically improves during pregnancy, although this trend is less certain when aura is present and after delivery. Acute and preventive treatment plans during pregnancy and lactation are plausible but may require shifts in therapeutic hierarchy. Relatively safe oral, parenteral, and procedural therapies are available for pregnant women. Noninvasive neuromodulation devices are already available and will likely play a greater role in the coming years. Migraine is associated with medical and obstetrical complications during pregnancy, and women with frequent migraine attacks may need to be considered high risk.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Most cases of trigeminal neuralgia are related to vascular compression, a demyelinating plaque, or a compressive mass affecting the trigeminal nerve. However, recent studies have shown that up to 11\% of patients have a family history of trigeminal neuralgia, suggesting that some patients may have a genetic predisposition to demyelination or nerve hyperexcitability. In these patients, trigeminal neuralgia may occur at a younger age, on both sides of the face, or in combination with other neuralgias.

Multimodality monitoring to assess intracranial pressure, cerebral oxygenation, cerebral metabolism, cerebral blood flow, and autoregulation is at the forefront of such advances.                                         SUMMARY               Understanding the anatomic and physiologic principles of acute brain injury is necessary in managing moderate to severe TBI. Management is based on the prevention of secondary brain injury from resultant trauma. Care of patients with TBI should occur in a dedicated critical care unit with subspecialty expertise. With the advent of multimodality monitoring and targeted biomarkers in TBI, patient outcomes have a higher probability of improving in the future.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The most recent guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease were published in 2020 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American College of Rheumatology.                                         SUMMARY               The most common neurologic complications of Lyme disease are cranial neuritis (most often a unilateral or bilateral facial nerve palsy), meningitis, and radiculoneuritis/mononeuropathy multiplex. Testing for Lyme disease begins with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If the ELISA is positive or borderline, Western blots should be performed for both IgM and IgG antibodies. As a general rule, in infectious diseases, an IgM antibody response is followed by an IgG antibody response. A central nervous system infection has either a CSF pleocytosis or pathogen-specific intrathecal antibody production. Lyme meningitis, cranial neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy, or other peripheral nervous system manifestations are treated with oral doxycycline or IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin G. No additional antibiotic therapy is indicated for patients with posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome or patients with concern for chronic Lyme disease with no evidence of previous or current Lyme infection.},

The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from paraneoplastic syndromes that progress quite rapidly to unidentified genetic disorders that progress slowly over the course of decades. This article highlights the diagnostic process, including the differential diagnosis, as well as treatment approaches and symptomatic management. The pillars of treatment are physical, occupational, and speech therapy as well as counseling and discussions of disease prognosis, genetics, and reproductive choices. There are many ways to help patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and improve their quality of life.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent years have seen significant improvements in genetic testing, with reductions in cost of both Sanger sequencing and whole exome sequencing and increasing availability of the latter. These improvements increase clinicians' ability to identify the etiology of neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and suggest future treatments.

RECENT FINDINGS               Initial screening EEG has been validated as a tool to predict which patients are at risk of future seizures. However, accepted definitions of seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus encourage a treatment trial when the diagnosis on EEG is indeterminate because of periodic or rhythmic patterns or uncertain clinical correlation. Similarly, recent data have demonstrated the diagnostic utility of intracranial EEG in increasing the yield of seizure detection. EEG has additionally been validated as a diagnostic biomarker of covert consciousness, a predictive biomarker of cerebral ischemia and impending neurologic deterioration, and a prognostic biomarker of coma recovery and status epilepticus resolution. A recent randomized trial concluded that patients allocated to continuous EEG had no difference in mortality than those undergoing intermittent EEG but could not demonstrate whether this lack of difference was because of studying heterogeneous conditions, examining a monitoring tool rather than a therapeutic approach, or examining an outcome measure (mortality) perhaps more strongly associated with early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy than to a sustained response to pharmacotherapy.                                         SUMMARY               Seizures and status epilepticus are events of synchronous hypermetabolic activity that are either discrete and intermittent or, alternatively, continuous. Seizures and status epilepticus represent the far end of a continuum of ictal-interictal patterns that include lateralized rhythmic delta activity and periodic discharges, which not only predict future seizures but may be further classified as status epilepticus on the basis of intracranial EEG monitoring or a diagnostic trial of antiseizure medication therapy. In particularly challenging cases, neuroimaging or multimodality neuromonitoring may be a useful adjunct documenting metabolic crisis. Specialized uses of EEG as a prognostic biomarker have emerged in traumatic brain injury for predicting language function and covert consciousness, cardiac arrest for predicting coma recovery, and subarachnoid hemorrhage for predicting neurologic deterioration due to delayed cerebral ischemia.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cerebral small vessel disease is increasingly prevalent and highly heterogeneous in neuroimaging and clinical presentation. Small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, cortical microinfarcts, and white matter hyperintensity of presumed vascular origin represent the major neuroimaging markers of small vessel disease. Increasing small vessel disease burden is associated with risk of incident stroke and dementia, as well as other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Current research strategies are targeting elucidation of the mechanisms of small vessel disease pathogenesis and pursuing clinical trials of therapeutic agents to reduce the clinical manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease.

This article provides a practical approach to the management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms and unruptured brain AVMs and reviews the risk of rupture, risk factors for rupture, preventive treatment options with their associated risks, and the approach of treatment versus observation for both types of vascular malformations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               For unruptured intracranial aneurysms, scoring systems on the risk of rupture can help with choosing preventive treatment or observation with follow-up imaging. Although the literature provides detailed information on the complication risks of preventive treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, individualized predictions of these procedural complication risks are not yet available. With observation with imaging, growth of unruptured intracranial aneurysms can be monitored, and prediction scores for growth can help determine the optimal timing of monitoring. The past years have revealed more about the risk of complications of the different treatment modalities for brain AVMs. A randomized clinical trial and prospective follow-up data have shown that preventive interventional therapy in patients with brain AVMs is associated with a higher rate of neurologic morbidity and mortality compared with observation.                                         SUMMARY               The risk of hemorrhage from both unruptured intracranial aneurysms and brain AVMs varies depending on the number of risk factors associated with hemorrhage. For both types of vascular malformations, different preventive treatment options are available, and all carry risks of complications. For unruptured intracranial aneurysms, the consideration of preventive treatment versus observation is complex, and several factors should be included in the decision making. Overall, it is recommended that patients with unruptured asymptomatic brain AVMs should be observed.},

Superficial siderosis can be more accurately diagnosed with imaging studies, and treatment using iron chelation has recently been studied but has not yet been established as an effective treatment. Central autonomic network damage in the brain can cause central orthostatic hypotension in some neurodegenerative diseases, and medication has been approved for treatment. SUMMARY: CNS causes of vertigo are numerous and important for clinicians to recognize. Examination findings are still an extremely valuable way to diagnose central vertigo; therefore, learning how to differentiate central from peripheral vertigo based on examination is an important skill.

This article reviews the pathophysiology, etiology and risk factors, evaluation, management, and outcomes of spontaneous cervical artery dissection.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Cervical artery dissection is believed to be a multifactorial disease, with environmental factors serving as possible triggers in patients who have a genetic predisposition to dissection formation. Cervical artery dissection can cause local symptoms or ischemic events, such as ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Neuroimaging is used to confirm the diagnosis; classic findings include a long tapered arterial stenosis or occlusion, dissecting aneurysm, intimal flap, double lumen, or intramural hematoma. Patients with cervical artery dissection who present with an acute ischemic stroke should be evaluated for IV thrombolysis, endovascular therapy eligibility, or both. Antithrombotic therapy with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment is used to prevent stroke from cervical artery dissection. The risk of recurrent ischemia appears low and is mostly limited to the first two weeks after symptom onset.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Cervical artery dissection is a known cause of ischemic strokes. Current data show no difference between the benefits and risks of anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy in the acute phase of symptomatic extracranial cervical artery dissection, thereby supporting the recommendation that clinicians can prescribe either treatment. Further research is warranted to better understand the pathophysiology and long-term outcomes of cervical artery dissection.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Whereas neurologic complications from traditional chemotherapy are widely recognized, newer cancer therapies, in particular immunotherapies, have unique and distinct patterns of neurologic adverse effects. Anticancer drugs may cause central or peripheral nervous system complications. Neurologic complications of therapy are being seen with increasing frequency as patients with cancer are living longer and receiving multiple courses of anticancer regimens, with novel agents, combinations, and longer duration. Neurologists must know how to recognize treatment-related neurologic toxicity since discontinuation of the offending agent or dose adjustment may prevent further or permanent neurologic injury. It is also imperative to differentiate neurologic complications of therapy from cancer progression into the nervous system and from comorbid neurologic disorders that do not require treatment dose reduction or discontinuation.                                         SUMMARY               Neurotoxicity from cancer therapy is common, with effects seen on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy are new cancer treatments with distinct patterns of neurologic complications. Early recognition and appropriate management are essential to help prevent further neurologic injury and optimize oncologic management.},

The major neurosurgical subspecialty procedures (cerebrovascular neurosurgery, neuro-oncology, epilepsy neurosurgery, functional neurosurgery, CSF diversion, endovascular neurosurgery, and spinal surgery) are broadly included under craniotomy procedures, endovascular/vascular procedures, and spinal procedures. This article focuses on the range of complications inherent in these approaches with specific scenarios addressed as applicable.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The morbidity and mortality related to neurosurgical procedures remains high, necessitating ongoing research and quality improvement efforts in perioperative screening, intraoperative management, surgical approaches, and postoperative care of these patients. Emerging research continues to investigate safer and newer options for routine neurosurgical approaches, such as coiling over clipping for amenable aneurysms, endoscopic techniques for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, and minimally invasive spinal procedures; postoperative monitoring and care of patients after these procedures continues to be a key component in the continuum of care for improving outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Postoperative care of patients undergoing major neurosurgical procedures is an integral part of many neurocritical care practices. Neurosurgeons often enlist help from neurologists to assist with evaluation, interpretation, and management of complications in routine inpatient settings. Awareness of the common neurologic complications of various neurosurgical procedures can help guide appropriate clinical monitoring algorithms and quality improvement processes for timely evaluation and management of these patients.},

These rare diagnoses include cramp-fasciculation syndrome, Isaacs syndrome, and Morvan syndrome. Recent investigations have led to an understanding of the autoimmune underpinnings of these conditions and their specific associated antibodies. As the presentation of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes includes muscle stiffness, twitches, and spasms, which are also shared with certain central nervous system and myopathic conditions, the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes is reviewed.                                         Recent Findings:               Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes share clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of motor nerve instability; however, their clinical presentations are varied. Case reviews have helped us understand the spectrum of symptoms associated with the three peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes reviewed here: cramp-fasciculation syndrome, Isaacs syndrome, and Morvan syndrome. More recently, research has focused on understanding the voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies as well as neoplasms associated with these conditions.                                         Summary:               The diagnosis of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes requires a high index of suspicion, support from the physical examination, familiarity with the spectrum of symptoms associated with peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes, and recognition of diagnostic EMG features. Voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies are associated with these conditions. Optimum treatment and autoimmune pathogenesis remain areas of active research.},

However, neurologic complications of HIV remain common; can affect any part of the neuraxis; and are due to direct effects of the virus, immunosuppression because of untreated HIV infection, aberrant immune responses in the setting of ART initiation, and ART toxicities.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains one of the most common neurologic complications of HIV encountered today, but milder forms predominate in people on ART. No specific treatments for HAND exist, but small trials and epidemiologic evidence suggest paroxetine, intranasal insulin, and maraviroc may have utility in its treatment; further trials of these agents are ongoing. Widespread ART use has decreased the incidence of central nervous system opportunistic infections, but prognosis often remains poor in those who develop opportunistic infections. High-titer positive serum cryptococcal antigen is strongly predictive of cryptococcal meningitis and provides a tool to enhance diagnosis in areas with limited resources. HIV is an independent risk factor for stroke, and accelerated aging associated with HIV infection results in neurologic diseases of older age occurring at much younger ages in individuals infected with HIV. Ongoing HIV replication in the CSF despite peripheral virologic suppression may contribute to the development of HAND and may not improve despite adjusting the ART regimen to increase central nervous system penetrance.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologists are likely to encounter patients infected with HIV in clinical practice. This article reviews the presentation, diagnosis, and management of the most common neurologic conditions associated with HIV infection and ART.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Central nervous system (CNS) TB remains common and associated with significant mortality and neurologic sequelae worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection is strongly associated with both the development of and mortality due to CNS TB.                 Strongyloides                 co-infection is associated with reduced CNS inflammation and improved outcomes in the setting of tuberculous meningitis. Stroke remains a common complication of tuberculous meningitis, and emerging evidence suggests aspirin may be used in this context. Although a recent nucleic acid amplification test has demonstrated suboptimal sensitivity in the diagnosis of CNS TB, emerging diagnostic techniques include cell-free DNA, peripheral blood microRNA, metagenomic next-generation sequencing, and advanced imaging techniques, but these are not yet well validated. CNS TB is associated with high mortality even with current treatment regimens, although novel, promising strategies for treatment are under investigation, including a combination of IV isoniazid and ethambutol and high-dose rifampicin.                                                        SUMMARY               TB can affect the nervous system in various ways and is associated with high mortality. Diagnosis remains challenging in endemic settings, with empiric treatment often initiated without a definitive diagnosis. Furthermore, optimal treatment regimens remain uncertain because current treatment for all forms of CNS TB is extrapolated from trials of tuberculous meningitis whereas the role of steroids in people with HIV and tuberculous meningitis remains controversial.},

Further, tests that are under development and likely to be used in the future are identified.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Technical improvements in assay sensitivity and precision have led to the rapid development of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD) over the past several years. Studies have found that the ratio of amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) peptides (A{$\beta$}42/A{$\beta$}40) and concentrations of phosphorylated tau isoforms in plasma can identify individuals with AD brain pathology. Blood-based tests may enable much broader use of AD biomarkers in the evaluation of patients with cognitive impairment.                                         SUMMARY               Even after a detailed history, examination, routine laboratory testing, and brain imaging, the cause of dementia sometimes remains unclear. CSF and blood-based biomarkers can evaluate for a range of neurologic disorders that are associated with dementia, including AD.

This article also discusses the underlying proteinopathies of neurodegenerative diseases (eg, amyloid-{$\beta$}, paired helical filament tau, {$\alpha$}-synuclein, and TDP-43 pathology) and vascular pathologies, including tissue injury (eg, infarcts, hemorrhages) with or without vessel disease.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                New criteria for AD pathologic diagnosis highlight amyloid-{$\beta$} as the                 sine qua non                 of AD; they require molecular markers of amyloid and establish a minimum threshold of Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage 3. Pathologic diagnosis is separated from clinical disease (ie, pathologic diagnosis no longer requires dementia). TDP-43 pathology, a major pathology in a frontotemporal dementia subtype, was found as a central pathology in LATE, a newly named amnestic disorder. Multiple pathologies (often co-occurring with AD) contribute to dementia and add complexity to the clinical picture. Conversely, Lewy body, LATE, and vascular dementias often have accompanying AD pathology. Pathology and biomarker studies highlight subclinical pathologies in older people without cognitive impairment. This resilience to brain pathology is common and is known as                 cognitive reserve                 .                                                        SUMMARY               The pathologies of dementia in aging are most commonly amyloid, tangles, Lewy bodies, TDP-43, hippocampal sclerosis, and vascular pathologies. These pathologies often co-occur (mixed pathologies), which may make specific clinical diagnoses difficult. In addition, dementia-related pathologies are often subclinical, suggesting varying levels of resilience in older people.},

RECENT FINDINGS               PCA is usually an atypical form of Alzheimer disease with relatively young age at onset. New diagnostic criteria allow patients to be diagnosed on a syndromic basis as having a primary visual (pure) form or more complex (plus) form of PCA and, when possible, on a disease-specific basis using biomarkers or underlying pathology. Imaging techniques have demonstrated that some pathologic processes are concordant (atrophy, hypometabolism, tau deposition) with clinical symptoms and some are discordant (widespread amyloid deposition). International efforts are under way to establish the genetic underpinnings of this typically sporadic form of Alzheimer disease. In the absence of specific disease-modifying therapies, a number of practical suggestions can be offered to patients and their families to facilitate reading and activities of daily living, promote independence, and improve quality of life                                         SUMMARY               While rare, PCA is an important diagnostic entity for neurologists, ophthalmologists, and optometrists to recognize to allow for early accurate diagnosis and appropriate patient management.

RECENT FINDINGS               Lifestyle modifications and migraine trigger avoidance are recommended as preventive measures for all individuals with migraine. The decision to recommend additional migraine preventive therapy should consider the frequency of migraine attacks and headaches, extent of migraine-associated disability, frequency of using acute migraine treatments and the responsiveness to such treatments, and patient preferences. Additional therapies include prescription medications, nutraceuticals, neurostimulation, and behavioral therapy. Considering evidence for efficacy and the risk of potential side effects and adverse events, treatments with the most favorable profiles include (in alphabetical order): amitriptyline, beta-blockers (several), biofeedback, candesartan, coenzyme Q10, cognitive-behavioral therapy, magnesium citrate, onabotulinumtoxinA (for chronic migraine only), relaxation therapy, riboflavin, and topiramate. In addition, erenumab, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor monoclonal antibody, received  approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of migraine in May 2018.

Individual treatment recommendations are determined based upon evidence for efficacy, side effect and adverse event profiles, medication interactions, patient comorbidity, costs, and patient preferences. Patients must be counseled on reasonable expectations for their preventive therapy and the importance of adhering to the recommended treatment plan for a period of time that is sufficient to determine outcomes.},

This article provides an update on the clinical presentations, diagnostic evaluations, and management of metabolic and toxic myelopathies.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Myelopathy and myeloneuropathy due to vitamin B                 12                 deficiency is increasing in prevalence partly because of an aging population. Early recognition of the clinical symptoms and rapid initiation of treatment is essential. Copper deficiency is now also recognized as causing a similar clinical picture as vitamin B                 12                 deficiency. Conditions leading to copper deficiency include bariatric surgery and excessive zinc intake. Unusual conditions such as lathyrism and konzo are relevant to all neurologists because of emigration from less well-developed countries. Myelopathy can also occur from substance abuse (eg, heroin and nitrous oxide), and early diagnosis could lead to improved patient outcomes. The spinal cord may also be injured in decompression illness that occurs in sport divers and individuals who work in pressurized atmospheres.                                                        SUMMARY               Knowledge and recognition of the various metabolic and toxic causes of myelopathy is important for the practicing neurologist, as timely diagnosis and rapid initiation of therapy is essential to improve the chances for recovery.},

Key aspects of management and the future of diagnosis and care for the disorder are highlighted.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               BvFTD is a clinical syndrome, not a disease. Patients with the syndrome share core symptoms that reflect degeneration within the most consistently affected brain regions, but accompanying features vary and reflect the precise topography of regional degeneration. The clinician must distinguish a bvFTD syndrome from psychiatric illness and other neurodegenerative syndromes that feature a prominent behavioral component. Antemortem prediction of pathologic diagnosis remains imperfect but improves with careful attention to the clinical details. Management should emphasize prevention of caregiver distress, behavioral and environmental strategies, symptom-based psychopharmacology, and genetic counseling.                                         SUMMARY               BvFTD is an important and challenging dementia syndrome. Although disease-modifying treatments are lacking, clinicians can have a profound impact on a family coping with this disorder. Treatment trials are under way for some genetic forms of bvFTD. For sporadic disease, pathologic heterogeneity remains a major challenge, and ongoing research seeks to improve antemortem molecular diagnosis to facilitate therapeutic discovery.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               In recent years, we have observed the emergence and reemergence of a number of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Zika virus is the most recent addition to this group, first causing sporadic cases of uncomplicated febrile illness followed by sizeable outbreaks in the Pacific. However, the epidemiology and clinical features of Zika virus infection have changed rapidly and dramatically; it is now recognized as causing Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome (GBS) in children and adults and congenital abnormalities in infected fetuses. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of Zika virus--associated neurologic illness and briefly reviews features of West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Zika virus has emerged as a significant human pathogen in recent years. In 2015, it began to cause large outbreaks of febrile rash illness in South America and the Caribbean. During these large Zika virus outbreaks, a significant increase in the incidence of GBS was also observed in multiple countries/territories. Zika virus--associated GBS has several unique features, including a relatively short interval between febrile illness and GBS onset, an unusually high incidence among older people, and prominent cranial nerve abnormalities. Congenital Zika syndrome includes a myriad of abnormalities, including microcephaly, lissencephaly, hydrocephalus, arthrogryposis, and parenchymal calcifications. Currently, no treatment has been identified for Zika virus, although work on vaccines is under way.                                         SUMMARY               Arboviruses continue to surprise us with unexpected emergence in various locations, the nature of clinical illness, and outcomes. Zika virus presents a classic example of this type of emergence. Ongoing surveillance will be needed to evaluate the long-term pattern of Zika virus and related arboviruses.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common neurologic condition that contributes to considerable mortality and disability because of its impact on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke risk and dementia. While attributes of the disease have been recognized for over two centuries, gaps in knowledge remain related to its prevention and management. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge for CSVD.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS                                CSVD can be recognized by well-defined radiographic criteria, but the pathogenic mechanism behind the disease is unclear. Hypertension control remains the best-known strategy for stroke prevention in patients with CSVD, and recent guidelines provide a long-term blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mm Hg for patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, including those with stroke related to CSVD. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the second leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage and may be increasingly recognized because of newer, more sensitive imaging modalities.                 Transient focal neurologic episodes                 is a relatively new term used to describe ``amyloid spells.'' Guidance on distinguishing these events from seizures and transient ischemic attacks has been published.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               CSVD is prevalent and will likely be encountered by all neurologists in clinical practice. It is important for neurologists to be able to recognize CSVD, both radiographically and clinically, and to counsel patients on the prevention of disease progression. Blood pressure control is especially relevant, and strategies are needed to improve blood pressure control for primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with CSVD.},

This article summarizes some of the recent innovations in this field and discusses likely future developments.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               At present, there is robust activity to improve all facets of care for patients with large vessel occlusion stroke, including better prehospital routing, more efficient in-hospital screening, expanding indications for thrombectomy eligibility, innovating novel thrombectomy devices, and improving the effects of recanalization on clinical outcomes. In addition, the integration of endovascular stroke therapy (EVT)---an emergent and frequently off-hours procedure that requires a specialized team of nurses, technologists, and physicians---into acute stroke care has transformed referral patterns, hospital accreditation pathways, and physician practices. The eligibility for the procedure will potentially continue to grow to include patients screened without advanced imaging, larger core infarcts, and more distal occlusions.

RECENT FINDINGS               Six randomized controlled trials undoubtedly confirmed the benefits of using endovascular thrombectomy on the clinical outcome of patients with stroke with large vessel occlusion within 6 hours from symptom onset compared with those receiving only standard medical care. In a meta-analysis of individual patient data, the number needed to treat with endovascular thrombectomy to reduce disability by at least one level on the modified Rankin Scale for one patient was 2.6. Recently, the concept of ``tissue window'' versus time window has proved useful for selecting patients for mechanical thrombectomy up to 24 hours from symptom onset. The DAWN (DWI or CTP Assessment With Clinical Mismatch in the Triage of Wake-Up and Late Presenting Strokes Undergoing Neurointervention) trial included patients at a median of 12.5 hours from onset and showed the largest effect in functional outcome ever described in any acute stroke treatment trial (35.5\% increase in functional independence). In DEFUSE 3 (Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution 3), patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy at a median of 11 hours after onset had a 28\% increase in functional independence and an additional 20\% absolute reduction in death or severe disability.                                         SUMMARY               For patients with acute ischemic stroke and a large vessel occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation who can be treated within 6 hours of stroke symptom onset, mechanical thrombectomy with a second-generation stent retriever or a catheter aspiration device should be indicated regardless of whether the patient received treatment with intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in patients with limited signs of early ischemic changes on neuroimaging. Two clinical trials completely disrupted the time window concept in acute ischemic stroke, showing excellent clinical outcomes in patients treated up to 24 hours from symptom onset. Time of ischemia is, on average, a good biomarker for tissue viability; however, the window of opportunity for treatment varies across different individuals because of a range of compensatory mechanisms. Adjusting time to the adequacy of collateral flow leads to the concept of tissue window, a paradigm shift in stroke reperfusion therapy.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The exponential growth of genetic testing is due to its increased speed and decreasing cost, and it is now a routine part of the clinical care for a number of neurologic patients. In addition, phenotypic pleiotropy (mutations in the same gene causing very disparate phenotypes) and genetic heterogeneity (the same clinical phenotype resulting from mutations in different genes) are now known to exist in a number of conditions, adding an additional layer of complexity for genetic testing in these disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Although the growing complexity of technical knowledge in the ordering and interpretation of genetic tests makes it necessary for neurologists to consult medical geneticists, limitations in the availability of such professionals often means neurologists will be on the front line dealing with suspected or confirmed neurogenetic conditions. The growing availability of broad genetic testing through chromosomal microarray and next-generation sequencing and the expanded phenotypic spectrum of many conditions has implications for genetic counseling and medical management. This article discusses the various forms of genetic variability and how to test for each of them. It also provides an update on the most common forms of neurologic presentations of genetic disease and a review of testing strategies.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The past several years have seen a dramatic increase in the ability to test for many inherited and autoimmune neuromuscular disorders more reliably and accurately. Similarly, numerous targeted therapies have been recently approved to treat previously untreatable disorders.

SUMMARY               Muscle weakness is a common symptom resulting from dysfunction that can occur at any level of the neuraxis and is a cardinal feature of many neuromuscular disorders. An accurate and meticulous history and a thorough neurologic examination are paramount in localizing the lesion in order to generate a differential diagnosis and guide appropriate ancillary testing. The patient's age at symptom onset, any identified inciting factors, tempo of symptom progression, pattern of weakness, and associated symptoms and signs are all important diagnostic clues in the evaluation of a patient presenting with muscle weakness.},

It is hoped that a greater understanding of each of these components will provide clinicians with the necessary information to deliver thoughtful and optimal care to affected individuals.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent advances include the finding that Tourette syndrome is likely due to a combination of several different genes, both low-effect and larger-effect variants, plus environmental factors. Pathophysiologically, increasing evidence supports involvement of the cortical--basal ganglia--thalamocortical circuit; however, the primary location and neurotransmitter remain controversial. Behavioral therapy is first-line treatment, and pharmacotherapy is based on tic severity. Several newer therapeutic agents are under investigation (eg, valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, cannabinoids), and deep brain stimulation is a promising therapy.                                         SUMMARY               Tics, defined as sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations, are essential components of Tourette syndrome. Although some tics may be mild, others can cause significant psychosocial, physical, and functional difficulties that affect daily activities. In addition to tics, most affected individuals have coexisting neuropsychological difficulties (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, mood disorder, disruptive behaviors, schizotypal traits, suicidal behavior, personality disorder, antisocial activities, and sleep disorders) that can further impact social and academic activities or employment.},

RECENT FINDINGS               PRES and RCVS are descriptive terms, each bringing together conditions with similar clinical-imaging manifestations. Headache, visual symptoms, seizures, and confusion occur in both syndromes. RCVS is usually heralded by recurrent thunderclap headaches, whereas encephalopathy and seizures are typical in PRES. In PRES, brain imaging shows reversible vasogenic edema that is typically symmetric and located in subcortical regions (mostly posterior predominant). In RCVS, brain imaging is often normal; cerebral angiography shows segmental vasoconstriction-vasodilatation affecting the circle of Willis arteries and their branches. Aside from shared clinical features, significant imaging overlap exists. Both PRES and RCVS can be complicated by ischemic and hemorrhagic brain lesions; angiographic abnormalities frequently occur in PRES and vasogenic edematous lesions in RCVS. Common triggers (eg, eclampsia, vasoconstrictive and chemotherapeutic agents) have been identified. Abnormal cerebrovascular tone and endothelial dysfunction may explain both syndromes. Management of these syndromes includes the removal of identified triggers, symptomatic treatment of headache or seizures, and moderate blood pressure control. Both syndromes are self-limited, with clinical recovery occurring within days to weeks. Long-term deficits and mortality are uncommon.                                         SUMMARY               PRES and RCVS have been well characterized and acknowledged to have significant overlap. Advances in our understanding of pathophysiology and risk factors for poor outcome are expected to optimize the management of these not uncommon syndromes.},

This article provides clinicians with a distilled understanding of the diagnoses and their epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               Cough-induced headache requires neuroimaging to exclude posterior fossa pathology and recently has been reported as a common symptom in patients with CSF-venous fistula. Clinical overlap is observed between patients with primary exercise headache and primary headache associated with sexual activity. Patients with recurrent thunderclap headache associated with sexual activity should be presumed to have reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome until proven otherwise. De novo external-pressure headache is a common sequela among health care workers using personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. New daily persistent headache is an important mimicker of chronic migraine or chronic tension-type headache and is distinguished by a daily-from-onset progression of persistent headache; a treatment-refractory course is often observed, and early involvement of a multidisciplinary team, including a psychotherapist, is advised.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with primary headache disorders that are classified as ``other primary headache disorders'' have presentations with unique diagnostic and management considerations. The disorders are highly recognizable, and an appreciation of the diagnoses will aid clinicians in providing safe and effective care for patients presenting with headache.},

RECENT FINDINGS               A new approach to classifying dystonia has been created with the aim to increase the recognition and diagnosis of dystonia. Molecular biology and genetic studies have identified several genes and biological pathways involved in dystonia.                                         SUMMARY               Dystonia is a common movement disorder involving abnormal, often twisting, postures and is a challenging condition to diagnose. The pathophysiology of dystonia involves abnormalities in brain motor networks in the context of genetic factors. Dystonia has genetic, idiopathic, and acquired forms, with a wide phenotypic spectrum, and is a common feature in complex neurologic disorders. Dystonia can be isolated or combined with another movement disorder and may be focal, segmental, multifocal, or generalized in distribution, with some forms only occurring during the performance of specific tasks (task-specific dystonia). Dystonia is classified by clinical characteristics and presumed etiology. The management of dystonia involves accurate diagnosis, followed by treatment with botulinum toxin injections, oral medications, and surgical therapies (mainly deep brain stimulation), as well as pathogenesis-directed treatments, including the prospect of disease-modifying or gene therapies.},

The phenomenology of chorea is described in addition to other common hyperkinetic movements that may be mistaken for or coexist with chorea. Chorea can be acquired or hereditary. Key historical and clinical features that can aid in determining the etiology are reviewed, and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment strategies are discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Clinical investigations are under way to target transcription and translation of the mutant huntingtin protein as a potential disease-modifying strategy in Huntington disease (HD). Additional heritable factors have been revealed through genome-wide association studies. Symptom-focused treatments for HD are are being studied, including a third vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitor for chorea attenuation and drugs to target irritability and cognitive impairment. Increased availability of genetic testing has led to increased awareness of HD mimics (eg,                 C9orf72                 and IgLON5).                                                        SUMMARY               Chorea is a relatively common hyperkinetic disorder with a broad differential. The first step in the approach to a patient with chorea is accurately defining the phenomenology. Once it has been determined that the patient has chorea, the investigation into determining an etiology can begin. Factors such as age of onset, time course, family history, unique clinical features, and imaging and laboratory findings can guide the diagnosis. Treatments for most causes of chorea are purely symptomatic, although it is important to recognize causes that are reversible or have disease-modifying interventions.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The manufacture, distribution, and use of so-called designer drugs are increasing. These agents can induce dramatic neurologic manifestations and can evade identification on conventional drug-screening assays. Additionally, gabapentinoids, drug agents that are very familiar to neurologists, are being abused in the general population at increasing rates to achieve euphoric highs and potentiate the effects of opiates. Furthermore, even well-known illicit narcotics such as heroin are posing dangers above their baseline because of ``lacing'' with additives or substitutes such as fentanyl and related compounds. These clandestine agents increase the potency of what are thought to be typical dosages to lethal levels, thus leading to more unintentional overdose deaths.                                         SUMMARY               The potential for short- and long-term nervous system injury from drug abuse is well established. However, it is important for the practicing neurologist to possess awareness of the features and observed sequelae of the toxidromes of both traditional and nontraditional drugs of abuse. This is because the use of both is widespread in our society and conventional drug screening can miss detection of some powerful agents, thus forcing us to maintain a high index of suspicion based on recognition of the clinical features.},

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and similar derivatives have exploded in prevalence, becoming the leading cause of overdose fatalities. The higher potency of synthetic opioids compared with semisynthetic and nonsynthetic opiates poses an increased risk for unintentional overdose when found as an adulterant in other illicit drug supplies such as heroin. Conversely, misinformation about the risk of symptomatic exposure to fentanyl through casual contact with the skin and ambient air has led to misdirected fear and stigma that threatens to impede valid harm-reduction measures for fentanyl users at risk of actual overdose. Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, overdose rates and deaths continued to climb, especially among those who use opioids and methamphetamine.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               A variety of potential neurologic effects and injuries can occur with illicit drug use owing to the diverse properties and mechanisms of action of the various classes. Many high-risk agents are not detected on standard drug screens, including so-called designer drugs, and the practicing neurologist is best served by recognizing the clinical features of the traditional toxidrome and other potential idiosyncratic effects of various illicit agents.},

This article reviews common inherited nervous system tumor syndromes including neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex, and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. The epidemiology, genetics, approach to diagnosis, neurologic and nonneurologic manifestations, and management options are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Awareness of the more common and clinically relevant familial nervous system tumor syndromes is important. These conditions teach us about the underlying biology that drives tumor development in the central and peripheral nervous systems including peripheral nerve sheath tumors (eg, neurofibroma, schwannoma), meningioma, vestibular schwannoma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, and hemangioblastoma. Knowledge of the clinical manifestations ensures that the neurologist will be able to diagnose these conditions, recommend appropriate surveillance, refer to specialists, and support optimal management. Important discoveries in the role of the underlying genetics have contributed to the launch of several novel drug trials for these tumors, which are changing therapeutic options for patients.                                         SUMMARY               Familial nervous system tumor syndromes are uncommon conditions that require specialized surveillance and management strategies.

RECENT FINDINGS               The guidelines for acute and preventive treatment of migraine were updated in 2019. These guidelines summarize the available evidence and outline the questions that should be addressed in future research.

Although some drugs and hormones can affect metabolism in skeletal muscle, this review will focus on the genetic metabolic myopathies.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Impairments in glycogenolysis/glycolysis (glycogen storage disease), fatty acid transport/oxidation (fatty acid oxidation defects), and mitochondrial metabolism (mitochondrial myopathies) represent most metabolic myopathies; however, they often overlap clinically with structural genetic myopathies, referred to as pseudometabolic myopathies. Although metabolic myopathies can present in the neonatal period with hypotonia, hypoglycemia, and encephalopathy, most cases present clinically in children or young adults with exercise intolerance, rhabdomyolysis, and weakness. In general, the glycogen storage diseases manifest during brief bouts of high-intensity exercise; in contrast, fatty acid oxidation defects and mitochondrial myopathies usually manifest during longer-duration endurance-type activities, often with fasting or other metabolic stressors (eg, surgery, fever). The neurologic examination is often normal between events (except in the pseudometabolic myopathies) and evaluation requires one or more of the following tests: exercise stress testing, blood (eg, creatine kinase, acylcarnitine profile, lactate, amino acids), urine (eg, organic acids, myoglobin), muscle biopsy (eg, histology, ultrastructure, enzyme testing), and targeted (specific gene) or untargeted (myopathy panels) genetic tests.                                         SUMMARY               Definitive identification of a specific metabolic myopathy often leads to specific interventions, including lifestyle, exercise, and nutritional modifications; cofactor treatments; accurate genetic counseling; avoidance of specific triggers; and rapid treatment of rhabdomyolysis.},

Recent Findings:               As most cases of acute low back pain have a favorable prognosis, current guidelines on imaging studies recommend conservative treatment for 6 weeks prior to obtaining an MRI if no red flags are present. Of these red flags, a prior history of cancer is the strongest risk factor for a malignant etiology and requires urgent evaluation with MRI. Management of acute low back pain is mainly conservative with oral non-narcotic analgesics and mobilization as the initial recommendations. For patients with radiculopathy, epidural steroids may result in short-term pain relief, but long-term effects are still unclear.

SUMMARY               The most frequently encountered primary neuralgias are trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, and, rarely, glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Nervus intermedius neuralgia is even more rare. All neuralgias merit a careful workup for secondary causes. Drug treatment generally relies on antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants, and baclofen. OnabotulinumtoxinA can be useful in treating some cranial neuralgias. Surgical and invasive treatments include ablation, gamma knife treatment, and microvascular decompression.},

The diagnostic approach, clinical features of important acquired and genetic choreas, and therapeutic principles are also discussed. Practical clinical points and caveats are included.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                C9orf72 disease is the most common Huntington disease phenocopy, according to studies in the European population. Anti-IgLON5 disease can present with chorea. The role of immunotherapies in Sydenham chorea has increased, and further clinical studies may be useful. Benign hereditary chorea is a syndrome or phenotype due to mutations in several genes, including                 NKX2-1                 ,                 ADCY5, GNAO1,                 and                 PDE10A                 . New-generation presynaptic dopamine-depleting agents provide more options for symptomatic treatment of chorea with fewer adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation has been performed in several choreic disorders, but features other than chorea and the neurodegenerative nature should be taken into consideration. Studies on genetic interventions for Huntington disease are ongoing.                                                        SUMMARY               Clinical features remain crucial in guiding the differential diagnosis and appropriate investigations in chorea. Given the complexity of most choreic disorders, treating only the chorea is not sufficient. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is required.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Identification of the etiology of chronic meningitis remains challenging, with no cause identified in at least one-third of cases. Often, several serologic, CSF, and neuroimaging studies are indicated, although novel diagnostic platforms including metagenomic deep sequencing may hold promise for identifying organisms. Infectious etiologies are more common in those at risk for disseminated disease, specifically those who are immunocompromised because of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplantation, or immunosuppressant medications. An important step in identifying the etiology of chronic meningitis is assembling a multidisciplinary team of individuals, including those with specialized expertise in ophthalmology, dermatology, rheumatology, and infectious diseases, to provide guidance regarding diagnostic procedures.                                         SUMMARY               Chronic meningitis is defined as inflammation involving the meninges that lasts at least 4 weeks and is associated with a CSF pleocytosis. Chronic meningitis has numerous possible infectious and noninfectious etiologies, making it challenging to definitively diagnose patients. Therefore, a multifaceted approach that combines history, physical examination, neuroimaging, and laboratory analysis, including novel diagnostic platforms, is needed. This article focuses on key aspects of the evaluation of and approach to patients with chronic meningitis. Specific infectious etiologies and differential diagnoses of subacute and chronic meningitis, including noninfectious etiologies, are addressed.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Psychogenic movement disorders, also referred to as functional movement disorders, describe a group of disorders that includes tremor, dystonia, myoclonus, parkinsonism, speech and gait disturbances, and other movement disorders that are incongruent with patterns of pathophysiologic (organic) disease. The diagnosis is based on positive clinical features that include variability, inconsistency, suggestibility, distractibility, suppressibility, and other supporting information. While psychogenic movement disorders are often associated with psychological and physical stressors, the underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood.

Inadequate transition planning and execution can lead to gaps in care, unexpected emergency department visits, and an increase in health care costs and patient/caregiver anxiety. Many barriers that prevent adequate transition have been identified, including insufficient time or staff to provide transition services, inadequate reimbursement, resistance from patients and caregivers, and a dearth of accepting adult providers.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Transition is distinct from transfer of care. Transition is a planned multistage process, while transfer refers to a point in time where responsibility of care shifts from one provider to another. Key differences exist between the pediatric and adult models of care. A successful transition should empower the patient to understand and take responsibility in managing his or her condition; foster independent functioning to the extent that is possible; integrate educational, legal, and community resources in the care plan; and identify appropriate adult health care providers at the time of transfer. Different models have been proposed to streamline the transition process, with improvement in patients' knowledge of their condition, self-efficacy, and confidence.

Latest Developments               Although most have historically been classified as autoimmune disorders, rheumatologic diseases are increasingly conceptualized as distributed along a spectrum with various contributions of autoimmune (adaptive immune dysregulation) and autoinflammatory (innate immune dysregulation) mechanisms. Our evolving understanding of systemic immune-mediated disorders has been accompanied by an expansion in our differential diagnoses and therapeutic options.                                         Essential Points               Rheumatologic disease involves both autoimmune and autoinflammatory mechanisms. Neurologic symptoms can be the first manifestation of these disorders, and familiarity with the systemic manifestations of specific diseases is essential to establish the correct diagnosis. Conversely, knowledge of the neurologic syndromes that are most likely to be associated with specific systemic disorders can help narrow the differential and increase confidence when attributing a neuropsychiatric symptom to an underlying systemic disorder.},

RECENT FINDINGS               An increasing awareness exists about the genotype-phenotype overlap in skeletal muscle channelopathies, and thus genetic testing is needed to make a definitive diagnosis. Electrodiagnostic testing in channelopathies is highly specialized with significant overlap in various mutation subtypes. Randomized clinical trials have now been conducted in these disorders with expanded treatment options for patients with muscle channelopathies.                                         SUMMARY               Skeletal muscle channelopathies are rare heterogeneous conditions characterized by lifelong symptoms that require a comprehensive management plan that includes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. The significant variability in biophysical features of various mutations, coupled with the difficulties of performing clinical trials in rare diseases, makes it challenging to design and implement treatment trials for muscle channelopathies.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The results of several large brain bank case series among subjects with a history of contact sports or repetitive head trauma have indicated that a high frequency of CTE may exist in this population. However, the true prevalence of CTE among individuals with a history of head trauma remains unknown, given that individuals who experienced cognitive, behavioral, and mood symptoms during life are more likely to have their brains donated for autopsy at death and epidemiologic studies of the condition are lacking. Neuropathologic consensus criteria have been published. Research-based clinical criteria have been proposed and are beginning to be applied, but the definitive diagnosis of CTE in a living patient remains impossible without effective biomarkers for the condition, which is an active area of study.

RECENT FINDINGS               With a prevalence of 1\% to 3\% and substantial comorbidity, high lifetime costs, and emotional burden, intellectual developmental disorder is characterized by limitations in both intellectual functioning (IQ less than 70) and adaptive behavior starting before 18 years of age.

RECENT FINDINGS               The epidemiology of infectious encephalitis and brain abscess has changed in recent years. Vaccination has reduced the incidence of certain viruses associated with encephalitis, while a decrease in fulminant otogenic infections has led to fewer brain abscesses associated with otitis media. However, changes in climate and human population density and distribution have enabled the emergence of newer pathogens and expanded the geographic range of others, and greater adoption of intensive immunosuppressive regimens for autoimmune conditions has increased the risk of opportunistic infections of the brain. The widespread use of early neuroimaging, along with improved diagnostic methodologies for pathogen detection, newer antimicrobial therapies with better brain penetration, and less invasive neurosurgical techniques, has resulted in better outcomes for patients with infectious encephalitis and brain abscess. Novel technologies including metagenomic next-generation sequencing are increasingly being applied to these conditions in an effort to improve diagnosis. Nevertheless, both infectious encephalitis and brain abscess continue to be associated with substantial mortality.                                         SUMMARY               Infectious encephalitis and brain abscess can present as neurologic emergencies and require rapid assessment, thorough and appropriate diagnostic testing, and early initiation of empiric therapies directed against infectious agents. Close clinical follow-up, proper interpretation of diagnostic results, and appropriate tailoring of therapeutic agents are essential to optimizing outcomes. Diagnosis and management of parenchymal brain infections are complex and often best achieved with a multidisciplinary care team involving neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, infectious disease physicians, and pathologists.},

This article provides an overview of autonomic disorders with potential autoimmune etiology.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent evidence highlights a close association between the autonomic nervous system and inflammation. The autonomic nervous system regulates immune function, and autonomic manifestations may occur in a number of systemic autoimmune diseases. In a few instances, autoimmunity directly influences autonomic function. Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is the prototypic antibody-mediated autonomic disorder. Over time, a better understanding of the clinical spectrum of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, the significance of ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies, other immune-mediated autonomic neuropathies, and autonomic manifestations of other systemic or neurologic autoimmune disorders has emerged.

RECENT FINDINGS               Adverse drug reactions are a source of significant morbidity and rising health care costs. Failure to recognize neurologic adverse drug reactions may prompt unnecessary testing to identify a primary neurologic condition and expose the patient to continued adverse effects of a medication.

SUMMARY               Early recognition of neurologic adverse medication reactions can be challenging but is essential to prompt discontinuation of the offending medication or administration of specific symptomatic treatments in select cases.

This article reviews the history and physical examination features pertinent for diagnosis, differential diagnoses, and treatments and approaches for optimal control of symptoms.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Essential tremor is a syndrome with symptoms extending beyond tremor to involve disturbances in gait, speech, cognition, and mood. Although the new guidelines on the definition and biaxial classification scheme have provided clarity, some tremor experts have critiqued the recently coined term                 essential tremor plus                 . For treatment, new orthotic devices and peripheral stimulation devices are now available in addition to pharmacologic and surgical options.                                                        SUMMARY               Essential tremor has a rich clinical phenomenology with many subtleties and nuances. A detailed history with open-ended questions and focused questions encompassing medical history, social history, and family history is key for establishing the diagnosis. The presence of bilateral action tremor for 3 years and absence of isolated head and voice tremor and absence of task- and position-dependent tremor are necessary for diagnosis. Dystonic tremor, Parkinson disease tremor, physiologic tremor, and drug-induced tremor are common differential diagnoses. Differentiating these tremor disorders from essential tremor based on phenomenology and physical examination alone could be challenging; thus, clinicians should seek additional clues from a detailed history. Treatment could begin with noninvasive and nonpharmacologic therapies, especially in mild cases. As the severity increases, they can advance stepwise to include pharmacotherapies and surgical interventions. With the growing recognition that essential tremor is not a monosymptomatic disorder, management should involve a multidisciplinary team. Furthermore, treatment selection should be based on shared decision making between patients and providers that gives due consideration to severity of symptoms, level of functional disability, impact on social interactions, patient preferences, and patient expectations.},

This article reviews the phenotype and pathophysiology of the disease as well as the recent efforts in clinical outcome measures and clinical trials.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                As the name implies, FSHD involves weakness of facial muscles, muscles that fix the scapula, and muscles overlying the humerus (biceps and triceps). The distinctive phenotype of FSHD occurs secondary to two different genetic mechanisms. FSHD type 1 (FSHD1) is due to a deletion on chromosome 4q, leading to hypomethylation and derepression of                 DUX4                 . FSHD type 2 (FSHD2) is due to mutations in                 SMCHD1                 with resulting hypomethylation of the same subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q and derepression of                 DUX4                 . Understanding the central role of                 DUX4                 has opened up the possibility of disease-modifying treatments. In preparation for clinical trials of novel agents, researchers are in the process of validating a number of clinical trial outcome measures including MRI, the 6-minute walk test, the FSHD Composite Outcome Measure, reachable workspace, electrical impedance myography, and the FSHD Health Index.                                                        SUMMARY               The treatment of FSHD is currently supportive only. While past clinical trials in FSHD have been largely disappointing, novel agents in development, including antisense oligonucleotides, gene therapy, and small molecules, hold promise for future meaningful therapies.},

This article discusses an approach to the recognition and management of seizures, stroke, and cardiac arrest as complications of other critical illnesses in the pediatric intensive care unit.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures occur frequently in children after cardiac arrest or traumatic brain injury and during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Seizures may add to neurologic morbidity, and continuous EEG monitoring is needed for up to 24 hours for detection.

SUMMARY               This article will aid the clinician in recognizing the clinical features of leukodystrophies and providing accurate diagnosis and management.},

This article reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The hallmark symptom of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is acute orthostatic headache; however, clinical presentations can be heterogeneous. New evidence shows that lumbar puncture is not always necessary or sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Some patients may have normal opening pressure, which suggests that insufficiency of CSF volume (hypovolemia) rather than CSF pressure might be the underlying mechanism. Several neuroimaging modalities can aid in diagnosis and localization of the CSF leakage, including brain MRI, spinal MRI, CT myelography, digital subtraction myelography, and radionuclide cisternography. Complications, such as subdural hematoma, can lead to a change in the headache pattern and potentially life-threatening consequences. Conservative treatments, such as fluid supplementation, can provide temporary relief; however, epidural blood patches, especially targeted ones, are more effective and definitive. For patients with refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension, surgical repair of spinal CSF leakages should be considered.                                         SUMMARY               Brain and spinal MRIs are important for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Early treatment with epidural blood patches may be considered to shorten the disease duration and minimize the potential risk of complications.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The prevalence of MS has increased in recent decades, and costs of care for patients with MS have risen dramatically. Black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals may be at risk for more severe MS-related disability. Multiple genetic MS risk factors have been identified. Factors such as low vitamin D levels and a history of Epstein-Barr virus, smoking, and obesity, especially during childhood, also influence MS risk. Traditionally thought to be a T-cell--mediated disease, recent research has highlighted the additional roles of B cells and microglia in both relapsing and progressive MS.                                         SUMMARY               Complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors affect the risk for MS as well as the disease course. People of color have historically been underrepresented in both MS clinical trials and literature, but current research is attempting to better clarify unique considerations in these groups. MS pathology consists of the focal inflammatory lesions that have been well characterized in relapsing MS, as well as a more widespread neurodegenerative component that is posited to drive progressive disease. Recent advances in characterization of both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative aspects of MS pathophysiology have yielded potential targets for future therapeutic options.},

This article examines the evidence for using the available options.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Carotid endarterectomy is an effective treatment option for reducing the risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients. Patients should be stratified for future stroke risk based on both the degree of stenosis and the presence of symptoms referable to the culprit lesion. Carotid stenting is also useful in reducing stroke risk, again in carefully selected patients. Because of the publication of significant data regarding both carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting in the last several years, selection can be far more personalized and refined for individual patients based on demographics, sex, patient preference, and medical comorbidities. Routine extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery remains unproven as a therapeutic option for large vessel occlusion in reducing the incidence of ischemic stroke although some carefully screened patient populations remaining at high risk may benefit; procedural risks and pathology related to alterations in blood flow dynamics are challenges to overcome. Indirect revascularization remains an appropriate solution for carefully selected patients with cerebral large vessel steno-occlusive disease, and multiple variations of surgical technique are patient specific. Indirect revascularization may benefit from clinical trials with larger patient populations for validation in specific pathologies and offers the advantages of lower surgical complication rates and reduced risk of pathologic responses to altered cerebral flow dynamics.

As neurologic dysfunction is one of the most frequent complications of these diseases and may even be the presenting symptom, it is important to be familiar with these complications to foster early recognition and intervention.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances have been made in the identification of which patients can safely undergo valvular surgery for treatment of infective endocarditis in the setting of stroke, which, ideally, will minimize the risk of recurrent stroke in these patients.

RECENT FINDINGS               Sporadic IBM is the most common acquired muscle disease in patients older than 50 years of age and is becoming more prevalent because of the increasing age of the population, the emerging development of more inclusive diagnostic criteria, and the advent of a diagnostic autoantibody. No effective therapy is known, and the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. Some pathogenic insight can be gleaned from other myopathies with pathologic similarities or hereditary inclusion body myopathies. Although clinically distinct from sporadic IBM, preclinical models of hereditary inclusion body myopathy have offered an opportunity to move some therapies toward clinical development.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with sporadic IBM experience significant morbidity, and the disease is associated with a large unmet medical need. As therapies are developed, improved diagnosis will be essential. Early diagnosis relies on awareness, clinical history, physical examination, laboratory features, and appropriate muscle biopsy processing. Future research is needed to understand the natural history, identify genetic risk factors, and validate biomarkers to track disease progression. These steps are essential as we move toward therapeutic interventions.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms have been increasingly recognized in PD and DLB, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment strategies. While PD is most associated with and diagnosed by the presence of motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms can often be the most debilitating for patients. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are highly prevalent nonmotor features and include cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, psychosis, impulse control disorders, and apathy. Neuropsychiatric symptoms can be difficult to recognize and diagnose in patients with PD, in part because of comorbidity and symptom overlap with core PD features. Treatment strategies are a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions used in the general population and those specific to PD. DLB is a clinical dementia syndrome, often with similar cognitive, behavioral, autonomic, and motor features as PD. Moreover, DLB has shared underlying pathophysiology with PD, as both are associated with postmortem findings of {$\alpha$}-synuclein neuropathology at autopsy and have shared genetic risk and prodromal symptoms. DLB is clinically differentiated from PD by the presenting features of cognitive impairment in DLB, compared with the variable onset of cognitive impairment occurring 1 year or more after established motor onset in PD. Thus, diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB are similar to that of PD and have important implications for maintaining patient independence and providing support for caregivers because motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric symptoms have an additive effect on patient functional disability.                                         SUMMARY               A careful history and physical examination are often needed to accurately diagnose and treat the heterogeneous cognitive and behavioral symptoms of PD and DLB. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment in PD and DLB are important, as these are a considerable source of patient disability and caregiver burden.},

Referral questions, principles of evaluation, and common instruments to detect abnormalities in cognition and behavior in this population are reviewed. The integration of neuropsychological test findings with other clinical and biomarker information enhances early detection, differential diagnosis, and care planning.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Life expectancy is increasing in the United States, and, accordingly, the prevalence and incidence of dementia associated with age-related neurodegenerative brain disease are rising. Age is the greatest risk factor for the dementia associated with Alzheimer disease, the most common neurodegenerative cause of dementia in people over 65 years of age; other etiologies, such as the class of frontotemporal lobar degenerations, are increasingly recognized in individuals both younger and older than 65 years of age. The clinical dementia diagnosis, unfortunately, is imperfectly related to disease etiology; however, probabilistic relationships can aid in diagnosis. Further, mounting evidence from postmortem brain autopsies points to multiple etiologies. The case examples in this article illustrate how the neuropsychological evaluation increases diagnostic accuracy and, most important, identifies salient cognitive and behavioral symptoms to target for nonpharmacologic intervention and caregiver education and support. Sharing the diagnosis with affected individuals is also discussed with reference to prognosis and severity of illness.

This article defines and describes LGMDs, delineates a diagnostic strategy, and discusses treatment of the LGMDs.                                         recent findings               In 2018, the definition of the LGMDs was further refined, and a new nomenclature was proposed. Diagnosis of the LGMDs was long guided by the distinctive clinical characteristics of each particular subtype but now integrates use of genetics---with next-generation sequencing panels, exomes, and full genome analysis---early in the diagnostic assessment. Appreciation of the phenotypic diversity of each LGMD subtype continues to expand. This emphasizes the need for precision genetic diagnostics to better understand each subtype and formulate appropriate management for individual patients. Of significant relevance, the explosion of research into therapeutic options accentuates the need for accurate diagnosis, comprehensive disease characterization, and description of the natural histories of the LGMDs to move the field forward and to mitigate disease impact on patients with LGMD.                                         summary               The LGMDs are genetic muscle diseases that superficially appear similar to one another but have important differences in rates of progression and concomitant comorbidities.

Epidemiologic and neurobiological data are reviewed as well as common associated symptoms, including sleep disruption, and treatment approaches to these conditions.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                PTSD is no longer considered an anxiety-related disorder in the                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 classification and instead is associated with trauma/stressor-related disorders. PTSD symptoms are clustered into four domains including intrusive experiences, avoidance, mood, and arousal symptoms. Despite this reclassification, similarities exist in consideration of diagnosis, treatment, and comorbidities with anxiety disorders. PTSD and anxiety-related disorders are heterogeneous, which is reflected by the neural circuits involved in the genesis of symptoms that may vary across symptom domains. Treatment is likely to benefit from consideration of this heterogeneity.                              Research in animal models of fear and anxiety, as well as in humans, suggests that patients with PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder have difficulty accurately determining safety from danger and struggle to suppress fear in the presence of safety cues.               Empirically supported psychotherapies commonly involved exposure (fear extinction learning) and are recommended for PTSD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been shown to be effective in other anxiety-related disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly used in the treatment of PTSD and anxiety disorders in which pharmacologic intervention is supported. Treating sleep disruption including sleep apnea (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]), nightmares, and insomnia (preferably via psychotherapy) may improve symptoms of PTSD, as well as improve mood in anxiety disorders.                                         SUMMARY               PTSD has a lifetime prevalence that is close to 10\% and shares neurobiological features with anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are the most common class of mental conditions and are highly comorbid with other disorders; treatment considerations typically include cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacologic intervention. Developing technologies show some promise as treatment alternatives in the future.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The discovery of several neural autoantibodies and their antigenic targets has revolutionized the investigation and treatment of immune-mediated myelopathies. Detection of these serologic biomarkers can support or establish a diagnosis of an autoimmune myelopathy, and, in the case of paraneoplastic syndromes, indicate the likely presence of an underlying malignancy. Distinctive lesion patterns detected on spinal cord or brain MRI narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with acute or subacute inflammatory myelopathies, including those not associated with autoantibody markers.                                         SUMMARY               Immune-mediated myelopathies usually present acutely or subacutely and have a broad differential diagnosis. A systematic diagnostic approach using data from the clinical setting and presentation, MRI lesion patterns, CSF data, and autoantibody markers can differentiate these disorders from noninflammatory myelopathies, often with precise disease classification. This, in turn, provides prognostic information, especially whether the disorder is likely to relapse, and facilitates therapeutic decision making. Diagnostic accuracy informs selection of acute immunotherapy aimed at arresting and reversing recent neurologic injury and, when necessary, selection of long-term treatment for prevention of disease progression or relapse.},

Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to responsive behaviors are discussed. Practical treatment strategies are applied to common behavioral symptoms.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Aggressive and agitated behavior is common in dementia. Behavioral symptoms lead to reduced quality of life and distress for both patients and caregivers. They can also lead to poor outcomes and are associated with significant financial implications for the individual and health care system. A wide range of difficult behaviors exists, with limited evidence for deciding on treatment. Clinicians should integrate the available evidence with practical and commonsense strategies to target these difficult-to-treat behaviors.                                         SUMMARY               Treating aggression and agitation in dementia is challenging. Viewing behaviors as a response to either internal or external stimuli can help guide treatment. Treatment should emphasize nonpharmacologic approaches as an initial step, using practical and commonsense strategies. Caregivers and family should be actively involved in the planning and implementation of behavioral plans. It is essential to minimize both medical and nonmedical factors that may be contributing to behaviors. When pharmacologic options are required, it is important to choose medications that will target specific behavioral goals, having both practical consideration and the best evidence in mind.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Neoplastic myelopathies are uncommon neurologic disorders but cause significant morbidity when they occur. Primary spinal cord tumors can be classified into intramedullary, intradural extramedullary, or extradural tumors. Diffuse gliomas and ependymal tumors are the most common intramedullary tumors. Diffuse gliomas include the World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III astrocytomas, the grade II and grade III oligodendrogliomas, the grade IV glioblastomas, and newly recognized pediatric diffuse midline gliomas with H3 K27M mutation. The majority of diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas are                 IDH                 -mutant tumors, whereas only 10\% of glioblastomas are                 IDH                 -mutant. Oligodendrogliomas are typically                 IDH                 -mutant and are characterized by the molecular signature of 1p/19q codeletion. Nine distinct molecular subgroups of ependymomas have been identified based on their genetic features and location.                 NF2                 mutations are frequently found in spinal cord ependymomas. Metastatic tumors are the most common tumors of the spine and can be extradural, leptomeningeal, or, rarely, intramedullary. Extradural metastatic spinal cord compression is a neurologic emergency and should be promptly diagnosed as pretreatment neurologic status dictates the posttreatment outcome.                                                        SUMMARY               Neoplastic myelopathies encompass many diagnoses ranging from benign and malignant spinal tumors to paraneoplastic syndromes heralding cancers. The knowledge of the clinical features and management of neoplastic myelopathies is essential to practicing neurologists as early diagnosis and treatment can prevent devastating neurologic sequelae.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               Cardioembolic stroke accounts for nearly 30\% of ischemic strokes. Prompt diagnosis of the underlying mechanism may improve secondary prevention strategies. This article reviews recent randomized trials, observational studies, case reports, and guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of cardioembolic stroke.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Several pathologies can lead to cardioembolic stroke, including atrial fibrillation, aortic arch atheroma, patent foramen ovale, left ventricular dysfunction, and many others. Secondary stroke prevention strategies differ across these heterogeneous mechanisms. In addition to medical treatment advances such as the use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation, surgical treatments such as closure of patent foramen ovale have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in select patients. Furthermore, left atrial appendage occlusion is a promising strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation who are candidates for short-term oral anticoagulation therapy but not long-term oral anticoagulation therapy.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               A thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential to determine cardioembolic causes of stroke. In addition to risk factor management and lifestyle modifications, identification and targeting of the underlying cardioembolic stroke mechanisms will lead to improved stroke prevention strategies in patients with cardioembolic stroke.},

Recent studies have shown vascular myelopathies are frequently misdiagnosed as transverse myelitis, and recognition of this diagnostic pitfall is important. Many different vascular mechanisms can cause myelopathy; this article provides a comprehensive review that simplifies disease categories into arterial ischemia, venous congestion/ischemia, hematomyelia, and extraparenchymal hemorrhage.

Several medications have been shown to be effective in treating neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, and these medications are often used to treat neuropathic pain associated with other conditions as well. This article summarizes the diagnosis and assessment of patients with neuropathic pain as well as available pharmacologic and interventional treatment options.                                         Recent Findings:               Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of neuropathic pain have been published, and first-line medications include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, topical agents, as well as opioid analgesics. Interventional options include anesthetic and steroid injections, nerve blocks, and spinal cord stimulation. Essential to the treatment algorithm of neuropathic pain is the assessment and treatment of psychosocial comorbidities and the utilization of a multidisciplinary team approach, including cognitive-behavioral and rehabilitative therapies. Questions remain about the comparative effectiveness of various medications and combination therapies. Increasing interest also exists in the optimization and personalization of pharmacotherapy based upon the underlying mechanism(s) of neuropathic pain according to the quality of the patient's symptoms.                                         Summary:               The management of chronic neuropathic pain is challenging and is best achieved with the use of a multidisciplinary team.

RECENT FINDINGS                                Although improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis and management of CNS TB have occurred over the past 50 years, the emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB, the advent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the subsequent availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy that can produce the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome have complicated the diagnosis and treatment of CNS TB. Advances in diagnostic assays promise to increase the speed of diagnosis as well as the percentage of people with a confirmed rather than a presumptive diagnosis. Advances in precision medicine have identified polymorphisms in the                 LTA4H                 gene that influence the risk for inflammation in patients with tuberculous meningitis.

Newer diagnostic assays promise to increase the speed of diagnosis and improve appropriate selection of antituberculous therapy and anti-inflammatory medications. Despite these advances, CNS TB remains difficult to diagnose, and clinicians should have a low threshold for initiating empiric therapy in patients with presumptive infection.},
