  abstract = {Proinflammatory cytokines have been identified in herniated intervertebral discs in humans, and such cytokines have experimentally been demonstrated to be important in the pathophysiological mechanisms of disc herniation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta IL-6, IL-8, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were investigated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique in 39 patients with lumbar disc herniation and sciatica. Pain duration and pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) were recorded at inclusion, and a clinical examination was performed evaluating neurological findings. The extent of disc herniation (protrusion or extrusion/sequestration) was evaluated perioperatively. Normal concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were present in CSF and serum in almost all patients with lumbar disc herniation. The concentrations of IL-8 in CSF were increased in 12 out of 39 patients, and these increased levels of IL-8 correlated to a short duration of pain and to more pronounced herniation (extrusion or sequestration). No relationship between IL-8 concentrations in CSF and pain intensity, positive neurological findings or a positive straight leg-raising (SLR) test was found. The observation of increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF in patients with a short duration of symptoms supports the concept of the initial involvement of inflammatory mechanisms after a disc herniation. The finding that most of the patients with increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF had an extrusion or a sequestration may suggest that the increase in IL-8 is related to mechanical nerve root compression, but may also indicate a biochemical effect exerted by the herniated disc on the surrounding tissue. Further studies on the potential role of IL-8 as a biomarker for disc herniation are warranted.},

  abstract = {Degeneration of the intervertebral discs (IVDs) is a major contributor to back, neck and radicular pain. IVD degeneration is characterized by increases in levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6 and IL-17 secreted by the IVD cells; these cytokines promote extracellular matrix degradation, chemokine production and changes in IVD cell phenotype. The resulting imbalance in catabolic and anabolic responses leads to the degeneration of IVD tissues, as well as disc herniation and radicular pain. The release of chemokines from degenerating discs promotes the infiltration and activation of immune cells, further amplifying the inflammatory cascade. Leukocyte migration into the IVD is accompanied by the appearance of microvasculature tissue and nerve fibres. Furthermore, neurogenic factors, generated by both disc and immune cells, induce expression of pain-associated cation channels in the dorsal root ganglion. Depolarization of these ion channels is likely to promote discogenic and radicular pain, and reinforce the cytokine-mediated degenerative cascade. Taken together, an enhanced understanding of the contribution of cytokines and immune cells to these catabolic, angiogenic and nociceptive processes could provide new targets for the treatment of symptomatic disc disease. In this Review, the role of key inflammatory cytokines during each of the individual phases of degenerative disc disease, as well as the outcomes of major clinical studies aimed at blocking cytokine function, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is the pathological basis of disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and other related diseases, and the lower back pain it produces lays a heavy financial burden on individuals and society. Thus, it is essential to comprehend IVDD's pathophysiology. Numerous factors, such as inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, apoptosis, matrix metalloproteinases, are linked to IVDD pathogenesis. Despite the fact that many researches has provided explanations for the pathophysiology of IVDD, these studies are typically singular, restricted, and isolated, expound only on one or two components, and do not systematically analyze and summarize the numerous influencing elements. In addition, we discovered that the incidence of many chronic diseases in the field of orthopedics may be thoroughly and systematically defined in terms of immunological systems. In order to provide a theoretical foundation for an in-depth understanding of the pathological process of IVDD and the formulation of more effective prevention and treatment measures, this review provides a comprehensive and systematic account of the pathogenesis of IVDD from the physical to the molecular barriers of the intervertebral disc, from the nucleus pulposus tissue to the cellular to the immune-molecular level.},
