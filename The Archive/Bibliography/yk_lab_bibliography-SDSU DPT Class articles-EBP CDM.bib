  abstract = {Background Football is a highly competitive sport, and participants can experience various contact and non-contact sports injuries in the sporting process. In any elite sport, screening players using different scientific tools is an important injury prevention strategy. The Y- Balance test (YBT) was found to be a predictive tool for non-contact injury. However, the use of criteria from these tests to predict injuries has not been substantiated and should be further investigated. Purpose The aim~of this study was to determine the predictors for injury among athletes using baseline YBT, number of matches, and minutes of physical activity; the cutoff scores for predictors of injury, including baseline YBT, number of matches, and minutes of physical activity; and~the clinical prediction rules for predicting injury in this population. Methods A total of 39 young student football players were included in this study. The mean age was 20.28 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.83 kg/m2. A baseline assessment of the participant's characteristics was taken and each participant performed the YBT once before starting the league. After the university league football players had finished their tournament, we asked them questions related to non-contact injuries. Results The results showed that the prevalence of injury was 17.95\% among this population. An increase in the YBT score was significantly associated with a decrease in the odds of having an injury [odds ratio (OR) 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.94 (0.88, 0.99), p = 0.047). In addition, the number of matches was significantly associated with an increase in the odds of having an injury p = 0.012. However, the minutes of physical activity were not statistically significant p = 0.065.~The highest Youden index was {$\leq$}97.89, with a sensitivity of 87.50\% and specificity of 71.43\%, for the posterior medial reach and {$\leq$}92.88, with a sensitivity of 90.62\% and specificity of 57.14\%, for the posterior lateral reach.~The clinical prediction rule was an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88. Conclusions The results of the study provide evidence for the potential utility of the YBT as a predictor tool for evaluating non-contact injuries in university league football players. By identifying players with lower YBT scores who were at higher risk for injury, targeted interventions could be implemented to address functional movement deficits and potentially reduce injury risk.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Return-to-activity (RTA) assessments are commonly administered after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) to manage the patient's postoperative progressions back to activity. To date, few data are available on the clinical utility of these assessments to predict patient outcomes such as secondary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury once the athlete has returned to activity. OBJECTIVE: To identify the measures of patient function at 6 months post-ACLR that best predict RTA and second ACL injury at a minimum of 2 years after ACLR. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 patients with primary, unilateral ACLR completed functional assessments at approximately 6 months post-ACLR. Of these, 192 (82.1\%) completed follow-up at {$\geq$}2 years post-ACLR. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The 6-month functional assessments consisted of patient-reported outcomes, isokinetic knee-flexor and -extensor strength, and single-legged hopping. We collected RTA and secondary ACL injury data at {$\geq$}2 years after ACLR. RESULTS: Of the patients who were able to RTA (n = 155), 44 (28.4\%) had a subsequent ACL injury, 24 (15.5\%) to the ipsilateral graft ACL and 20 (12.9\%) to the contralateral ACL. A greater proportion of females had a secondary injury to the contralateral ACL (15/24, 62.5\%), whereas a greater proportion of males reinjured the ipsilateral ACL graft (15/20, 75.0\%; P = .017). Greater knee-extension symmetry at 6 months increased the probability of reinjury (B = 0.016, P = .048). Among patients with RTA at {$<$}8 months, every 1\% increase in quadriceps strength symmetry at 6 months increased the risk of reinjury by 2.1\% (B = 0.021, P = .05). Among patients with RTA at {$>$}8 months, every month that RTA was delayed reduced the risk of reinjury by 28.4\% (B = -0.284, P = .042). Descriptive statistics of patient function stratified between the early and delayed RTA groups can be found in the Supplemental Table (available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0407.20.S1). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with more symmetric quadriceps strength at 6 months post-ACLR were more likely to experience another ACL rupture, especially those who returned to sport at {$<$}8 months after the index surgery. Clinicians should be cognizant that returning high-functioning patients to activity at {$<$}8 months post-ACLR may place them at an increased risk for reinjury.},

  abstract = {Multiligament knee injuries are complex injuries that must be addressed with a comprehensive diagnostic workup and treatment plan. Multiligament injuries are commonly observed with concomitant meniscal, chondral, and neurovascular injuries, requiring a thorough clinical assessment and radiographic evaluation. Due to the higher failure rates associated with knee ligament repair following multiligament knee injury, the current literature favors single-stage anatomic knee reconstructions. Recent studies have also optimized graft sequencing and reconstruction tunnel orientation to prevent graft elongation and reduce the risk of tunnel convergence. In addition, anatomic-based ligament reconstruction techniques and the usage of suture anchors now allow for early postoperative knee motion without the risk of stretching out the graft. Rehabilitation following multiligament knee reconstruction should begin on postoperative day one and typically requires 9-12 months. The purpose of this article is to review the latest principles of the surgically relevant anatomy, biomechanics, evaluation, treatment, rehabilitation, and outcomes of multiligament knee injuries.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a four-stage plyometric program to be undertaken as part of criterion-based rehabilitation for athletes with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). After ACLR, the patient experiences alterations of joint mobility, gait and movement patterns, neuromuscular function and general physical fitness. Plyometric training is an important component for neuromuscular and movement re-conditioning after ACLR. Effective use of plyometrics can support enhancements in explosive sporting performance, movement quality and lower risk of injury. Plyometric training, as a component of the ACL functional recovery process, can aid in restoring function and supporting timely return to sport. However, few patients undertake or complete a plyometric program prior to return-to-sport. To truly impact individual patients, a stronger focus on research implementation is needed from researchers to translate efficacious interventions into practice. In designing a plyometric program, it is important to match the specific plyometric tasks to the functional recovery status of the ACLR patient. To do this, it is important to understand the relative intensity of plyometrics tasks, align these tasks to the ACL functional recovery process and monitor the athlete as part of criterion based rehabilitation. Plyometric intensity is based on the intensity of efforts, the vertical and/or horizontal momentum prior to ground contact, the ground contact time and the surface or environment on which they are performed on/in. Furthermore, how the person technically performs the task will influence joint loading. There should be a gradual increase in task intensity and specificity throughout the program, with all tasks used for both neuromuscular and motor control re-conditioning. The aim of this paper is to provide recommendations to clinicians on how to design and implement plyometric training programs for the ACLR patient, as part of the functional recovery process.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical therapy (PT) rehabilitation is critical to successful outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Later-stage rehabilitation, including sport-specific exercises, is increasingly recognized for restoring high-level knee function. However, supervised PT visits have historically been concentrated during the early stages of recovery after ACLR. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the number and temporal utilization of PT visits after ACLR in a national cohort. We hypothesized that PT visits would be concentrated early in the postoperative period. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiological study. METHODS: The Humana PearlDiver database was searched to identify patients who underwent ACLR between 2007 and 2017. Patients with additional structures treated were excluded. The mean {\textpm} SD, median and interquartile range (IQR), and range of number of PT visits for each patient were determined for the 52 weeks after ACLR. PT visits over time were also assessed in relation to patient age and sex. RESULTS: In total, 11,518 patients who underwent ACLR met the inclusion criteria; the mean age was 32.62 {\textpm} 13.70 years, and 42.7\% were female patients. Of this study cohort, 10,381 (90.4\%) had documented PT postoperatively; the range of PT visits was 0 to 121. On average, patients had 16.90 {\textpm} 10.60 PT visits (median [IQR], 16 [9-22]) after ACLR. Patients completed a mean of 52\% of their PT visits in the first 6 weeks, 75\% in the first 10 weeks, and 90\% in the first 16 weeks after surgery. Patients aged 10 to 19 years had the highest number of PT visits (mean {\textpm} SD, 19.67 {\textpm} 12.09; median [IQR], 18 [12-25]), significantly greater than other age groups (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: PT after ACLR is concentrated in the early postoperative period. Physicians, therapists, and patients may consider adjusting the limited access to PT to optimize patient recovery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As supervised PT visits may be limited, the appropriate temporal utilization of supervised PT visits must be maximized. Strategies to ensure sessions for later neuromuscular and activity-specific rehabilitation are needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meniscal injuries are commonly associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. Treatment of meniscal injuries can impart delayed weightbearing and range of motion restrictions, which can affect the rehabilitation protocol. The effect of meniscal treatment and subsequent restrictions on strength recovery after ACL reconstruction is unclear. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to compare strength, jumping performance, and patient-reported outcomes between patients who underwent isolated ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and those who underwent surgical intervention for meniscal pathology at the time of ACLR. Our hypothesis was that patients who underwent concurrent meniscal repair (MR) would have lower strength recovery owing to postoperative restrictions. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Patients with ACLR were stratified into isolated ACLR, ACLR and meniscectomy (ACLR-MS), or ACLR-MR groups and were compared with healthy controls. The ACLR-MR group was restricted to partial weightbearing and to 90{$^\circ$} of knee flexion for the first 6 weeks postoperatively. All participants completed patient-reported outcomes (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and underwent bilateral isokinetic and isometric strength tests of the knee extensor and flexor groups as part of a return-to-sports test battery at 5 to 7 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients with ACLR (50 with isolated ACLR, 44 with ACLR-MS, and 71 with ACLR-MR) and 140 healthy controls were included in the study. Follow-up occurred at a mean of 5.96 {\textpm} 0.47 months postoperatively. The control group demonstrated higher subjective knee function, unilateral peak extensor torque, and limb symmetry than did the ACLR-MS and ACLR-MR groups combined (P {$<$} .001 for all). There were no differences in IKDC, KOOS subscales, or unilateral or limb symmetry measures of peak knee extensor or flexor torque among the isolated ACLR, ACLR-MS, and ACLR-MR groups. CONCLUSION: Persistent weakness, asymmetry, and reduced subjective outcome scores at 6-month follow-up after ACLR were not influenced by meniscal treatment. These findings suggested that the weightbearing and range of motion restrictions associated with meniscal repair recovery do not result in loss of early strength or worse patient-reported outcomes.},

DESIGN: Overview of systematic reviews with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Library. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials investigating rehabilitation interventions following ACL and/or meniscal tears in young adults. RESULTS: We included 22 systematic reviews (142 trials of mostly men) evaluating ACL-injured individuals and none evaluating isolated meniscal injuries. We synthesised data from 16 reviews evaluating 12 different interventions. Moderate-certainty evidence was observed for: (1) neuromuscular electrical stimulation to improve quadriceps strength; (2) open versus closed kinetic chain exercises to be similarly effective for quadriceps strength and self-reported function; (3) structured home-based versus structured in-person rehabilitation to be similarly effective for quadriceps and hamstring strength and self-reported function; and (4) postoperative knee bracing being ineffective for physical function and laxity. There was low-certainty evidence that: (1) preoperative exercise therapy improves self-reported and physical function postoperatively; (2) cryotherapy reduces pain and analgesic use; (3) psychological interventions improve anxiety/fear; and (4) whole body vibration improves quadriceps strength. There was very low-certainty evidence that: (1) protein-based supplements improve quadriceps size; (2) blood flow restriction training improves quadriceps size; (3) neuromuscular control exercises improve quadriceps and hamstring strength and self-reported function; and (4) continuous passive motion has no effect on range of motion. CONCLUSION: The general level of evidence for rehabilitation after ACL or meniscal tear was low. Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that several rehabilitation types can improve quadriceps strength, while brace use has no effect on knee function/laxity.},

Associations between return to sport and variables representing knee impairment, function and psychological status have not been well studied in athletes following ACLR. PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to summarise the literature reporting on variables proposed to be associated with return to sport following ACLR. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane databases were searched for articles published before November 2012. Articles included in this review met these criteria: (1) included patients with primary ACLR, (2) reported at least one knee impairment, function or psychological measure, (3) reported a return to sport measure and (4) analysed the relationship between the measure and return to sport. RESULTS: Weak evidence existed in 16 articles suggesting variables associated with return to sport included higher quadriceps strength, less effusion, less pain, greater tibial rotation, higher Marx Activity score, higher athletic confidence, higher preoperative knee self-efficacy, lower kinesiophobia and higher preoperative self-motivation. CONCLUSIONS: Weak evidence supports an association between knee impairment, functional and psychological variables and return to sport. Current return to sport guidelines should be updated to reflect all variables associated with return to sport. Utilising evidence-based return to sport guidelines following ACLR may ensure that athletes are physically and psychologically capable of sports participation, which may reduce reinjury rates and the need for subsequent surgery.},

Conclusions: Physical scar management demonstrates moderate-to-strong effects on improvement of scar issues as related to signs and symptoms. These results show the importance of specific physical management of scar tissue.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft failure and contralateral ACL tears are more frequent in children and adolescents than adults. The reasons for higher subsequent injury rates in this population are incompletely understood. METHODS: We analyzed a continuous cohort of patients who were {$<$}18 years of age. Subjects underwent isolated, primary ACL reconstruction with autograft between 2006 and January 1, 2014, and had a minimum 2-year follow-up. Return-to-sport characteristics were described, and multivariable Cox regression modeling was used to identify predictors of a second ACL injury. Candidate variables included patient factors (age, sex, physeal status, tibial slope, notch width index), surgical characteristics (graft type, surgical technique), measures of recovery (time to return to sport, duration of physical therapy), and patients' preoperative and postoperative sports involvement (primary and secondary sports, number of sports). RESULTS: A total of 112 subjects met inclusion criteria; of these patients, 85 (76\%) had complete follow-up data and were analyzed. The mean age (and standard deviation) was 13.9 {\textpm} 2.1 years (range, 6 to 17 years); 77\% had open physes. The mean follow-up was 48.3 {\textpm} 15.3 months. Seventy-seven patients (91\%) returned to sports, and 84\% returned to the same sport. The mean Marx activity score at the time of the latest follow-up was 13.7 {\textpm} 3.5 points. Patients were involved in fewer sports after ACL reconstruction, 1.48 {\textpm} 0.92 compared with 1.83 {\textpm} 1.01 sports before reconstruction (p = 0.002). Sixteen patients (19\%) sustained an ACL graft rupture, 11 patients (13\%) sustained a contralateral ACL tear, and 1 of these patients (1\%) sustained both. The overall prevalence of a second ACL injury was 32\%. Time to return to sport was the only significant predictor of a second ACL injury, with a slower return being protective (hazard ratio per month, 0.87 [95\% confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.99]; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric athletes return to sports at a high rate (91\%) after ACL reconstruction. Unfortunately, the prevalence of a second ACL injury is high at 32\%. Within this population, an earlier return to sport is predictive of a second ACL injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

  abstract = {There is a growing body of evidence documenting loads applied to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) for weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing exercises. ACL loading has been quantified by inverse dynamics techniques that measure anterior shear force at the tibiofemoral joint (net force primarily restrained by the ACL), ACL strain (defined as change in ACL length with respect to original length and expressed as a percentage) measured directly in vivo, and ACL tensile force estimated through mathematical modeling and computer optimization techniques. A review of the biomechanical literature indicates the following: ACL loading is generally greater with non-weight-bearing compared to weight-bearing exercises; with both types of exercises, the ACL is loaded to a greater extent between 10{$^\circ$} to 50{$^\circ$} of knee flexion (generally peaking between 10{$^\circ$} and 30{$^\circ$}) compared to 50{$^\circ$} to 100{$^\circ$} of knee flexion; and loads on the ACL change according to exercise technique (such as trunk position). Squatting with excessive forward movement of the knees beyond the toes and with the heels off the ground tends to increase ACL loading. Squatting and lunging with a forward trunk tilt tend to decrease ACL loading, likely due to increased hamstrings activity. During seated knee extension, ACL force decreases when the resistance pad is positioned more proximal on the anterior aspect of the lower leg, away from the ankle. The evidence reviewed as part of this manuscript provides objective data by which to rank exercises based on loading applied to the ACL. The biggest challenge in exercise selection post-ACL reconstruction is the limited knowledge of the optimal amount of stress that should be applied to the ACL graft as it goes through its initial incorporation and eventual maturation process. Clinicians may utilize this review as a guide to exercise selection and rehabilitation progression for patients post-ACL reconstruction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the predictive value of return to sport (RTS) test batteries applied after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is limited. Adding assessment of psychological readiness has been recommended, but knowledge of how this affects the predictive ability of test batteries is lacking. PURPOSE: To examine the predictive ability of a RTS test battery on return to preinjury level of sport and reinjury when evaluation of psychological readiness was incorporated. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 129 patients were recruited 9 months after ACLR. Inclusion criteria were age {$\geq$}16\,years and engagement in sports before injury. Patients with concomitant ligamentous surgery or ACL revision surgery were excluded. Baseline testing included single-leg hop tests, isokinetic strength tests, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form 2000, a custom-made RTS questionnaire, and the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale. The RTS criteria were IKDC 2000 score {$\geq$}85\% and {$\geq$}85\% leg symmetry index on hop and strength test. At a 2-year follow-up evaluation, further knee surgery and reinjuries were registered and the RTS questionnaire was completed again. Regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to study the predictive ability of the test battery. RESULTS: Out of the 103 patients who completed the 2-year follow-up, 42\% returned to their preinjury level of sport. ACL-RSI 9 months after surgery (odds ratio [OR], 1.03) and age (OR, 1.05) predicted RTS. An ACL-RSI score {$<$}47 indicated that a patient was at risk of not returning to sport (area under the curve 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.58-0.79), with 85\% sensitivity and 45\% specificity. The functional tests did not predict RTS. Six patients sustained ACL reinjuries and 7 underwent surgery for other knee complaints/injuries after RTS testing. None of the 29 patients who passed all RTS criteria, and were therefore cleared for RTS, sustained a second knee injury. CONCLUSION: ACL-RSI and age were predictors of 2-year RTS, while functional tests were not informative. Another main finding was that none of the patients who passed the 85\% RTS criteria sustained another knee injury.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While return to sport (RTS) in young athletes after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has been well studied, little is known regarding their rate of RTS after multiligament knee injury (MLKI). PURPOSE: To assess the level of and factors associated with RTS after MLKI in young athletes. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 116 patients aged {$\leq$}23 years who had sustained an injury to {$\geq$}2 knee ligaments and undergone operative reconstruction or repair of {$\geq$}1 ligament. Our primary outcome was self-reported RTS at the preinjury level or higher. We estimated the likelihood of RTS using binomial logistic regression. Secondary variables included the 2000 International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SF), ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI), and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) physical and mental health summaries. RESULTS: A total of 30 (25.9\%) patients (24 men, 6 women; mean age, 18.1 {\textpm} 2.5 years) completed patient-reported outcome surveys at a mean follow-up of 7.8 years (median, 6.6 years [range, 1.1-19.5 years]). A total of 28 patients underwent surgical treatment of {$\geq$}2 ligaments. RTS was achieved by 90\% of patients, and 43.3\% returned to their preinjury level or higher. Patients who had played sports at a higher level before injury were more likely to RTS at their preinjury level or higher (odds ratio [OR], 3.516 [95\% CI, 1.034-11.955]; P = .044), while those who played cutting sports were less likely to do so (OR, 0.013 [95\% CI, 0.000-0.461; P = .017). Patients who achieved RTS at their preinjury level or higher had significantly higher IKDC-SF and ACL-RSI scores versus patients who did not (P = .001 and P = .002, respectively). The number of ligaments injured, age, mental health diagnosis, and SF-12 scores were not associated with the ability to RTS at the preinjury or higher levels. CONCLUSION: Most young athletes who sustained MLKI were able to return to play at some level, but a minority returned to their preinjury level. Patients who did return at preinjury or higher levels had higher IKDC-SF and ACL-RSI scores than those who did not. Performance in cutting and/or pivoting sports was negatively associated with RTS.},

The purpose of the present review is to identify currently available patient-reported outcome questionnaires for patients with ACL injuries, to appraise and assess the methodological quality and psychometric evidence of the evaluations of identified instruments, and to summarize the overall evidence for each included questionnaire. Methods: A computerized literature search was performed to identify articles appropriate for inclusion in this systematic review. Search terms were related to outcome instruments, ACL injuries, and psychometric properties. Two independent reviewers assessed the suitability of articles for inclusion. The methodological quality of instrument evaluation was assessed with use of the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Psychometric properties were assessed with use of the quality criteria established by Terwee et al. The 2 assessments were synthesized to obtain an overall rating of the psychometric evidence for each questionnaire. Results: Forty-one studies investigating 24 instruments were included. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Form and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were the most frequently assessed instruments. The ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACLRSI) scale had 6 properties with positive evidence and was the highestquality instrument overall. Conclusions: Many of the included studies had low COSMIN ratings. The ACL-RSI is a reliable and valid scale to measure outcomes for patients with ACL injuries. Further assessments with improved methodological quality are needed to determine the psychometric properties of other instruments.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This article aims to evaluate patterns of chronic multiligament injuries and outcomes of treatment with single-stage reconstruction using autografts. METHODS: All patients with clinicoradiologically diagnosed multiligament knee injury (MKI) were included in this prospective observational study. As the time since injury was more than 6\,weeks in all of the patients, they were categorized as having chronic MKI. Patients were assessed clinically for laxity, and the diagnosis was confirmed radiologically. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for medial collateral ligament (MCL) or posterolateral corner reconstruction in a patient with Schenck knee dislocation (KD) type III. In these cases, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were reconstructed by using the peroneus longus and contralateral hamstring tendons respectively. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for ACL reconstruction and an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft was used for reconstruction of the PCL in a KD type II injury. In two cases of KD type IV injury, the lateral laxity was only grade II and was managed conservatively; the rest of the ligaments were addressed like a KD type III injury. Outcome evaluation was done using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level, preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 years' follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients of mean age 33.48\,{\textpm}\,9.9\,years with MKI were included in the study. The patients were classified as eight KD type II, 17 KD type III, and two KD type IV. The majority of the patients had associated meniscal (59.2\%) or chondral (40.7\%) injuries. At the 2\,years' follow-up visit, there were significant improvements in VAS score (p\,=\,0.0001) IKDC score (p\,=\,0.0001), Lysholm score (p\,=\,0.0001), and range of motion (p\,=\,0.001). None of the patients had residual laxity on clinical examination of the knee joint at the 2 years' follow-up. All but two of the patients went back to their previous activity level. These two patients had progressive knee arthritis and needed knee arthroplasty. CONCLUSION: Single-stage surgical reconstruction for chronic MKI has favourable functional outcomes.

There is sparse evidence to guide return to sport (RTS) decisions in this population. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between knee reinjury after ACL reconstruction and (1) return to level I sports, (2) timing of RTS and (3) knee function prior to return. METHODS: 106 patients who participated in pivoting sports participated in this prospective 2-year cohort study. Sports participation and knee reinjury were recorded monthly. Knee function was assessed with the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale, global rating scale of function, and quadriceps strength and hop test symmetry. Pass RTS criteria were defined as scores {$>$}90 on all tests, failure as failing any. RESULTS: Patients who returned to level I sports had a 4.32 (p=0.048) times higher reinjury rate than those who did not. The reinjury rate was significantly reduced by 51\% for each month RTS was delayed until 9\>months after surgery, after which no further risk reduction was observed. 38.2\% of those who failed RTS criteria suffered reinjuries versus 5.6\% of those who passed (HR 0.16, p=0.075). More symmetrical quadriceps strength prior to return significantly reduced the knee reinjury rate. CONCLUSIONS: Returning to level I sports after ACL reconstruction leads to a more than 4-fold increase in reinjury rates over 2\>years. RTS 9\>months or later after surgery and more symmetrical quadriceps strength prior to return substantially reduce the reinjury rate.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL) commonly occurs during sporting events. It causes pain, instability and reduction in range of movement of the knee which results in altered balance, reduced strength as well as loading to the involved knee. The challenge to get the patient back to competitive sports level much depends on the rehabilitation process. Post ACLR rehabilitation is challenging due to the long rehabilitation time as well as boring repetitive exercises. The aim of this study is to compare between the effectiveness of using immersive virtual reality (PlayStation VR) in addition to the conventional rehabilitation as an aid in rehabilitation of patients after ACLR in terms of objective functional assessment and pain and subjective knee function scoring. METHODS: This randomised controlled trial was undertaken in a tertiary hospital in Malaysia from July 2019 until July 2020. Thirty patients were randomised into a group undergoing purely conventional rehabilitation (Group 1) and a group undergoing both conventional rehabilitation and immersive virtual reality assisted rehabilitation (Group 2). The immersive virtual reality assisted rehabilitation was started at 3 months post operatively for 3 months duration. Limb loading, balance, range of motion, functional hop tests of the knee, pain and subjective scoring of the knee with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Scores were measured preoperatively and at 6 months. RESULTS: There were significant differences in terms of improvement of pain scores (p~=~0.012) as well as IKDC Scores (p~=~0.024) in Group 2 as compared to Group 1. However, there were no significant differences with regards to limb loading, balance, range of motion and functional hop tests of the knee (p~{$>~$}0.05). No adverse events were observed during the study period. CONCLUSION: Immersive virtual reality can be used as an adjunct in rehabilitation of patients after ACL reconstruction in terms of improving their pain as well as their subjective knee evaluation. Large randomised control trial is recommended to further investigate the efficacy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early operative treatment of combined anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligament injuries has frequently led to motion complications and slow quadriceps muscle power gains. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of early repair or nonoperative treatment of a concomitant medial collateral ligament injury on range of motion of the knee and quadriceps muscle strength in patients with combined injuries. METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive patients with combined anterior cruciate and grade-III medial collateral ligament injuries were randomized into two groups. The medial collateral ligament was repaired in Group I (n = 23) and was treated nonoperatively in Group II (n = 24). In both groups, the torn anterior cruciate ligament was treated with early reconstruction. The patients were evaluated on the basis of sequential range-of-motion measurements, the one-leg-hop test, and isokinetic muscle power measurements at the time of follow-up, and the findings were compared between the two treatment groups. RESULTS: All patients achieved full knee extension. At all follow-up intervals the flexion deficit was greater in the group that had been managed with surgical repair of both ligaments, but the difference was significant only at six weeks (100 degrees compared with 112 degrees; p = 0.009), twelve weeks (119 degrees compared with 128 degrees; p = 0.043), and thirty-six weeks (130 degrees compared with 136 degrees; p = 0.011) after the operation. The difference between the groups was not significant at fifty-two weeks (132 degrees compared with 137 degrees) or 104 weeks (134 degrees compared with 137 degrees). The quadriceps muscle power deficit at fifty-two weeks was 30.7\% in the group that had been managed with combined repair and 20.5\% in the group that had been managed with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction only (p = 0.015). At 104 weeks, the deficits were 14.4\% and 9.7\%, respectively (p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Early operative treatment of combined anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligament injuries is possible without increased long-term mobilization complications. The rehabilitation period is long, and aggressive physiotherapy is recommended. However, nonoperative treatment of the torn medial collateral ligament allows faster restoration of flexion and quadriceps muscle power. Our results favor nonoperative treatment of the torn medial collateral ligament in patients with combined injuries.},

The purpose of this review is fourfold: (1) identify the risk factors and injuries associated with MLKI, (2) describe factors implicated in the treatment of MLKI, (3) report the effect of these risk factors on outcomes of MLKI, and (4) provide a brief insight into MLKI at our tertiary referral academic care center. This was a retrospective review of literature relevant to MLKI. Studies that described injuries, risk factors, treatment techniques, or outcomes associated with MLKI were included in our review. A total of 35 studies (consisting of level 3 and 4 evidence) published between 2009 and 2020 were found and included in our analysis. In addition, 25 patients who underwent treatment for MLKI at the University of Chicago Medical Center between December 2015 and December 2019 were included in our analysis. MLKI tend to occur in the younger male population. Increasing age, body mass index, and severity of the injury have been correlated with worse functional and patient-reported outcomes. Operative treatment is indicated for MLKI; however, timing and repair versus reconstruction is still debated, and is often decided on a patient by patient basis. Retrospective cohort studies have indicated that reconstruction may be favored; however, further more rigorous studies are needed to better characterize this finding. MLKIs are devastating injuries with significant variability in presentation, treatment, and outcome. Variations in these are largely attributable to the mechanism and severity of injury, timing, and surgeon preference. A holistic approach, and understanding of the present literature, is required to best optimize patient outcome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form was developed to measure change in symptoms, function, and sports activity in patients treated for a variety of knee conditions. Although previous research has demonstrated reliability and validity of the form, its responsiveness has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to determine responsiveness of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Patients who participated in the original validation study for the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form completed the form and a 7-level global rating of change scale that ranged from greatly worse to greatly better after a mean of 1.6 years (range, 0.5-2.3 years). Analyses included calculation of the standardized response mean and mean change in International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form score compared to the patient's perception of change on the global rating of change scale. In addition, a receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted to determine the change in score that best distinguished patients who improved from those who did not. RESULTS: The overall standardized response mean was 0.94, which is considered large. With the exception of those who were slightly worse or unchanged, the mean change in the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form score compared to the patients' perceived global ratings of change was as expected (greatly worse, -15.1; somewhat worse, -8.4; slightly worse, 20.6; no change, 10.7; slightly better, 5.9; somewhat better, 18.1; greatly better, 38.7). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a change score of 11.5 points had the highest sensitivity, and a change score of 20.5 points had the highest specificity to distinguish between those who were or were not improved. CONCLUSION: The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form is a responsive measure of symptoms, function, and sports activity for patients with a variety of knee conditions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We studied the effects of home interferential current therapy (IFC) on postoperative pain, range of motion, and edema in subjects undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, menisectomy, or knee chondroplasty. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary care outpatient orthopaedic clinic/ambulatory surgery center. SUBJECTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven subjects were separated into three groups based on their type of knee surgery and within each group randomized into a treatment or placebo group. INTERVENTIONS: All subjects received home IFC units. Subjects randomized to treatment group received a working IFC unit. Placebo subjects received units that were previously set to deliver no current. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Post-operative edema at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and weeks 1-8; range of motion at 1, 3, 6, and 9 weeks; pain immediately after surgery, at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and weeks 1-7; and amount of pain medication taken at days 1-10 were compared between treatment and placebo groups. RESULTS: All IFC subjects reported significantly less pain and had significantly greater range of motion at all post-operative time points. ACL and menisectomy IFC subjects experienced significantly less edema at all time points, while chondroplasty subjects experienced significantly less edema until 4 weeks postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that home IFC may help reduce pain, pain medication taken, and swelling while increasing range of motion in patients undergoing knee surgery. This could result in quicker return to activities of daily living and athletic activities.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Contralateral training in the early stages after surgery can improve the balance of the reconstructed knee, which is impaired following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, little is known about the neuromuscular cross exercise after ACLR. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of an 8-week cross exercise on balance and function of the reconstructed knee following ACLR. DESIGN: A single-blind randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty athletic males who underwent ACLR were randomly divided into intervention (n = 15) and control groups (n = 15). INTERVENTION: The intervention and control groups received a routine physiotherapy program. In addition, the intervention group performed neuromuscular exercises on the nonoperated limb. OUTCOME MEASURES: Before and 9~weeks after ACLR, dynamic and static balance, function, and pain in the reconstructed knee were measured by Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), stork balance stand test, balance error scoring system (BESS), Lysholm questionnaire, and visual analog scale. Data were analyzed by SPSS using 2-independent sample t test, paired t test, and analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Between-group comparison showed that, contralateral knee neuromuscular exercises significantly increased in the reaching distance in~SEBT in the anterior (P {$<$} .001), posterior (P {$<$} .001), posteromedial (P = .010), and posterolateral directions (P = .007), decreased the number of errors in 4 stance positions of BESS including single stance on the firm (P {$\leq$} .001) and foam surface (P {$\leq$} .001), and tandem stance on the firm (P = .028) and foam surface (P {$\leq$} .001). It also increased the time of standing of the stork stand test (P = .044) and decreased the pain intensity (P = .014). CONCLUSION: Neuromuscular exercise of the nonsurgical knee could improve the dynamic and static balance, and pain in the early stages following ACLR in the surgical leg. These findings may be potentially valuable for current rehabilitation protocols.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiligamentous knee injuries (MLKIs) are rare, and heterogeneous in presentation and treatment options. Consequently, optimal postoperative rehabilitation of MLKI remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the latest evidence for postoperative rehabilitation protocols following multiligamentous knee reconstruction (MLKR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multidatabase search was conducted with the aid of a health sciences librarian. Blinded reviewers conducted multiple screenings of studies evaluating postoperative rehabilitation protocols following MLKR. All included studies were then graded based on level of evidence, and data concerning patient demographics and rehabilitation protocols were extracted. RESULTS: MLKR rehabilitation protocols differ widely in terms of weightbearing, bracing, initiation, and types of physical therapy, yet several established protocols were referenced frequently throughout the literature. Such protocols resulted in good outcomes, with patients returning to running in 6 to 12 months and returning to sport in 8 to 12 months. CONCLUSION: The rare nature of MLKI hinders the ability to create a standardized rehabilitation protocol. However, early postoperative physical therapy and range of motion consistently lead to improved outcomes. Randomized studies are needed to determine optimal postoperative rehabilitation following MLKR.},

A Guideline Development Group systematically searched and reviewed evidence using randomised clinical trials and systematic reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions and guide clinicians and patients on the content of the optimal rehabilitation protocol after ACLR.The guideline targets patients during rehabilitation after ACLR and investigates the effectiveness of the available interventions to the physiotherapist, alone or in combination (eg, exercise, modalities, objective progression criteria). Exercise interventions should be considered the mainstay of ACLR rehabilitation. However, there is little evidence on the dose-response relationship between volume and/or intensity of exercise and outcomes. Physical therapy modalities can be helpful as an adjunct in the early phase of rehabilitation when pain, swelling and limitations in range of motion are present. Adding modalities in the early phase may allow earlier pain-free commencement of exercise rehabilitation. Return to running and return to training/activity are key milestones for rehabilitation after ACLR. However, there is no evidence on which progression or discharge criteria should be used.While there is a very low level of certainty for most components of rehabilitation, most of the recommendations provided in this guideline were agreed to by expert clinicians. This guideline also highlights several new elements of ACLR management not reported previously.},

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether a set of objective discharge criteria, including muscle strength and functional tests, are associated with risk of ACL graft rupture after RTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 158 male professional athletes who underwent an ACL reconstruction and returned to their previous professional level of sport were included. Before players returned to sport they underwent a battery of discharge tests (isokinetic strength testing at 60{$^\circ$}, 180{$^\circ$} and 300{$^\circ$}/s, a running t test, single hop, triple hop and triple crossover hop tests). Athletes were monitored for ACL re-ruptures once they returned to sport (median follow-up 646\>days, range 1-2060). RESULTS: Of the 158 athletes, 26 (16.5\%) sustained an ACL graft rupture an average of 105\>days after RTS. Two factors were associated with increased risk of ACL graft rupture: (1) not meeting all six of the discharge criteria before returning to team training (HR 4.1, 95\% CI 1.9 to 9.2, p{$\leq$}0.001); and (2) decreased hamstring to quadriceps ratio of the involved leg at 60{$^\circ$}/s (HR 10.6 per 10\% difference, 95\% CI 10.2 to 11, p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Athletes who did not meet the discharge criteria before returning to professional sport had a four times greater risk of sustaining an ACL graft rupture compared with those who met all six RTS criteria. In addition, hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio deficits were associated with an increased risk of an ACL graft rupture.},

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Ovid, EBMSCO-host, ScienceDirect, CNKI, VIP, WanFang Data and CBM were searched until 2nd October 2020. REVIEW METHODS: Trials with proprioceptive training for patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were included. Study screening, data extraction, risk of bias and quality assessments were performed independently by two researchers. We performed a stratified analysis based on the quality of the study. Sensitivity analyses were performed if the heterogeneity was high. RESULTS: Seventeen trials with 878 participants were included, and 12/17 with low quality. After stratified analysis, the pooled effect of high-quality studies showed significant improvement for proprioceptive training group in range of motion (P\,{$<$}\,0.05, I2\,=\,0\%), but no differences in Cincinnati knee rating system score (P\,{$>$}\,0.05, I2\,=\,83\%), hop test (P{$>$}0.05, I2\,=\,0\%) and proprioception (P\,=\,0.17, I2\,=\,77\%) compared to conventional training group; while the pooled effect of low-quality studies showed significant differences in knee functional improvement (P\,{$<$}\,0.00001, I2\,=\,69\%), but no difference in proprioception (P {$>$} 0.05, I2\,=\,84\%) between two groups. The pooled effect of all studies showed a significant benefit in both function and proprioception. CONCLUSION: The effects of proprioceptive training on knee functional and proprioceptive improvement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is mixed. It is more likely that proprioceptive training in high-quality studies has few detectable effects and that low-quality studies show an effect because of an unconscious bias. A large well designed high-quality study needs to be undertaken in the future.},

However, there is a lack of knowledge about the effects of running on sand on running biomechanics and muscle activities. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of sand training on running mechanics in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and pronated feet? METHODS: Twenty-eight adult males with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and pronated feet were divided into two equal groups (intervention and active control groups). Participants were asked to run at a constant speed of {$\sim$}3.2~m/s over an 18~m runway, respectively. Ground reaction forces were recorded using a Bertec force plate. Muscle activities were recorded using a surface bipolar electromyography system. RESULTS: In intervention group but not control group, post-hoc analysis demonstrated significantly longer time-to-peak of impact vertical ground reaction force at post-test than that pre-test (p~=~0.047). In intervention group but not control group, post-hoc analysis demonstrated significant decreases of semitendinosus activities during push-off at post-test compared with the pre-test (p~=~0.005). SIGNIFICANCE: Sand training improved time-to-peak of ground reaction forces (e.g., time-to-peak of peak of impact vertical ground reaction force) and muscle activities (e.g., semitendinosus activities) in adult males with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and pronated feet.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is crucial for safe return to play (RTP) and reducing the chances of a reinjury. Yet, there is no consensus on the ideal functional tests to assess rehabilitation progress in soccer players after ACLR. PURPOSE: The primary objective was to highlight the existing gap in the literature concerning the most effective standardized rehabilitation protocols and testing for facilitating successful RTP among soccer players. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A systematic review using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was conducted. Inclusion criteria encompassed original studies (level of evidence 1-4) that examined rehabilitation protocols, metrics of knee rehabilitation, and clinical outcomes after ACLR in soccer players. RESULTS: This review incorporated 23 studies, predominantly retrospective case series, with a total number of 874 soccer players who underwent ACLR and rehabiliation. 5 (21.7\%) studies utilized an accelerated rehabilitation protocol, while 7 (30.4\%) of studies utilized a criterion-based rehabilitation. A wide heterogeneity of data was extracted including functional tests of rehabilitation and RTP such as strength test batteries, hop test batteries, and movement quality assessments. Of the 23 selected studies, 2 (8.7\%) used all 3 test batteries, 8 (34.8\%) used 2 test batteries, 12 (52.2\%) used 1 test battery, and 1 (4.3\%) used 0 of the test batteries. The mean time between surgery and RTP ranged from 3 to 8 months with only 2 (8.7\%) studies reporting complications after ACLR. Lastly, out of the total studies examined, 9 (39.1\%) assessed patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), all of which demonstrated significant improvement from the initial assessment to the final follow up. CONCLUSION: Soccer-specific rehabilitation after ACLR lacks standardization. Even though many studies have assessed protocols for optimal RTP and reduced secondary ACL injuries, there is a gap in the literature regarding the most effective protocols and RTP testing. The methodology reported by Kyritsis et al could serve as a foundation for future prospective randomized multicenter studies to establish a standard rehabilitation protocol and enable a successful return to soccer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychological responses after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and ACL reconstruction (ACLR) have been identified as predictors of return to sport but have not been investigated in relation to further injury. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To determine whether psychological readiness to return to sport is associated with second ACL injury. It was hypothesized a priori that at both preoperative and 12-month postoperative time points, patients who sustained a second ACL injury would have lower psychological readiness than patients who did not have a second injury. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Patients who had a primary ACLR procedure between June 2014 and June 2016 completed the ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) (short version) scale before their ACLR and repeated the scale at 12 months after surgery to assess psychological readiness to return to sport. Patients were followed for a minimum of 2 years (range, 2-4 years) after surgery to determine further injury. The primary outcome was the relationship between ACL-RSI scores and the incidence of second ACL injury. RESULTS: In 329 patients who returned to sport after ACLR, 52 (16\%) sustained a second ACL injury. No difference in psychological readiness was observed at the preoperative time point, but patients who sustained a second injury trended toward lower psychological readiness at 12 months compared with noninjured patients (60.9 vs 67.2 points; P = .11). Younger ({$\leq$}20 years) patients with injury had significantly lower psychological readiness to return to sport than young noninjured patients (60.8 vs 71.5 points; P = .02), but no difference was found in older patients (60.9 vs 64.6 points; P = .58). In younger patients, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a cutoff score of 76.7 points with 90\% sensitivity to identify younger patients who sustained a second ACL injury. CONCLUSION: Younger patients with lower psychological readiness are at higher risk for a second ACL injury after return to sport.},

  abstract = {Multiligament knee injuries (MLKIs) are debilitating injuries that increasingly occur in young athletes. Return to sport (RTS) has historically been considered unlikely due to the severity of these injuries. Reporting in the literature regarding objective outcomes following MLKI, including RTS, is lacking, as are clear protocols for both rehabilitation progressions and RTS testing. RTS following MLKI is a complex process that requires an extended recovery duration compared to other surgery types. Progressions through postoperative rehabilitation and RTS should be thoughtful, gradual, and criterion based. After effective anatomic reconstruction to restore joint stability, objective measures of recovery including range of motion, strength, movement quality, power, and overall conditioning guide decision-making throughout the recovery process. It is important to frame the recovery process of the athlete in the context of the severity of their injury, as it is typically slower and less linear. Improved reporting on objective outcomes will enhance our understanding of recovery expectations within this population by highlighting persistent deficits that may interfere with a full recovery, including RTS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous individual, temporal, injury- and surgery-specific factors impact the functional capacity during rehabilitation, return to sports (RTS), and re-injury prevention after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. PURPOSE: This multicentre cohort study evaluated the isolated and interactive contributions of time between injury and surgery, time since reconstruction, age, gender, pain, graft type, and concomitant injuries as to inertial sensor-assessed motor function after ACL reconstructions in multiple linear mixed model regressions. METHODS: Anonymized data were retrieved from a nationwide German registry. In this cohort study, patients with an acute unilateral ACL rupture, with or without concomitant ipsilateral knee injuries, and having passed an arthroscopically assisted anatomic reconstruction were included. Potential predictors were age [years], gender/sex, time since reconstruction [days], time between injury and reconstruction [days], concomitant intra-articular injuries (isolated ACL tear, meniscal tear, lateral ligament, unhappy triad), graft type (hamstrings, patellar, or quadriceps tendon autograft), and pain during each measurement (visual analogue scale 0-10~cm). Repeated inertial motion unit-assessments of a comprehensive battery of classic functional RTS test were performed in the course of the rehabilitation and return to sports: Joint position sense/kinesthesia (Angle reproduction error [degrees]), Dynamic Balance Composite score [cm] of the Y-Balance test), drop jumps (Knee displacement [cm]), Vertical hop (Hopping height [mm]), Speedy jumps (Duration [seconds]), Side hops (Number of hops [n]), single leg hop for distance (hopping distance [cm]). Repeated measures multiple linear mixed models investigated the impact and nesting interaction of the potential predictors on the functional outcomes. RESULTS: Data from 1441 persons (mean age 29.4, SD 11.8~years; 592 female, 849 male) were included. Most had an isolated ACL rupture: n\,=\,938 (65.1\%). Minor shares showed lateral ligament involvement: n\,=\,70 (4.9\%), meniscal tear: n\,=\,414 (28.7\%), or even unhappy triad: n\,=\,15 (1\%). Several predictors such as time between injury and reconstruction, time since reconstruction (estimates for ndays ranged from\,+\,.05 (i.e., an increase of the hopping distance of 0.05~cm per day since reconstruction occurs) for single leg hop for distance to\,+\,0.17 for vertical hopping height; p\,{$<$}\,0.001), age, gender, pain, graft type (patellar tendon graft: estimates between\,+\,0.21 for Y-balance and\,+\,0.48 for vertical hop performance; p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and concomitant injuries contribute to the individual courses of functional abilities of the reconstructed side after ACL reconstruction. The unimpaired side was mostly influenced by sex, age, the time between injury and reconstruction (estimates between -\,0.0033 (side hops) and\,+\,0.10 (vertical hopping height), p\,{$<$}\,0.001)), and time since reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Time since reconstruction, time between injury and reconstruction, age, gender, pain, graft type, and concomitant injuries are not independent but nested interrelating predictors of functional outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. It might not be enough to assess them isolated; the knowledge on their interactive contribution to motor function is helpful for the management of the reconstruction (earlier reconstructions should be preferred) deficit-oriented function-based rehabilitation (time- and function based rehabilitation instead of solely a time- or function based approach) and individualized return to sports strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variables affecting return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are multifactorial. The nonphysical factors germane to successful return to play (RTP) are being increasingly recognized. PURPOSE: To (1) evaluate the available evidence base for psychological factors relating to RTP after ACLR, (2) identify psychological factors affecting RTP after ACLR, and (3) understand currently available metrics used to assess psychological RTP readiness. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A review of the MEDLINE database was performed for studies reporting RTP after ACLR. Studies reporting on the psychological determinants of RTP were included. Demographic, methodological, and psychometric properties of the included studies were extracted. Weighted analysis was performed after patients were pooled across included studies. RESULTS: Of 999 studies identified in the initial search, 28 (2.8\%) studies, comprising 2918 patients, were included; 19 studies (n = 2175 patients) reported RTP rates. The mean time for RTP was 17.2 months. There was a 63.4\% rate of RTP, and 36.6\% of patients returning to sport were not able to perform at their prior level of play. Of the 795 patients who did not achieve RTP, 514 (64.7\%) cited a psychological reason for not returning. Fear of reinjury was the most common reason (n = 394; 76.7\%); other psychological factors included lack of confidence in the treated knee (n = 76; 14.8\%), depression (n = 29; 5.6\%), and lack of interest/motivation (n = 13; 2.5\%). The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the ACL-Return to Sport after Injury scale, and the Knee Self-Efficacy Scale were reported measures for assessing the influence of psychology on RTP. CONCLUSION: Psychological factors play an important role in RTP after ACLR. Among studies evaluating the impact of psychology on RTP, there was a delay in returning as well as lower RTP rates compared with the previously reported normative literature. Fear of reinjury was the most commonly reported impediment to RTP. The psychosocial measures identified in this review may have a role in RTP protocols for assessing mental resiliency; however, their roles need to be further investigated and validated in patients who have undergone ACLR.},

The flexion-extension angle of the knee was recorded during a range of functional activities performed as part of a circuit in and around the hospital. The functions analysed including gait, walking on slopes, stair negotiation, the use of standard and low chairs and a bath. The data were used to produce the pattern of joint angulation against the percentage of the cycle for each individual conducting each activity. Further the maximum and minimum knee joint angles and the excursion of the joint during the cycle were identified. The results indicate gait and slopes require less than 90 degrees of knee flexion, stairs and chairs 90-120 degrees of flexion and a bath approximately 135 degrees of flexion. The data suggests that 110 degrees of flexion would seem a suitable goal for the rehabilitation of motion in the knee. It is concluded that flexible electrogoniometry is a suitable and practical method for evaluating knee motion during a range of functional activities.},

The main validated tool to quantify a patient's psychological readiness to return to sport after this surgery is the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale. PURPOSE: The primary aim was to analyze the progression of the ACL-RSI score from preoperatively to 2-year follow-up. A secondary goal was to identify the factors associated with returning to the same preinjury sport. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: This prospective study included athletes older than 16 years in all sports and levels of play who underwent primary and revision isolated ACL reconstruction from 2012 to 2015 and responded to all study questionnaires at 2-year follow-up. The primary outcome was the ACL-RSI score obtained preoperatively and at 4-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. The secondary outcomes were return to sport (running and the same preinjury sport) and various functional scores. The optimal threshold value of the ACL-RSI score for returning to the same preinjury sport was determined with the receiver operating characteristic curve. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify other factors associated with returning to the same sport at 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 681 patients were analyzed (467 men, 214 women; mean age, 30.2 {\textpm} 9.5 years); 298 (43.8\%) patients were professional or competitive athletes. The ACL-RSI score improved significantly over time: 41.3 {\textpm} 25.4 preoperatively, 55.1 {\textpm} 21.3 at 4 months, 58.3 {\textpm} 22.3 at 6 months, 64.7 {\textpm} 24.2 at 1 year, and 65.2 {\textpm} 25.3 at 2 years (P {$<$} .00001). At 2-year follow-up, 74.9\% of patients had returned to running and 58.4\% to their same preinjury sport. The ACL-RSI score was significantly higher in patients who had returned to sport and in those who returned to the same level of play or higher (P {$<$} .00001). The optimal ACL-RSI score threshold to return to the same sport at 2-year follow-up was {$\geq$}65. Multivariate analysis showed that the predictive factors of returning to the same preinjury sport at 2-year follow-up were primary reconstruction, professional or competitive level of play, an ACL-RSI score {$\geq$}60 at 6-month follow-up, and the absence of postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: The psychological ACL-RSI score improved regularly after ACL reconstruction and was strongly and significantly associated with return to sport.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The biomechanical behaviour of the knee following multiple-ligament reconstruction (MLKR) may play a role in the pathogenesis of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to compare three-dimensional knee kinematics and gait characteristics of MLKR patients to healthy controls during level walking. METHODS: Three-dimensional optoelectronic motion capture during overground walking was performed on 16 patients with MLKR and a group of healthy controls matched individually to each patient for age, gender, height and weight. Three-dimensional knee angles were extracted from the weight acceptance and propulsion sub-phases of gait. Statistical analysis was performed using group-aggregated data, as well as for each patient-control pair using a single-case approach. RESULTS: Although group analysis detected few differences, single-case analysis revealed significant differences for a proportion of patients for all dependent variables during weight acceptance and propulsion sub-phases of stance. These kinematic differences occurred in the context of reduced gait velocity, step length and cadence, as well as increased time spent in double support. CONCLUSION: Patients with MLKR display abnormalities in knee kinematics during gait at an average of 4.5~years after surgery. The pattern of kinematic abnormalities appears individual specific and may not be related to differences in spatiotemporal gait characteristics. The current findings describe detailed functional outcomes of MLKR reconstruction at average medium-term follow-up that provide improved prognostic information for clinicians to counsel patients with these types of injuries.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective pain management after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction improves patient satisfaction and function. PURPOSE: To collect and evaluate the available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on pain control after ACL reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, UpToDate, Cochrane Reviews, CINAHL, and Scopus following PRISMA guidelines (July 2014). Only RCTs comparing a method of postoperative pain control to another method or placebo were included. RESULTS: A total of 77 RCTs met inclusion criteria: 14 on regional nerve blocks, 21 on intra-articular injections, 4 on intramuscular/intravenous injections, 12 on multimodal regimens, 6 on oral medications, 10 on cryotherapy/compression, 6 on mobilization, and 5 on intraoperative techniques. Single-injection femoral nerve blocks provided superior analgesia to placebo for up to 24 hours postoperatively; however, this also resulted in a quadriceps motor deficit. Indwelling femoral catheters utilized for 2 days postoperatively provided superior analgesia to a single-injection femoral nerve block. Local anesthetic injections at the surgical wound site or intra-articularly provided equivalent analgesia to regional nerve blocks. Continuous-infusion catheters of a local anesthetic provided adequate pain relief but have been shown to cause chondrolysis. Cryotherapy improved analgesia compared to no cryotherapy in 4 trials, while in 4 trials, ice water and water at room temperature provided equivalent analgesic effects. Early weightbearing decreased pain compared to delayed weightbearing. Oral gabapentin given preoperatively and oral zolpidem given for the first week postoperatively each decreased opioid consumption as compared to placebo. Ibuprofen reduced pain compared to acetaminophen. Oral ketorolac reduced pain compared to hydrocodone-acetaminophen. CONCLUSION: Regional nerve blocks and intra-articular injections are both effective forms of analgesia. Cryotherapy-compression appears to be beneficial, provided that intra-articular temperatures are sufficiently decreased. Early mobilization reduces pain symptoms. Gabapentin, zolpidem, ketorolac, and ibuprofen decrease opioid consumption. Despite the vast amount of high-quality evidence on this topic, further research is needed to determine the optimal multimodal approach that can maximize recovery while minimizing pain and opioid consumption. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results provide the best available evidence from RCTs on pain control regimens after ACL reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Anterior cruciate ligament surgery and rehabilitation have changed drastically during the past 30 years. The patellar tendon autograft fixed with buttons provides tight bone-to-bone placement of the graft and quick bony healing, which allows accelerated rehabilitation to obtain full range of motion and strength. Although surgical stability is easily reproducible, long-term patient satisfaction is difficult to guarantee. Full knee range of motion should be compared to that of the contralateral normal knee, including full hyperextension. We followed the progress of all patients to gauge the utility of our rehabilitation program. In order of importance, the lack of normal knee range of motion (within 2 degrees extension and 5 degrees of flexion compared with that of the normal knee), partial or total medial meniscectomy, partial or total lateral meniscectomy, and articular cartilage damage were related to lower subjective scores. Rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction must first strive to achieve full symmetrical knee range of motion before aggressive strengthening can begin. Our current perioperative rehabilitation starts at the time of injury and preoperatively includes aggressive swelling reduction, hyperextension exercises, gait training, and mental preparation. Goals after surgery are to control swelling while regaining full knee range of motion. After quadriceps strengthening goals are reached, patients can shift to sport-specific exercises. When using a graft from the contralateral knee, the conflicting goals of strengthening the donor site and achieving full knee range of motion are divided between the knees. Thus, normal range of motion and strength can be achieved more easily and more quickly than when using an ipsilateral graft. Regardless of the graft source, a systematic rehabilitation program that emphasizes the return to symmetrical knee motion, including hyperextension, is necessary to achieve the optimum result.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychological readiness to return to sports (RTS) has been associated with second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, this relationship is controversial because covariates such as anatomic and knee function characteristics have not been adequately considered. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To investigate whether psychological readiness in the early postoperative period can predict the occurrence of a second ACL injury within 24 months after primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) using propensity score analysis. It was hypothesized that patients with high ACL-RSI after injury (ACL-RSI) scores at 3 months postoperatively would have a second ACL injury within the projected postoperative period. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Included were 169 patients who underwent primary ACLR using hamstring tendon autografts between November 2017 and July 2021 and also underwent knee functional assessments at 3 months postoperatively. The ACL-RSI scale was used to assess psychological readiness for RTS. A second ACL injury was defined if ipsilateral or contralateral ACL injury was confirmed by examination within 24 months postoperatively. Based on a previous study showing that 65 was the highest cutoff value for the ACL-RSI score for RTS, we classified patients into 2 groups: those with high ACL-RSI scores ({$\geq$}65; group H) and those with low ACL-RSI scores ({$<$}65; group L). We generated 1-to-1 matched pairs using propensity score analysis and used log-rank testing to compare the rate of second ACL injury between the 2 groups. RESULTS: More patients returned to any sports activities within 12 months in group H than in group L (90\% vs 73\%; P = .03). A second ACL injury within 24 months postoperatively was identified in 7\% of patients (13/169). The rate of second ACL injury was significantly higher in group H than in group L (17.6\% vs 3.4\%; P = .001). In 43 matched pairs extracted using propensity scoring, the rate of second ACL injury was also higher in group H than in group L (18.6\% vs 4.7\%; P = .04). CONCLUSION: Patients with a higher ACL-RSI score at 3 months exhibited a significantly higher incidence of second ACL injury within 24 months after primary ACLR.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the test-retest reliability of the 4-meter walk test (4 MWT) and 10-meter walk test (10 MWT) in patients undergoing lower extremity surgery during inpatient rehabilitation. METHOD: In all, 102 patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), lower extremity fracture (LEF) and soft tissue operation were recruited. Patients performed two 4 MWT and two 10 MWT trials on the same day. The same researcher performed all the measurements to avoid inter-rater variability. RESULTS: The 4 MWT and 10 MWT were shown to have excellent test-retest reliability. The ICCs for the 4 MWT and 10 MWT were found as 0.94 and 0.95, respectively. The SEMs for the 4 MWT and 10 MWT were 2.0 and 5.5\,seconds, respectively. The smallest real difference at the 95\% confidence level (SRD95) was 5.5\,seconds for the 4 MWT and 12.2\,seconds for 10 MWT and SRD95 percentage was 31.2 for the 4 MWT and 28.5 for the 10 MWT. CONCLUSION: Both the 4 MWT and the 10 MWT have excellent reliability in patients undergoing lower extremity surgery such as TKA, THA, LEF and soft tissue operation during inpatient rehabilitation. Clinicians and researchers can be confident that changes above the SRD95s for the different patient groups, for both sexes and with regard to weight-bearing status, represent a real clinical change in rehabilitation process. Implications for Rehabilitation The 4 MWT and the 10 MWT are simple methods and were also shown to be reliable measurement methods in many patient groups. This study illustrates that the test-retest reliability of the 4 MWT and 10 MWT are excellent in patients undergoing lower extremity surgery during inpatient rehabilitation (ICC: 0.94 for 4 MWT, ICC: 0.95 for 10 MWT). Clinicians and researchers can be confident that changes above the SRD95s for the different patient groups, for both sexes and with regard to weight-bearing status represent a real clinical change in rehabilitation process.},

  abstract = {While cryotherapy has been shown to decrease postoperative pain after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, less is known of the effects of combined cryotherapy and compression. The goal of this study was to compare subjective and objective patient outcomes following ACL reconstruction with combined compression and cryotherapy compared with traditional ice therapy alone. Patients undergoing ACL reconstruction were randomized to cryotherapy/compression device (group 1) or a standardized ice pack (group 2). Both groups were instructed to use the ice or cryotherapy/compression device three times per day and return to the clinic at 1, 2, and 6 weeks postoperatively. Patient-derived outcome measurements used in this study consisted of the visual analog scale (VAS), the Lysholm knee score, Short Form-36 (SF-36), and single assessment numerical evaluation (SANE). Circumferential measurements of the knee at three locations (1 cm proximal to patella, mid-patella, and 1 cm distal to patella) were also obtained as a measure of postoperative edema. Narcotic medication use was recorded by questionnaire. The primary outcome measure (VAS) was significantly different among groups in the preoperative measurement, despite similarities in group demographics. Baseline VAS for group 1 was 54.9 compared with group 2 at 35.6 (p = 0.01). By 6 weeks, this had lowered to 28.1 and 40.3, respectively, resulting in a significant 27-point decrease in mean VAS for group 1 (p {$<$} 0.0001). However, the small increase in VAS for group 2 was not significant (p = 0.34). No significant differences were noted for the Lysholm, SF-36, or SANE scores either between groups or time points. Furthermore, no significant differences were noted for any of the circumferential measurements either between groups or time points. Of all patients, 83\% of group 1 discontinued narcotic use by 6 weeks, compared with only 28\% of group 2 (p = 0.0008). The use of combined cryotherapy and compression in the postoperative period after ACL reconstruction results in improved, short-term pain relief and a greater likelihood of independence from narcotic use compared with cryotherapy alone.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of meniscal injuries at the time of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) can result in restrictions on weightbearing and range of motion in the early rehabilitative phases. What is unknown is the effect of (1) meniscal tear type and location at the time of anterior cruciate ligament injury and (2) meniscal treatment at the time of ACLR on quadriceps strength in adolescents during the late rehabilitative phase. HYPOTHESIS: Meniscal tears involving the root and requiring repair would adversely affect quadriceps strength at 6 to 9 months postoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Patients who underwent ACLR at 1 of 2 research sites between 2013 and 2021 were identified. Adolescent participants were included if they were between the ages of 12 and 20 years at the time of assessment and had undergone primary unilateral ACLR in the previous 6 to 9 months. Participants were subgrouped by meniscal tear type (no tear, nonroot tear, root tear) and meniscal treatment at the time of ACLR (no treatment, meniscectomy, meniscal repair), which were confirmed via chart review. Isokinetic strength testing occurred at 60 deg/s, and quadriceps strength and quadriceps strength limb symmetry index were compared between the meniscal tear type and meniscal procedure subgroups using analysis of covariance while controlling for the effects of age, sex, and ACLR graft source. RESULTS: An overall 236 patients were included in this analysis (109 male, 127 female; mean {\textpm} SD age, 16.0 {\textpm} 1.9 years). There were no significant differences in ACLR limb quadriceps strength based on meniscal tear type (P = .61) or meniscal procedure at the time of ACLR (P = .61), after controlling for age, biological sex, and ACLR graft source. Similarly, quadriceps strength limb symmetry index did not differ by meniscal tear type (P = .38) or meniscal procedure at the time of ACLR (P = .40). CONCLUSION: Meniscal tear type and treatment at the time of ACLR did not affect quadriceps strength or quadriceps strength symmetry in adolescents 6 to 9 months after ACLR.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scale is a reliable and valid tool for evaluation of psychological readiness to return to sport after ACL injury, but its responsiveness to change has not been extensively evaluated. PURPOSE: To determine the responsiveness of the ACL-RSI scale. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: The ACL-RSI scale and the knee confidence question from the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Quality of Life subscale was completed at 6 and 12 months after ACL reconstruction surgery. Responsiveness was assessed using distribution and anchor-based methods for the full- and short-form versions of the scale and subgroup analyzed for sex. From distribution statistics, the standardized response mean (SRM) and the smallest detectable change (SDC) were calculated. Using the anchor-based method, the minimally important change (MIC) that was associated with an improvement in knee confidence was determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 441 patients (257 men, 184 women; mean age of 25 years) were included in this study. An SRM of 0.7 was found for both versions, indicating a moderate level of responsiveness. The MIC was 13.4 points for the full-form version and 15.1 points for the short-form version. These values were larger than SDC values at the group level but not at the individual patient level. Responsiveness was similar between male and female patients. CONCLUSION: The ACL-RSI scale had sufficient responsiveness to investigate the efficacy of an intervention at a group level, but it may be more limited at an individual patient level.},

With advances in surgical techniques providing better positioning and fixation of the graft, subsequent graft failure to certain extent should be accounted by poor graft healing. Although different biological modulations for enhancement of graft healing have been tried in different clinical and animal studies, complete graft incorporation into bone tunnels and the "ligamentization" of the intra-articular part have not been fully achieved yet. Based on the understanding of graft healing process and its failure mechanism, the purpose of this review is to combine both the known basic science \& clinical evidence, to provide a much clearer picture of the obstacle encountered in graft healing, so as to facilitate researchers on subsequent work on the enhancement of ACL graft healing.},
