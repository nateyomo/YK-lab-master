  abstract = {Iron and copper have similar physiochemical properties; thus, physiologically relevant interactions seem likely. Indeed, points of intersection between these two essential trace minerals have been recognized for many decades, but mechanistic details have been lacking. Investigations in recent years have revealed that copper may positively influence iron homeostasis, and also that iron may antagonize copper metabolism. For example, when body iron stores are low, copper is apparently redistributed to tissues important for regulating iron balance, including enterocytes of upper small bowel, the liver, and blood. Copper in enterocytes may positively influence iron transport, and hepatic copper may enhance biosynthesis of a circulating ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin, which potentiates iron release from stores. Moreover, many intestinal genes related to iron absorption are transactivated by a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-2{$\alpha$} (HIF2{$\alpha$}), during iron deficiency. Interestingly, copper influences the DNA-binding activity of the HIF factors, thus further exemplifying how copper may modulate intestinal iron homeostasis. Copper may also alter the activity of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin. Furthermore, copper depletion has been noted in iron-loading disorders, such as hereditary hemochromatosis. Copper depletion may also be caused by high-dose iron supplementation, raising concerns particularly in pregnancy when iron supplementation is widely recommended. This review will cover the basic physiology of intestinal iron and copper absorption as well as the metabolism of these minerals in the liver. Also considered in detail will be current experimental work in this field, with a focus on molecular aspects of intestinal and hepatic iron-copper interplay and how this relates to various disease states. {\copyright} 2018 American Physiological Society.

  abstract = {Multi-copper oxidases (MCOs) are a small group of enzymes that oxidize their substrate with the concomitant reduction of dioxygen to two water molecules. Generally, multi-copper oxidases are promiscuous with regards to their reducing substrates and are capable of performing various functions in different species. To date, three multi-copper oxidases have been detected in humans--ceruloplasmin, hephaestin and zyklopen. Each of these enzymes has a high specificity towards iron with the resulting ferroxidase activity being associated with ferroportin, the only known iron exporter protein in humans. Ferroportin exports iron as Fe(2+), but transferrin, the major iron transporter protein of blood, can bind only Fe(3+) effectively. Iron oxidation in enterocytes is mediated mainly by hephaestin thus allowing dietary iron to enter the bloodstream. Zyklopen is involved in iron efflux from placental trophoblasts during iron transfer from mother to fetus. Release of iron from the liver relies on ferroportin and the ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin which is found in blood in a soluble form. Ceruloplasmin, hephaestin and zyklopen show distinctive expression patterns and have unique mechanisms for regulating their expression. These features of human multi-copper ferroxidases can serve as a basis for the precise control of iron efflux in different tissues. In this manuscript, we review the biochemical and biological properties of the three human MCOs and discuss their potential roles in human iron homeostasis.},
