  abstract = {Orthostatic hypotension is a chronic, debilitating illness that is difficult to treat. The therapeutic goal is to improve postural symptoms, standing time, and function rather than to achieve upright normotension, which can lead to supine hypertension. Drug therapy alone is never adequate. Because orthostatic stress varies with circumstances during the day, a patient-oriented approach that emphasizes education and nonpharmacologic strategies is critical. We provide easy-to-remember management recommendations, using a combination of drug and nondrug treatments that have proven efficacious.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review the evidence base for the effectiveness and safety of caffeine for the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in adults. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were searched in January 2021. Original research studies or case reports involving adults with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension were included if caffeine was an intervention and outcomes included symptoms, blood pressure or adverse effects. Relevant studies were screened and underwent qualitative analysis. Insufficient reporting precluded meta-analysis. RESULTS: Five studies were identified: four crossover studies and one case report summation. Study size ranged from 5 to 16 participants. Participants had neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, with a mean standing systolic blood pressure of 86~mmHg. Two studies evaluated caffeine alone. Three studies administered caffeine in combination with ergotamine. Caffeine dose ranged from 100 to 300~mg. Nature and timing of outcomes measured varied between studies, with measurements being recorded from 30 to 480~min after intervention. Caffeine/ergotamine improved symptoms in one study and reduced orthostatic blood pressure drop in two studies. Caffeine/ergotamine increased seated blood pressure in three studies, whilst the results for caffeine alone were inconsistent. No serious adverse events were reported. All studies demonstrated high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Caffeine should only be considered as a treatment for adults with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension when evidence-based treatments have been exhausted.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Posture-related vasovagal syncope is by far the most frequent cause of transient loss of consciousness, and present pharmacological and cardiac pacing treatment remains unsatisfactory. A simple maneuver to prevent or diminish vasovagal reactions would be beneficial. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with recurrent syncope (age 17 to 74 years, 11 males) who were referred for routine tilt-table testing and had a positive test were included. They were instructed to perform leg crossing and muscle tensing for at least 30 seconds at the onset of a tilt table-provoked impending faint. Continuously measured blood pressure and heart rate at nadir and during the maneuver were compared. Ten months after the test, a telephone follow-up was performed. The physical counter-maneuver, performed in 20 of 21 subjects, increased blood pressure and heart rate. Systolic blood pressure rose from 65+/-13 to 106+/-16 mm Hg (mean+/-SD, P{$<$}0.001), and diastolic blood pressure rose from 43+/-9 to 65+/-10 mm Hg (P{$<$}0.001). During the maneuver, prodromal symptoms disappeared in all patients, and none lost consciousness. After terminating the maneuver, symptoms did not return in 5 subjects during the test. At follow-up, 13 of 20 patients reported that they applied the maneuver in daily life and benefited from it. CONCLUSIONS: Leg crossing combined with tensing muscles at the onset of prodromal symptoms can postpone and in some subjects prevent vasovagal syncope.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature on nonpharmacologic treatment of orthostatic hypotension. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SPORTDiscus were searched for human studies written in the English language between January 1980 and April 2013. Reference lists of relevant articles were reviewed for citations to expand the data set. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective experimental studies assessing nonpharmacologic interventions for management of orthostatic drop in blood pressure in various patient populations were included. All studies identified through the literature search were reviewed independently in duplicate. Of the 642 studies, 23 met the selection criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted data for analysis, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and orthostatic symptoms in response to postural challenge before and after the intervention. All 23 studies were assessed in duplicate for risk of bias using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for randomized controlled trials and the Downs and Black tool for nonrandomized trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: There were 8 identified nonpharmacologic interventions for management of orthostatic hypotension under 2 general categories: physical modalities (exercise, functional electrical stimulation, compression, physical countermaneuvers, compression with physical countermaneuvers, sleeping with head up) and dietary measures (water intake, meals). Owing to the clinically diverse nature of the studies, statistical comparison (meta-analysis) was deemed inappropriate. Instead, descriptive comparisons were drawn. Levels of evidence were assigned. CONCLUSIONS: Strong levels of evidence were found for 4 of the 8 interventions: functional electrical stimulation in spinal cord injury, compression of the legs and/or abdomen, physical countermaneuvers in various patient populations, and eating smaller and more frequent meals in chronic autonomic failure. However, this conclusion is based on a limited number of studies with small sample sizes. Further research into all interventions is warranted.},
