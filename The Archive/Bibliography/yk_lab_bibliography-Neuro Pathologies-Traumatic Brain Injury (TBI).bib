  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe cross-sectional relationships between postconcussion symptom catastrophizing and patient-level factors in a postconcussion cohort. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted in an outpatient rehabilitation hospital concussion clinic and consisted of adults undergoing a neuropsychological evaluation. Cronbach {$\alpha$} assessed internal consistency for Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores. Pearson r correlation coefficients assessed construct validity among emotional function measures and Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores at initial evaluation. Hierarchical regression models were used to assess criterion validity. RESULTS: Excellent internal consistency was observed for Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores ({$\alpha$} = 0.953). The Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale was significantly correlated with cause of injury ( r = -0.223, P {$<$} 0.01), litigation consideration ( r = 0.309, P {$<$} 0.05), and history of psychiatric illness ( r = 0.198, P {$<$} 0.01). The Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale was significantly correlated with emotional functioning (Patient Health Questionnaire [ r = 0.600, P {$<$} 0.05]; Generalized Anxiety Disorder [ r = 0.602, P {$<$} 0.05]), symptom rating (Sports Concussion Assessment Tool [Fifth Edition, r = 0.477, P {$<$} 0.05]), and cognitive functioning (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status [ r = -0.238, P {$<$} 0.05]) measures. The final regression model explained 64.7\% variance in Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores and included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( b = 1.038, {$\beta$} = 0.466, P = 0.001) as a unique predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate strong, positive relationships between anxiety and catastrophizing at initial neuropsychological evaluation in a postconcussion sample.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a neurological disorder which represents a major health issue worldwide. It causes mortality and disability among all group ages, caused by external force, sports-related events or violence and road traffic accidents. In the USA, approximately one-third people die annually due to injury and 1.7 million people suffer from traumatic brain injury. Every year in India around 1.6 million individuals suffer from sustain brain injury with 200,000 deaths and approximately one million person needed recovery treatment at any stage of time. Sports-related head impact and trauma has become an extremely controversial public health and medico-legal problem that accounts for 20\% of all brain injury (including concussion). It is difficult to reverse the primary injury but the secondary injury can be minimized by using proper pharmacological intervention during the initial hours of injury. This article highlights the pathophysiology and types of TBI along with treatment therapies. Till date, there is no single medication that can decrease the progression of the disease so that symptomatic treatment is given to the patient by determining proper pathology. Recently various herbal medicine therapies and traditional supplements have been developed for TBI. Nutritional supplementation and nutraceuticals have exposed potential in the treatment of TBI when used before and after TBI. The compiled data will enable the readers to know the pathophysiology as well as the allopathic and natural remedies to treat the TBI.},

I investigated the efficacy of standardized mental status testing on the sport sideline to detect abnormalities that result from concussion and provide an objective measure of postinjury cognitive recovery. DESIGN AND SETTING: All subjects underwent a standardized preseason baseline mental status evaluation. Standardized testing of injured and uninjured control subjects was repeated on the sideline immediately after concussion and 48 hours after injury. SUBJECTS: Sixty-three high school and collegiate football players with concussion and 55 uninjured control subjects were studied. MEASUREMENTS: The Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) was administered to evaluate neurocognitive functioning and neurologic status. RESULTS: Immediately after concussion, injured subjects performed significantly below preinjury baseline and below uninjured controls on the SAC. Measurable deficits in orientation, concentration, and memory were evident immediately after concussion. A decline in SAC score at time of injury was 95\% sensitive and 76\% specific in accurately classifying injured and uninjured subjects on the sideline. Injured subjects demonstrated significant improvements in SAC score 48 hours after injury. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized mental status testing can be a valuable tool to assist the sports medicine clinician in detecting the immediate effects of concussion on mental status, tracking resolution of immediate postconcussive mental status abnormalities, and making more informed decisions on return to play after injury.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Individuals with persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) may present with a myriad of physical symptoms. There is limited research available comparing the presence of examination findings among individuals with PPCS from different age groups. METHODS: Retrospective case-control chart review of 481 patients with PPCS and 271 non-trauma controls. Physical assessments were categorized as ocular, cervical, and vestibular/balance. Differences in presentation were compared between PPCS and controls as well as between individuals with PPCS in three age groups: adolescents, young adults, and older adults. RESULTS: All three PPCS groups had more abnormal oculomotor findings than their age-matched counterparts. When comparing PPCS patients from different age groups, no differences were seen in prevalence of abnormal smooth pursuits or saccades; however, adolescents with PPCS had more abnormal cervical findings and a lower prevalence of abnormal NPC, vestibular and balance findings. CONCLUSION: Patients with PPCS presented with a different constellation of clinical findings based on their age. Adolescents were more likely to demonstrate evidence of cervical injury compared to younger and older adults, and adults were more likely to present with vestibular findings and impaired NPC. Adults with PPCS were more likely to present with abnormal oculomotor findings compared to adults with non-traumatic causes of dizziness.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs in patients of all age groups and is a significant public health issue. In the United States, 1.5 million TBIs occur annually, 75\% of TBIs are classified as mild, and costs~are generated of \$17 billion each year. Most patients that suffer from TBI will have spontaneous resolution of symptoms, but for some patients, symptoms may linger and negatively affect daily cognitive function. Post-concussive syndrome (PCS) demarcates the constellation of symptoms seen most often in~prolonged~mild TBI, however, it may also occur following moderate and severe TBI. Clinical criteria for PCS are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). PCS is a constellation of physical, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional symptoms occurring after TBI. These symptoms include a headache, fatigue, vision changes, disturbances in balance, confusion, dizziness, insomnia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and difficulty with concentration.~Approximately 90\% of concussion symptoms are transient, with symptoms resolving within 10 to 14 days but may linger for weeks. Persistent PCS occurs when symptoms persist past 3 months. Fifteen percent of mild TBI patients will suffer from PCS, and a small minority of those patients will experience persistent PCS requiring further evaluation and treatment. Research has shown that mild TBI resulting in persistent PCS has lasting effects on cognition, memory, learning, and executive function. Patients who suffer more than one~brain injury are at increased risk for PCS. Due to limited diagnostic tools, those permanent changes in executive function can go undocumented. Thus, the 15\% incidence of PCS is an underestimation of the true incidence.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Persistent ({$>$}4 weeks) postconcussion symptoms (PPCS) are challenging for both patients and clinicians. There is uncertainty about the effect of commonly applied nonpharmacological treatments for the management of PPCS. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess and summarize evidence for outcomes related to 7 nonpharmacological interventions for PPCS in adults (aged {$>$}18 years) and provide recommendations for clinical practice. DATA SOURCES: Systematic literature searches were performed via Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PEDro, OTseeker, and Cochrane Reviews (via MEDLINE and Embase) from earliest possible publication year to March 3, 2020. The literature was searched for prior systematic reviews and primary studies. To be included, studies had to be intervention studies with a control group and focus on PPCS. STUDY SELECTION: A multidisciplinary guideline panel selected interventions based on frequency of use and need for decision support among clinicians, including early information and advice, graded physical exercise, vestibular rehabilitation, manual treatment of neck and back, oculomotor vision treatment, psychological treatment, and interdisciplinary coordinated rehabilitative treatment. To be included, studies had to be intervention studies within the areas of the predefined clinical questions, include a control group, and focus on symptoms after concussion or mild traumatic brain injury. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Extraction was performed independently by multiple observers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for data abstraction and data quality assessment. Included studies were assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the Cochrane Risk of Bias (randomized clinical trials) tool. Meta-analysis was performed for all interventions where possible. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled estimates of effects. The level and certainty of evidence was rated and recommendations formulated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All outcomes were planned before data collection began according to a specified protocol. The primary outcomes were the collective burden of PPCS and another outcome reflecting the focus of a particular intervention (eg, physical functioning after graded exercise intervention). RESULTS: Eleven systematic reviews were identified but did not contribute any primary studies; 19 randomized clinical trials comprising 2007 participants (1064 women [53.0\%]) were separately identified and included. Evidence for the 7 interventions ranged from no evidence meeting the inclusion criteria to very low and low levels of evidence. Recommendations were weak for early information and advice, graded physical exercise, vestibular rehabilitation, manual treatment of the neck and back, psychological treatment, and interdisciplinary coordinated rehabilitative treatment. No relevant evidence was identified for oculomotor vision treatment, so the panel provided a good clinical practice recommendation based on consensus. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on very low to low certainty of evidence or based on consensus, the guideline panel found weak scientific support for commonly applied nonpharmacological interventions to treat PPCS. Results align with recommendations in international guidelines. Intensified research into all types of intervention for PPCS is needed.},

Mild TBI, which is typically defined by Glasgow Coma Scale score {$\geq$}13, accounts for the vast majority of all TBIs, particularly in the setting of sports-related injuries. The terms concussion and TBI are often used interchangeably, both in the medical literature and in clinical care of this patient population. However, the lack of clearly defined definitions of these terms often leads to confusion, and this confusion may lead to delayed diagnosis and inconsistent management of affected patients. Here, we review the current terminology and classification of mild TBI and concussion.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               The objective of this study was to determine the demographics and predictors of postconcussion syndrome (PCS) in a large series of patients using a novel definition of PCS.                                         METHODS               The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of 284 consecutive concussed patients, 221 of whom had PCS on the basis of at least 3 symptoms persisting at least 1 month. This definition of PCS was uniformly employed and is unique in accepting an expanded list of symptoms, in shortening the postconcussion interval to 1 month from 3 months, and in excluding those with focal injuries such as hemorrhages and contusions.                                         RESULTS                                The 221 cases showed considerable heterogeneity in clinical features of PCS. They averaged 3.3 concussions, with a range of 0 to 12 or more concussions, and 62.4\% occurred during sports and recreation. The median duration of PCS was 7 months at the time of examination, with 11.8\% lasting more than 2 years, and 23.1\% with PCS had only 1 concussion. The average patient age was 27 years (range 10--74 years). The average number of persistent symptoms was 8.1; 26.2\% had a previous psychiatric condition, attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, a learning disability, or previous migraine headaches. The prevalence of arachnoid cysts and Chiari malformation in PCS exceeded the general population. Additionally, involvement in litigation, presence of extracranial injuries, amnesia and/or loss of consciousness, and female sex were predictive of reporting a high number of symptoms. A prior history of psychiatric conditions or migraines, cause of injury, number of previous concussions, and age did not significantly predict symptom number. Only the number of symptoms reported predicted the duration of PCS. To predict the number of symptoms for those who fulfilled PCS criteria according to the                 International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision                 (ICD-10), and the                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition                 (DSM-IV), the number of previous concussions was significant.                                                        CONCLUSIONS               PCS is commonly associated with multiple concussions, but 23.1\% in the present series occurred after only 1 concussion. Most patients with PCS had multiple symptoms persisting for months or years. The median duration of PCS was 7 months, with a range up to 26 years. In only 11.3\%, the PCS had ended at the time of consultation. Not all predictors commonly cited in the literature align with the findings in this study. This is likely due to differences in the definitions of PCS used in research. These results suggest that the use of ICD-10 and DSM-IV to diagnose PCS may be biased toward those who are vulnerable to concussions or with more severe forms of PCS. It is thus important to redefine PCS based on evidence-based medicine.},
