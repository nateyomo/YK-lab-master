  abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most debilitating problems for humans. About 6 months after the initial injury, a cascade of secondary cellular and molecular events occurs and the primary damage enters the chronic phase. Current treatments are not curative. One of the new treatment methods is the use of cell therapy, which is gradually being tested in clinical trials to improve the symptoms of SCI patients. In this review article, we investigated the effect of different cell therapy trials in improving patients' symptoms and their paraclinical indicators. In the 72 final reviewed studies with 1144 cases and 186 controls, 20 scores were recorded as outcomes. We categorized the scores into seven groups. In upper extremity motor score, daily living function, trunk stability, postural hypotension, somatosensory evoked potential, and motor evoked potential scores, the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell therapy had a more healing effect. In the International Association of Neurorestoratology SCI Functional Rating Scale, light touch score, bowel function, decreased spasticity, Visual Analog Scale, and electromyography scores, the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell had more impact. The olfactory ensheathing cell had a greater effect on lower extremity motor score and pinprick scores than other cells. The embryonic stem cell had the greatest effect in improving the important score of the American Spinal Injury Association scale. Based on the obtained results, it seems that a special cell should be used to improve each symptom of patients with chronic SCI, and if the improvement of several harms is involved, the combination of cells may be effective.},

  abstract = {Older adults' difficulties in performing two tasks concurrently have been well documented (Kramer \& Madden, 2008). It has been observed that the age-related differences in dual-task performance are larger when the two tasks require similar motor responses (2001) and that in some conditions older adults also show greater susceptibility than younger adults to input interference (Hein \& Schubert, 2004). The authors recently observed that even when the two tasks require motor responses, both older and younger adults can learn to perform a visual discrimination task and an auditory discrimination task faster and more accurately (Bherer et al., 2005). In the present study, the authors extended this finding to a dual-task condition that involves two visual tasks requiring two motor responses. Older and younger adults completed a dual-task training program in which continuous individualized adaptive feedback was provided to enhance performance. The results indicate that, even with similar motor responses and two visual stimuli, both older and younger adults showed substantial gains in performance after training and that the improvement generalized to new task combinations involving new stimuli. These results suggest that dual-task skills can be substantially improved in older adults and that cognitive plasticity in attentional control is still possible in old age.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Emerging research is revealing that direct physical contact of the human body with the surface of the earth (grounding or earthing) has intriguing effects on human physiology and health, including beneficial effects on various cardiovascular risk factors. This study examined effects of 2 hours of grounding on the electrical charge (zeta potential) on red blood cells (RBCs) and the effects on the extent of RBC clumping. DESIGN/INTERVENTIONS: SUBJECTS were grounded with conductive patches on the soles of their feet and palms of their hands. Wires connected the patches to a stainless-steel rod inserted in the earth outdoors. Small fingertip pinprick blood samples were placed on microscope slides and an electric field was applied to them. Electrophoretic mobility of the RBCs was determined by measuring terminal velocities of the cells in video recordings taken through a microscope. RBC aggregation was measured by counting the numbers of clustered cells in each sample. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Each subject sat in a comfortable reclining chair in a soundproof experiment room with the lights dimmed or off. SUBJECTS: Ten (10) healthy adult subjects were recruited by word-of-mouth. RESULTS: Earthing or grounding increased zeta potentials in all samples by an average of 2.70 and significantly reduced RBC aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: Grounding increases the surface charge on RBCs and thereby reduces blood viscosity and clumping. Grounding appears to be one of the simplest and yet most profound interventions for helping reduce cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular events.},

However, emerging scientific research has revealed a surprisingly positive and overlooked environmental factor on health: direct physical contact with the vast supply of electrons on the surface of the Earth. Modern lifestyle separates humans from such contact. The research suggests that this disconnect may be a major contributor to physiological dysfunction and unwellness. Reconnection with the Earth's electrons has been found to promote intriguing physiological changes and subjective reports of well-being. Earthing (or grounding) refers to the discovery of benefits-including better sleep and reduced pain-from walking barefoot outside or sitting, working, or sleeping indoors connected to conductive systems that transfer the Earth's electrons from the ground into the body. This paper reviews the earthing research and the potential of earthing as a simple and easily accessed global modality of significant clinical importance.},

PURPOSE: To determine the effects of grounding on massage therapists' quality of life and pain. Grounding, refers to being in direct body contact with the ground, such as walking barefoot on humid soil or on grass. SETTING: The Chopra Center for Well-Being in Carlsbad, California, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen massage therapists (mean age 42.8 years). RESEARCH DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: A stepped wedge cluster design was incorporated into a 6-week double-blind Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) procedure with massage therapists assigned randomly into one of two cohorts. Therapists were not grounded for the first week, were grounded while working on clients and at home while sleeping for the next four weeks, and then ungrounded for the last week. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prior to, during, and immediately following the intervention, participants completed standardized questionnaires reporting on pain, physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue/tiredness, sleep disturbance and number of hours of sleep, number of clients worked on per working day, energy, and emotional and mental stress. RESULTS: As a group, therapists experienced significant increases in physical function and energy and significant decreases in fatigue, depressed mood, tiredness and pain while grounded as compared to not being grounded. At one-month following the study, physical function was also increased and depressed mood and fatigue were decreased. CONCLUSIONS: We observed consistent beneficial effects of grounding in domains highly relevant to massage therapists, namely pain, physical function, and mood. These findings, combined with prior results from this trial indicating improvements in inflammatory biomarkers, blood viscosity and heart rate variability (HRV), suggest that grounding is beneficial to massage therapists in multiple domains relevant to their occupation, supporting overall health and quality of life.},

Outcome measures: Pain, pigmentation, pliability, pruritus, surface area, scar thickness. Results: The overall results revealed that physical scar management is beneficial compared with the control treatment regarding the management of pain (p\,=\,0.012), pruritus (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), pigmentation (p\,=\,0.010), pliability (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), surface area (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and thickness (p\,=\,0.022) of scar tissue in adults. The observed risk of bias was high for blinding of participants and personnel (47\%) and low for other bias (100\%). Conclusions: Physical scar management demonstrates moderate-to-strong effects on improvement of scar issues as related to signs and symptoms. These results show the importance of specific physical management of scar tissue.},

However, they have been attacked as a category, incorrectly assuming there is a generic version that applies to all. We identify and respond to 5 main lines of argument made by such critics. We agree that some of these arguments have force against some of the theories in the literature but believe them to be overstated. We argue that the dual-processing distinction is supported by much recent evidence in cognitive science. Our preferred theoretical approach is one in which rapid autonomous processes (Type 1) are assumed to yield default responses unless intervened on by distinctive higher order reasoning processes (Type 2). What defines the difference is that Type 2 processing supports hypothetical thinking and load heavily on working memory.},

METHOD: We conducted a systematic review on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with meta-analyses using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method for random-effects models. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Outcomes included pain, depression, quality of life, and analgesic use. RESULTS: Thirty-eight RCTs met inclusion criteria; seven reported on safety. We found low-quality evidence that mindfulness meditation is associated with a small decrease in pain compared with all types of controls in 30 RCTs. Statistically significant effects were also found for depression symptoms and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: While mindfulness meditation improves pain and depression symptoms and quality of life, additional well-designed, rigorous, and large-scale RCTs are needed to decisively provide estimates of the efficacy of mindfulness meditation for chronic pain.},

Methods               Participants in the 2015 161-km Western States Endurance Run were randomized to a 20-minute postrace intervention of massage, intermittent sequential pneumatic compression, or supine rest. Each subject completed two 400-m runs at maximum speed before the race and on days 3 and 5 after the race, and also provided muscle pain and soreness ratings and overall muscular fatigue scores before and for 7 days after the race.                                         Results               Among the 72 runners who finished the race and completed the study, comparison among intervention groups revealed no significant group or interaction effect on 400-m run time, but there was a significant (P{$<$}.0001) time effect. Immediately posttreatment, massage resulted in lower muscle pain and soreness ratings compared with the supine-rest control condition (P{$<$}.0001), while both massage (P{$<$}.0001) and pneumatic compression (P{$<$}.01) resulted in lower overall muscular fatigue scores compared with the control group. There were no significant differences between groups in any outcome 1 to 7 days after the race.                                         Conclusion               Single 20-minute sessions of postrace massage and intermittent sequential pneumatic compression provide some immediate subjective benefit.

METHOD: We conducted a manual search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, with a search deadline set for February 1, 2023. Data analysis was performed using Stata version 15.0. RESULT: A total of 9 randomized controlled studies were included, involving a total of 316 people, including 159 mesenchymal stem cells and 147 control groups. Results of meta-analysis: Compared to a placebo group, the administration of mesenchymal stem cells resulted in a significant reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores among patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke [SMD=-0.99,95\% CI (-1.93, -0.05)]. Compared to placebo, barthel index [SMD\,=\,0.48,95\% CI (-0.55,1.51)], modified rankin score [SMD\,=\,0.45, 95\% CI (1.11, 0.21)], adverse events (RR\,=\,0.68, 95\% CI (0.40, 1.17)] the difference was not statistically significant.

  abstract = {The current focus of medicine on molecular genetics ignores the physical basis of disease even though many of the problems that lead to pain and morbidity, and bring patients to the doctor's office, result from changes in tissue structure or mechanics. The main goal of this article is therefore to help integrate mechanics into our understanding of the molecular basis of disease. This article first reviews the key roles that physical forces, extracellular matrix and cell structure play in the control of normal development, as well as in the maintenance of tissue form and function. Recent insights into cellular mechanotransduction--the molecular mechanism by which cells sense and respond to mechanical stress--also are described. Re-evaluation of human pathophysiology in this context reveals that a wide range of diseases included within virtually all fields of medicine and surgery share a common feature: their etiology or clinical presentation results from abnormal mechanotransduction. This process may be altered by changes in cell mechanics, variations in extracellular matrix structure, or by deregulation of the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense mechanical signals and convert them into a chemical or electrical response. Molecules that mediate mechanotransduction, including extracellular matrix molecules, transmembrane integrin receptors, cytoskeletal structures and associated signal transduction components, may therefore represent targets for therapeutic intervention in a variety of diseases. Insights into the mechanical basis of tissue regulation also may lead to development of improved medical devices, engineered tissues, and biologically-inspired materials for tissue repair and reconstruction.},

Research also indicates how biological grounding initiatives can sometimes be compromised, or inappropriate, and the need to take additional factors into account as potential contributory factors, or confounders, to expected results. It is proposed that expanding electromagnetic hygiene measures beyond biological grounding alone may help reduce spread of communicable diseases, incidence of respiratory conditions, neurodegenerative disease and all-cause mortality. Identifying potential synergies that exist could enable multilevel interventions to further increase the efficacy of measures.

Methods               A literature search was performed in PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase. Two researchers independently assessed eligibility and performed data extraction and quality assessments. Eligibility criteria: Study populations with ND, BFRE as intervention modality, outcome measures related to safety or efficacy.                                         Results               Out of 443 studies identified, 16 were deemed eligible for review. Three studies examined the efficacy and safety of BFRE, one study focused on efficacy results, and 12 studies investigated safety. Disease populations included spinal cord injury (SCI), inclusion body myositis (sIBM), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. A moderate-to-high risk of bias was presented in the quality assessment. Five studies reported safety concerns, including acutely elevated pain and rating of perceived exertion levels, severe fatigue, muscle soreness, and cases of autonomic dysreflexia. Two RCTs reported a significant between-group difference in physical function outcomes, and two RCTs reported neuromuscular adaptations.                                         Conclusion               BFRE seems to be a potentially safe and effective training modality in individuals with ND. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously due to limited quality and number of studies, small sample sizes, and a general lack of heterogeneity within and between the examined patient cohorts.},

DESIGN: A randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled trial. SETTINGS: Physiotherapy clinic at a university. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight patients were randomized into an 8-week (2 times/week) shoulder rehabilitation, that is, BFR or non-BFR group. INTERVENTIONS: BFR training. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) RC, deltoid, scapula retractor, and biceps muscle thicknesses and shoulder internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) strengths. (2) Shoulder pain/function. RESULTS: The BFR group had a greater increase in biceps muscle thickness ( P = 0.002) and shoulder IR strength at 60 degrees/s ( P = 0.040) than the non-BFR group. No differences between the 2 groups were observed in other measurements. Significant improvements in supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and scapula retractor muscle thicknesses and in shoulder ER and IR strengths were observed over time in both the groups (all P {$<$} 0 .05). Also, shoulder pain decreased and shoulder function increased over time in both the groups (all P {$<$} 0 .05). CONCLUSIONS: Low-load BFR training resulted in a greater increase in biceps thickness and shoulder IR strength compared with the non-BFR group in patients with RC tendinopathy. However, there was no superiority of either exercise training regarding the RC, scapula retractor, deltoid muscle thicknesses, or improvements in shoulder ER strength and shoulder pain/function.

The purpose of the present study was to systematically review the clinical and functional outcomes following mesenchymal stem cell application focusing on early to moderate knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: A systematic search was done using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. All Studies published between 2017 and March 2023 on patients treated with single mesenchymal stem cell injection for Kellgren-Lawrence grade I-III knee osteoarthritis reported on clinical and functional outcomes were included. RESULTS: Twelve articles comprising 539 patients and 576 knees treated with a single intraarticular injection of MSCs for knee osteoarthritis were included in the current systematic review. In eligible studies, the reported outcomes were improved concerning patient-reported outcomes measures, knee function, pain relief, and quality of patient's life. CONCLUSION: Based on high-level evidence studies, single intraarticular injection of MSCs is a safe, reliable, and effective treatment option for Kellgren-Lawrence grade I-III knee osteoarthritis. However, the lack of homogeneity in the included studies and the variance in MSCs sources and preparations should be noted. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.},

This study's purpose was to survey clinicians on BFR use in people with neurologic conditions. [Participants and Methods] One-hundred twelve physical therapists and other healthcare professionals who reported using BFR in the past 5\>years completed an anonymous, online survey. [Results] Eighty-nine percent of respondents thought BFR was safe in people with neurologic conditions. Meanwhile, 38\% reported BFR use in people with neurologic conditions. The most common intervention used with BFR was resistance training (n=33) and the most commonly reported benefit was improved strength (n=27). The most common side-effect causing treatment to stop was intolerance to pressure (n=6). No side-effects requiring medical attention were reported. In order to support future BFR use in neurologic populations, the most common response was the need for more research (n=63). [Conclusion] Despite the lack of evidence, clinical use of BFR in people with neurologic conditions may be somewhat common. Although this study had a relatively small sample size and collected data retrospectively, the results support the potential clinical feasibility and safety of BFR use in patients with neurologic conditions and suggest that more research is needed.},

Therefore, athletes' ability to deal with dual-tasks may be different from the non-athlete population, demanding a deeper investigation within the sports domain. This study aimed to systematically review the acute and chronic effects of dual-tasks in motor and cognitive performances in athletes from different modalities. The search for articles followed all the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The keywords used were: ``dual-task'' OR ``double task'' OR ``multi-task'' OR ``divided attention'' OR ``secondary task'' OR ``second task'' AND ``working memory'' OR ``visual'' OR ``decision making'' OR ``gaze behavior'' OR ``attention'' AND ``sports'' OR ``athletes'' OR ``players''. The Scopus, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases were screened for studies comparing single and dual-tasks, in which the participants were athletes competing at any level, and in which at least one of the following variables were investigated: working memory, decision-making, visual search behavior, perception, anticipation, attention, or motor tasks. Articles were screened using pre-defined selection criteria, and methodological quality was assessed by two researchers independently. Following the eligibility criteria, we included 18 articles in the review: 13 on the acute effects, and five on the chronic effects. This review showed that the acute effect of dual-tasks impairs the motor and cognitive performances of athletes (dual-task cost). However, training with dual-tasks (chronic effect) improved working memory skills and attentional control. We conclude that dual-tasks acutely and chronically impacts motor and cognitive performance.},

  abstract = {Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a modality with growing interest in the last decade and has been recognized as a critical tool in rehabilitation medicine, athletic and clinical populations. Besides its potential for positive benefits, BFRT has the capability to induce adverse responses. BFRT may evoke increased blood pressure, abnormal cardiovascular responses and impact vascular health. Furthermore, some important concerns with the use of BFRT exists for individuals with established cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease patients). In addition, considering the potential risks of thrombosis promoted by BFRT in medically compromised populations, BFRT use warrants caution for patients that already display impaired blood coagulability, loss of antithrombotic mechanisms in the vessel wall, and stasis caused by immobility (e.g., COVID-19 patients, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, orthopedic post-surgery, anabolic steroid and ergogenic substance users, rheumatoid arthritis, and pregnant/postpartum women). To avoid untoward outcomes and ensure that BFRT is properly used, efficacy endpoints such as a questionnaire for risk stratification involving a review of the patient's medical history, signs, and symptoms indicative of underlying pathology is strongly advised. Here we present a model for BFRT pre-participation screening to theoretically reduce risk by excluding people with comorbidities or medically complex histories that could unnecessarily heighten intra- and/or post-exercise occurrence of adverse events. We propose this risk stratification tool as a framework to allow clinicians to use their knowledge, skills and expertise to assess and manage any risks related to the delivery of an appropriate BFRT exercise program. The questionnaires for risk stratification are adapted to guide clinicians for the referral, assessment, and suggestion of other modalities/approaches if/when necessary. Finally, the risk stratification might serve as a guideline for clinical protocols and future randomized controlled trial studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several systematic reviews have evaluated the role of dual-task assessment in individuals with concussion. However, no systematic reviews to date have investigated dual-task protocols with implications for individuals with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury or ACL reconstruction (ACLR). PURPOSE: To systematically review the evidence on dual-task assessment practices applicable to those with ACL deficiency/ACLR, specifically with the aim to identify motor-cognitive performance costs. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic literature review was undertaken on those with ACL-deficient or ACL-reconstructed knees performing dual-task activities. The following databases were searched from inception to June 8, 2018 including CINAHL, PsychInfo, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and gray literature. Three primary search categories (knee, cognition, and motor task) were included. Only one reviewer independently performed the database search, data extraction, and scored each article for quality. All studies were assessed for quality and pertinent data were extracted, examined and synthesized. RESULTS: Ten studies were included for analysis, all of which were published within the prior ten years. Performance deficits were identified in those with either ACL deficiency or ACLR while dual-tasking, such as prioritization of postural control at the expense of cognitive performance, impaired postural control in single limb stance, greater number of cognitive errors, and increased step width coefficient of variation while walking. No studies examined those with prior ACL injury or ACLR during tasks that mimicked ACL injury mechanisms such as jump-landing or single-leg cutting. CONCLUSION: The results of the current systematic review suggests that postural control, gait, and/or cognitive deficits exist when evaluated under a dual-task paradigm in those with ACL deficiency or ACLR. This systematic review highlights the need for future research on dual-task assessment for individuals who have sustained an ACL injury or undergone ACLR, specifically utilizing more difficult athletic movements.

Such effects relate to inflammation, immune responses, wound healing, and prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The purpose of this report is two-fold: to 1) inform researchers about what appears to be a new perspective to the study of inflammation, and 2) alert researchers that the length of time and degree (resistance to ground) of grounding of experimental animals is an important but usually overlooked factor that can influence outcomes of studies of inflammation, wound healing, and tumorigenesis. Specifically, grounding an organism produces measurable differences in the concentrations of white blood cells, cytokines, and other molecules involved in the inflammatory response. We present several hypotheses to explain observed effects, based on current research results and our understanding of the electronic aspects of cell and tissue physiology, cell biology, biophysics, and biochemistry. An experimental injury to muscles, known as delayed onset muscle soreness, has been used to monitor the immune response under grounded versus ungrounded conditions. Grounding reduces pain and alters the numbers of circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes, and also affects various circulating chemical factors related to inflammation.},

During the period when this research was getting started, approximately 2000 to the present, scientists from around the world were establishing connections between inflammation and virtually all chronic diseases (Table 1) using the c-reactive protein assay developed by Ridker and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School. This article reviews Earthing, a safe therapy that optimizes (balances) each person's unique physiological functions; and that provides relief from the major diseases of the aging population; and that may slow the aging process itself. This statement is made because of the recognition that cumulative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS), sometimes referred to as free radicals, is one of the most widely studied theories of the cause of aging. Because the continuous semiconducting fabric of the body reaches into every part of the body, including the interiors of all cells and their nuclei, mobile electrons in the grounded or earthed person are thought to be capable of rapidly neutralizing ROS produced by oxidative metabolism taking place in every cell and tissue.},

  abstract = {Grounding is a therapeutic technique that involves doing activities that ``ground'' or electrically reconnect us to the earth. The physiological effects of grounding have been reported from a variety of perspectives such as sleep or pain. However, its anti-stress efficacy is relatively unknown. The present study investigated the stress-related behavioral effects of earthing mat and its neurohormonal mechanisms in the Sprague-Dawley male rat. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: the na{\"i}ve normal (Normal), the 21 days immobilization stressed (Control), the 21 days stressed + earthing mat for 7 days (A7) or 21 days (A21) group. The depressive-and anxiety like behaviors were measured by forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and elevated plus maze (EPM). Using immunohistochemistry, the expression of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and c-Fos immunoreactivity were analyzed in the brain. In the EPM, time spent in the open arm of the earthing mat groups was significantly increased compared to the Control group (p {$<$} 0.001), even though there were without effects among groups in the FST and TST. The expression of CRF immunoreactive neurons in the earthing mat group was markedly decreased compared to the Control group. Overall, the earthing mat reduced stress-induced behavioral changes and expression of c-Fos and CRF immunoreactivity in the brain. These results suggest that the earthing mat may have the potential to improve stress-related responses via the regulation of the corticotrophinergic system.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and although restoring striatal dopamine levels may improve symptoms, no treatment can cure or reverse the disease itself. Stem cell therapy has a regenerative effect and is being actively studied as a candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Mesenchymal stem cells are considered a promising option due to fewer ethical concerns, a lower risk of immune rejection, and a lower risk of teratogenicity. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells and their derivatives on motor function, memory, and preservation of dopaminergic neurons in a Parkinson's disease animal model. We searched bibliographic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science) to identify articles and included only peer-reviewed               in vivo               interventional animal studies published in any language through June 28, 2023. The study utilized the random-effect model to estimate the 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of the standard mean differences (SMD) between the treatment and control groups. We use the systematic review center for laboratory animal experimentation's risk of bias tool and the collaborative approach to meta-analysis and review of animal studies checklist for study quality assessment. A total of 33 studies with data from 840 Parkinson's disease model animals were included in the meta-analysis. Treatment with mesenchymal stem cells significantly improved motor function as assessed by the amphetamine-induced rotational test. Among the stem cell types, the bone marrow MSCs with neurotrophic factor group showed largest effect size (SMD [95\% CI] = --6.21 [--9.50 to --2.93],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 0.0 \%). The stem cell treatment group had significantly more tyrosine hydroxylase positive dopaminergic neurons in the striatum ([95\% CI] = 1.04 [0.59 to 1.49],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 65.1 \%) and substantia nigra (SMD [95\% CI] = 1.38 [0.89 to 1.87],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 75.3 \%), indicating a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons. Subgroup analysis of the amphetamine-induced rotation test showed a significant reduction only in the intracranial-striatum route (SMD [95\% CI] = --2.59 [--3.25 to --1.94],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 74.4 \%). The memory test showed significant improvement only in the intravenous route (SMD [95\% CI] = 4.80 [1.84 to 7.76],               P               = 0.027,               I               2               = 79.6 \%). Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to positively impact motor function and memory function and protect dopaminergic neurons in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease. Further research is required to determine the optimal stem cell types, modifications, transplanted cell numbers, and delivery methods for these protocols.},

METHODS: We asked 22 elite and 20 intermediate basketball players, and 23 non-athletes, to perform an MOT task under three attentional load conditions (two, three, and four targets). Accuracies were analyzed to examine whether different levels of sports expertise influence MOT task performance. RESULTS: The elite athletes displayed better tracking performance compared with the intermediate or non-athletes when tracking three or four targets. However, no significant difference was found between the intermediate athletes and the non-athletes. Further, no differences were observed among the three groups when tracking two targets. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the effects of expertise in team ball sports could transfer to a non-sports-specific attention task. These transfer effects to general cognitive functions occur only in elite athletes with extensive training under higher attentional load.},

The aim of the present work is to verify the theoretical adequacy of the various scoring methods used to measure the Stroop effect. We present a systematic review of studies that have provided normative data for the SCWT. We referred to both electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar) and citations. Our findings show that while several scoring methods have been reported in literature, none of the reviewed methods enables us to fully assess the Stroop effect. Furthermore, we discuss several normative scoring methods from the Italian panorama as reported in literature. We claim for an alternative scoring method which takes into consideration both speed and accuracy of the response. Finally, we underline the importance of assessing the performance in all Stroop Test conditions (word reading, color naming, named color-word).},

The breath of validation from previous published data and real-life testimonials is a testimony of the earth's dramatic impact on healing the human body. Health information is constantly changing as a result of new research in various approaches to treating a multitude of inflammatory conditions. Sometimes, even with the most relevant published data, it is difficult to choose which advice is most conducive for healing. For example, it has been noted that perhaps one-third of the medical literature could be fraudulent.. Understanding absolute versus relative risk can also be confusing even for health professionals. And when data is reported in relative risk, only a fraction of the real science is revealed.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to answer the question: Does the contact of the human organism with the Earth via a copper conductor affect physiologic processes? Subjects and experiments: Five (5) experiments are presented: experiment 1-effect of earthing on calcium-phosphate homeostasis and serum concentrations of iron (N\,=\,84 participants); experiment 2-effect of earthing on serum concentrations of electrolytes (N\,=\,28); experiment 3-effect of earthing on thyroid function (N\,=\,12); experiment 4-effect of earthing on glucose concentration (N\,=\,12); experiment 5-effect of earthing on immune response to vaccine (N\,=\,32). Subjects were divided into two groups. One (1) group of people was earthed, while the second group remained without contact with the Earth. Blood and urine samples were examined. RESULTS: Earthing of an electrically insulated human organism during night rest causes lowering of serum concentrations of iron, ionized calcium, inorganic phosphorus, and reduction of renal excretion of calcium and phosphorus. Earthing during night rest decreases free tri-iodothyronine and increases free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone. The continuous earthing of the human body decreases blood glucose in patients with diabetes. Earthing decreases sodium, potassium, magnesium, iron, total protein, and albumin concentrations while the levels of transferrin, ferritin, and globulins {$\alpha$}1, {$\alpha$}2, {$\beta$}, and {$\gamma$} increase. These results are statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Earthing the human body influences human physiologic processes. This influence is observed during night relaxation and during physical activity. Effect of the earthing on calcium-phosphate homeostasis is the opposite of that which occurs in states of weightlessness. It also increases the activity of catabolic processes. It may be the primary factor regulating endocrine and nervous systems.},

  abstract = {Neuromodulation is a process of inhibition, stimulation, modification and regulation or therapeutic alteration of activity, electrically and chemically in the peripheral, central or autonomic nervous systems. Direct electric current or electric field alternates the function of nervous system. Coupling the human organism with the Earth directly or via a wire conductor changes the electric potential not only on the surface of the body but also inside it, changing the potential of electric environment of the human organism. Earthing refers to a direct contact with the Earth with bare feet or contact with the Earth with the use of conductive wire attached to the human body during sleeping, or daily activities. During earthing this electric potential equals to electric potential of the Earth and the value of it depends on location, time, atmospheric conditions, moisture of the surface of the Earth. The earthing which changes the density of negative charge in electric environment of the human body influences physiological processes. Our medical hypothesis states that contact with the Earth (earthing) directly or via a conductive wire plays role as a neuromodulative factor, probably primary, which enables the nervous system to be better adapted to the demands of organism and ambient environment. It helps to restore natural, electrical status of the electrical environment of the organism and thus the nervous system. Earthing generates immediate changes in electroencephalography (EEG), surface electromyography (SEMG), and somato-sensory evoked potentials (SSEPs). We hypothesize that earthing through its complex action on bioelectrical environment of human organism and alternations in electrolyte concentrations regulates correct functioning of the nervous system. Earthing significantly influences on the electrical activity of the brain.},

Endurance training and racing stress the skeletal muscle, resulting in exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). Athletes attempt to aid their recovery in various ways, one of which is through compression. Dynamic compression consists of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices, such as the NormaTec Recovery System and Recovery Pump. Clinical Question: What are the effects of IPC on the reduction of EIMD in endurance athletes following prolonged exercise? Summary of Key Findings: The current literature was searched to identify the effects of IPC, and 3 studies were selected: 2 randomized controlled trials and 1 randomized cross-over study. Two studies investigated the effect of IPC on delayed onset muscle soreness and plasma creatine kinase in ultramarathoners. The other looked at the impact of IPC on delayed onset muscle soreness in marathoners, ultramarathoners, triathletes, and cyclists. All studies concluded IPC was not an effective means of improving the reduction of EIMD in endurance-trained athletes. Clinical Bottom Line: While IPC may provide short-term relief of delayed onset muscle soreness, this device does not provide continued relief from EIMD. Strength of Recommendation: In accordance with the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, the grade of B is recommended based on consistent evidence from 2 high-quality randomized controlled trials and 1 randomized cross-over study.},

PURPOSE: To determine if athletes who suffer a noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury demonstrate decreased baseline neurocognitive performance when compared with matched controls. STUDY DESIGN: Case control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The baseline scores from a computerized neurocognitive test battery (ImPACT) were analyzed to compare verbal memory, visual memory, processing speed, and reaction time. Eighty intercollegiate athletes who, subsequent to testing, experienced noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries, were matched with 80 controls based on height, weight, age, gender, sport, position, and years of experience at the collegiate level. RESULTS: Statistical differences were found between the noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury group and the matched controls on all 4 neurocognitive subtests. Noncontact anterior cruciate ligament-injured athletes demonstrated significantly slower reaction time (F(1,158) = 9.66, P = .002) and processing speed (F(1,158) = 12.04, P = .001) and performed worse on visual (F(1,158) = 19.16, P = .000) and verbal memory (F(1,158) = 4.08, P = .045) composite scores when compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Neurocognitive differences may be associated with the loss of neuromuscular control and coordination errors, predisposing certain intercollegiate athletes to noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries.},

This article systematically summarizes that it is well used in basic research and clinical studies to promote inflammatory chondrogenesis in the treatment of OA. Provide a theoretical basis for clinical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study collected CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed, and articles related to the treatment of OA with HUC-MSCs since their publication, excluding non-basic and clinical studies such as reviews and meta-analysis. A total of 31 basic experimental studies and 12 clinical studies were included. Systematically analyze the effects of HUC-MSCs on inhibiting inflammatory factors, promoting chondrocyte production, and current clinical treatment. RESULTS: HUC-MSCs can reduce inflammatory factors such as MMP-13, ADAMTS-5, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-{$\alpha$}, induced conversion from M1 to M2 in OA to protect cartilage damage and reduce OA inflammation. Synthesize ColII, SOX9, and aggrecan at the same time to promote cartilage synthesis. CONCLUSION: HUC-MSCs not only have typical stem cell biological characteristics, but also have rich sources and convenient material extraction. Compared with stem cells from other sources, HUC-MSCs have stronger proliferation, differentiation, and immune regulation abilities. Furthermore, there are no ethical issues associated with their use. SAFETY: Primarily attributed to pain, the majority of individuals experience recovery within 24~h following injection. HUC-MSCs possess the ability to alleviate pain, enhance knee joint function, and potentially postpone the need for surgical intervention in both non-surgical and other cases, making them highly deserving of clinical promotion and application.},
