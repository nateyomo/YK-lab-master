  abstract = {Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury rates are on the rise, despite improved surgical techniques and prevention programs. While traditional rehabilitation emphasizes the restoration of motion, strength, and physical performance, emerging research highlights the importance of addressing neurocognitive deficits that can persist after injury. These deficits, including altered proprioception, impaired motor control and muscle recruitment, as well as heightened reliance on visual feedback, can significantly increase the risk of re-injury and impede return to sport. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to outline a proposed comprehensive approach to rehabilitation that challenges the neurocognitive system to optimize rehabilitation outcomes and reduce reinjury risk. Thus, this clinical commentary discusses the rationale for integrating neurocognitive training into all phases of ACLR rehabilitation, from initial injury to eight weeks post-surgery. It details the neurophysiological changes caused by ACL injury and presents evidence supporting the use of exercises that challenge visual attention, decision-making, and motor planning. A comprehensive rehabilitation framework incorporating both physical and neurocognitive components is proposed, aiming to improve long-term outcomes and reduce re-injury risk. Level of Evidence: 5.},

  abstract = {Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is a commonly performed procedure in Orthopaedic sports medicine. With advances in surgical techniques providing better positioning and fixation of the graft, subsequent graft failure to certain extent should be accounted by poor graft healing. Although different biological modulations for enhancement of graft healing have been tried in different clinical and animal studies, complete graft incorporation into bone tunnels and the "ligamentization" of the intra-articular part have not been fully achieved yet. Based on the understanding of graft healing process and its failure mechanism, the purpose of this review is to combine both the known basic science \& clinical evidence, to provide a much clearer picture of the obstacle encountered in graft healing, so as to facilitate researchers on subsequent work on the enhancement of ACL graft healing.},
