  abstract = {Analgesic design and evaluation have been driven by the desire to create high-affinity high-selectivity mu ({$\mu$})-opioid peptide (MOP) receptor agonists. Such ligands are the mainstay of current clinical practice, and include morphine and fentanyl. Advances in this sphere have come from designing pharmacokinetic advantage, as in rapid metabolism for remifentanil. These produce analgesia, but also the adverse-effect profile that currently defines this drug class: ventilatory depression, tolerance, and abuse liability. The MOP receptor is part of a family, and there are significant functional interactions between other members of the family (delta [{$\delta$}]-opioid peptide [DOP], kappa [{$\kappa$}]-opioid peptide [KOP], and nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor [NOP]). Experimentally, MOP agonism and DOP antagonism produce anti-nociception (animals) with no tolerance, and low doses of MOP and NOP ligands synergise to antinociceptive advantage. In this latter context, the lack of effect of NOP agonists on ventilation is an additional advantage. Recent development has been to move towards low-selectivity multifunctional 'mixed ligands', such as cebranopadol, or ligand mixtures, such as Targinact{\textregistered}. Moreover, the observation that {$\beta$}-arrestin coupling underlies the side-effect profile for MOP ligands (from knockout animal studies) led to the discovery of biased (to G-protein and away from {$\beta$}-arrestin intracellular signalling) MOP ligands, such as oliceridine. There is sufficient excitement in the opioid field to suggest that opioid analgesics without significant side-effects may be on the horizon, and the 'opioid Holy Grail' might be in reach.},

  abstract = {Tenecteplase (TNK) is a single-bolus recombinant fibrinolytic agent used to manage intravascular clots. The drug is in the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) class of medications. FDA-approved indications include acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Tenecteplase is the thrombolytic agent of choice for acute myocardial infarction. Tenecteplase is becoming more widely used as a thrombolytic agent despite its off-label use in acute ischemic strokes largely because of its efficacy when compared with the FDA-approved alteplase. This activity explores the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse event profile, toxicities, and monitoring of tenecteplase to assist the interprofessional team in caring for patients who need thrombolytic therapy.},

  abstract = {Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is classified as a serine protease (enzymes that cleave peptide bonds in proteins). It is thus one of the essential components of the dissolution of blood clots. Its primary function includes catalyzing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, the primary enzyme involved in dissolving blood clots. Examples of these drugs include alteplase, reteplase, and tenecteplase. Indications for the use of tPA include ischemic stroke (most common) in patients presenting to treating facility within 3 hours (4.5 hours in certain, eligible patients) after the onset of symptoms, myocardial Infarction if there would be a delay of more than 1 to 2 hours before percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, pulmonary embolism in massive pulmonary embolisms, causing severe instability due to high pressure on the heart, and thrombolysis (e.g., deep vein thrombosis). This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of tPA agents so providers can direct patient therapy where they are indicated as part of the interprofessional team.},
