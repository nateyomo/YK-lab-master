  abstract = {Through four outstanding editions, this highly regarded text has provided a clear, surgeon's-point of view of orthopaedic anatomy using easy-to-follow descriptions accompanied by hundreds of superb, full-color illustrations. The state-of-the-art fifth edition brings you up to date with recent changes in the field, using a highly relevant anatomic approach that has become increasingly important as approaches become smaller. Designed to increase your anatomic knowledge, increase safety, and improve patient outcomes, this updated resource is a must-have reference for today's orthopaedic surgeon. Key Features: Each chapter details the techniques and pitfalls of a surgical approach, gives a clear preview of anatomic landmarks and incisions, and highlights potential dangers of superficial and deep dissection; Updates of existing surgical approaches include expanded approaches for emergency decompression of a compartment syndrome of the lower leg and forearm, as well as the addition of a classic approach to fixation of distal radial fractures; New coverage of the posterior and postero-lateral approaches to the tibial plateau, surgical dislocation of the hip, a minimally invasive anterior approach to the hip joint, and the lateral approach to the metatarso phalangeal joint of the hallux; Revisions include clear depictions of the iliopectinal fascia and the step technique for the flip osteotomy of the greater trochanter. -- Publisher},

Subsequent chapters succinctly discuss management of a comprehensive range of shoulder conditions, organized by the underlying type of pathology. The final chapters provide insightful pearls on shoulder rehabilitation and perioperative pain management"--},
