  abstract = {Background Football is a highly competitive sport, and participants can experience various contact and non-contact sports injuries in the sporting process. In any elite sport, screening players using different scientific tools is an important injury prevention strategy. The Y- Balance test (YBT) was found to be a predictive tool for non-contact injury. However, the use of criteria from these tests to predict injuries has not been substantiated and should be further investigated. Purpose The aim~of this study was to determine the predictors for injury among athletes using baseline YBT, number of matches, and minutes of physical activity; the cutoff scores for predictors of injury, including baseline YBT, number of matches, and minutes of physical activity; and~the clinical prediction rules for predicting injury in this population. Methods A total of 39 young student football players were included in this study. The mean age was 20.28 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.83 kg/m2. A baseline assessment of the participant's characteristics was taken and each participant performed the YBT once before starting the league. After the university league football players had finished their tournament, we asked them questions related to non-contact injuries. Results The results showed that the prevalence of injury was 17.95\% among this population. An increase in the YBT score was significantly associated with a decrease in the odds of having an injury [odds ratio (OR) 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.94 (0.88, 0.99), p = 0.047). In addition, the number of matches was significantly associated with an increase in the odds of having an injury p = 0.012. However, the minutes of physical activity were not statistically significant p = 0.065.~The highest Youden index was {$\leq$}97.89, with a sensitivity of 87.50\% and specificity of 71.43\%, for the posterior medial reach and {$\leq$}92.88, with a sensitivity of 90.62\% and specificity of 57.14\%, for the posterior lateral reach.~The clinical prediction rule was an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88. Conclusions The results of the study provide evidence for the potential utility of the YBT as a predictor tool for evaluating non-contact injuries in university league football players. By identifying players with lower YBT scores who were at higher risk for injury, targeted interventions could be implemented to address functional movement deficits and potentially reduce injury risk.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Return-to-activity (RTA) assessments are commonly administered after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) to manage the patient's postoperative progressions back to activity. To date, few data are available on the clinical utility of these assessments to predict patient outcomes such as secondary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury once the athlete has returned to activity. OBJECTIVE: To identify the measures of patient function at 6 months post-ACLR that best predict RTA and second ACL injury at a minimum of 2 years after ACLR. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 patients with primary, unilateral ACLR completed functional assessments at approximately 6 months post-ACLR. Of these, 192 (82.1\%) completed follow-up at {$\geq$}2 years post-ACLR. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The 6-month functional assessments consisted of patient-reported outcomes, isokinetic knee-flexor and -extensor strength, and single-legged hopping. We collected RTA and secondary ACL injury data at {$\geq$}2 years after ACLR. RESULTS: Of the patients who were able to RTA (n = 155), 44 (28.4\%) had a subsequent ACL injury, 24 (15.5\%) to the ipsilateral graft ACL and 20 (12.9\%) to the contralateral ACL. A greater proportion of females had a secondary injury to the contralateral ACL (15/24, 62.5\%), whereas a greater proportion of males reinjured the ipsilateral ACL graft (15/20, 75.0\%; P = .017). Greater knee-extension symmetry at 6 months increased the probability of reinjury (B = 0.016, P = .048). Among patients with RTA at {$<$}8 months, every 1\% increase in quadriceps strength symmetry at 6 months increased the risk of reinjury by 2.1\% (B = 0.021, P = .05). Among patients with RTA at {$>$}8 months, every month that RTA was delayed reduced the risk of reinjury by 28.4\% (B = -0.284, P = .042). Descriptive statistics of patient function stratified between the early and delayed RTA groups can be found in the Supplemental Table (available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0407.20.S1). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with more symmetric quadriceps strength at 6 months post-ACLR were more likely to experience another ACL rupture, especially those who returned to sport at {$<$}8 months after the index surgery. Clinicians should be cognizant that returning high-functioning patients to activity at {$<$}8 months post-ACLR may place them at an increased risk for reinjury.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical therapy (PT) rehabilitation is critical to successful outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Later-stage rehabilitation, including sport-specific exercises, is increasingly recognized for restoring high-level knee function. However, supervised PT visits have historically been concentrated during the early stages of recovery after ACLR. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the number and temporal utilization of PT visits after ACLR in a national cohort. We hypothesized that PT visits would be concentrated early in the postoperative period. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiological study. METHODS: The Humana PearlDiver database was searched to identify patients who underwent ACLR between 2007 and 2017. Patients with additional structures treated were excluded. The mean {\textpm} SD, median and interquartile range (IQR), and range of number of PT visits for each patient were determined for the 52 weeks after ACLR. PT visits over time were also assessed in relation to patient age and sex. RESULTS: In total, 11,518 patients who underwent ACLR met the inclusion criteria; the mean age was 32.62 {\textpm} 13.70 years, and 42.7\% were female patients. Of this study cohort, 10,381 (90.4\%) had documented PT postoperatively; the range of PT visits was 0 to 121. On average, patients had 16.90 {\textpm} 10.60 PT visits (median [IQR], 16 [9-22]) after ACLR. Patients completed a mean of 52\% of their PT visits in the first 6 weeks, 75\% in the first 10 weeks, and 90\% in the first 16 weeks after surgery. Patients aged 10 to 19 years had the highest number of PT visits (mean {\textpm} SD, 19.67 {\textpm} 12.09; median [IQR], 18 [12-25]), significantly greater than other age groups (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: PT after ACLR is concentrated in the early postoperative period. Physicians, therapists, and patients may consider adjusting the limited access to PT to optimize patient recovery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As supervised PT visits may be limited, the appropriate temporal utilization of supervised PT visits must be maximized. Strategies to ensure sessions for later neuromuscular and activity-specific rehabilitation are needed.},

DESIGN: Overview of systematic reviews with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Library. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials investigating rehabilitation interventions following ACL and/or meniscal tears in young adults. RESULTS: We included 22 systematic reviews (142 trials of mostly men) evaluating ACL-injured individuals and none evaluating isolated meniscal injuries. We synthesised data from 16 reviews evaluating 12 different interventions. Moderate-certainty evidence was observed for: (1) neuromuscular electrical stimulation to improve quadriceps strength; (2) open versus closed kinetic chain exercises to be similarly effective for quadriceps strength and self-reported function; (3) structured home-based versus structured in-person rehabilitation to be similarly effective for quadriceps and hamstring strength and self-reported function; and (4) postoperative knee bracing being ineffective for physical function and laxity. There was low-certainty evidence that: (1) preoperative exercise therapy improves self-reported and physical function postoperatively; (2) cryotherapy reduces pain and analgesic use; (3) psychological interventions improve anxiety/fear; and (4) whole body vibration improves quadriceps strength. There was very low-certainty evidence that: (1) protein-based supplements improve quadriceps size; (2) blood flow restriction training improves quadriceps size; (3) neuromuscular control exercises improve quadriceps and hamstring strength and self-reported function; and (4) continuous passive motion has no effect on range of motion. CONCLUSION: The general level of evidence for rehabilitation after ACL or meniscal tear was low. Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that several rehabilitation types can improve quadriceps strength, while brace use has no effect on knee function/laxity.},

There is sparse evidence to guide return to sport (RTS) decisions in this population. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between knee reinjury after ACL reconstruction and (1) return to level I sports, (2) timing of RTS and (3) knee function prior to return. METHODS: 106 patients who participated in pivoting sports participated in this prospective 2-year cohort study. Sports participation and knee reinjury were recorded monthly. Knee function was assessed with the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale, global rating scale of function, and quadriceps strength and hop test symmetry. Pass RTS criteria were defined as scores {$>$}90 on all tests, failure as failing any. RESULTS: Patients who returned to level I sports had a 4.32 (p=0.048) times higher reinjury rate than those who did not. The reinjury rate was significantly reduced by 51\% for each month RTS was delayed until 9\>months after surgery, after which no further risk reduction was observed. 38.2\% of those who failed RTS criteria suffered reinjuries versus 5.6\% of those who passed (HR 0.16, p=0.075). More symmetrical quadriceps strength prior to return significantly reduced the knee reinjury rate. CONCLUSIONS: Returning to level I sports after ACL reconstruction leads to a more than 4-fold increase in reinjury rates over 2\>years. RTS 9\>months or later after surgery and more symmetrical quadriceps strength prior to return substantially reduce the reinjury rate.},

Although previous research has demonstrated reliability and validity of the form, its responsiveness has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to determine responsiveness of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Patients who participated in the original validation study for the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form completed the form and a 7-level global rating of change scale that ranged from greatly worse to greatly better after a mean of 1.6 years (range, 0.5-2.3 years). Analyses included calculation of the standardized response mean and mean change in International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form score compared to the patient's perception of change on the global rating of change scale. In addition, a receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted to determine the change in score that best distinguished patients who improved from those who did not. RESULTS: The overall standardized response mean was 0.94, which is considered large. With the exception of those who were slightly worse or unchanged, the mean change in the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form score compared to the patients' perceived global ratings of change was as expected (greatly worse, -15.1; somewhat worse, -8.4; slightly worse, 20.6; no change, 10.7; slightly better, 5.9; somewhat better, 18.1; greatly better, 38.7). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a change score of 11.5 points had the highest sensitivity, and a change score of 20.5 points had the highest specificity to distinguish between those who were or were not improved. CONCLUSION: The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form is a responsive measure of symptoms, function, and sports activity for patients with a variety of knee conditions.},

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary care outpatient orthopaedic clinic/ambulatory surgery center. SUBJECTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven subjects were separated into three groups based on their type of knee surgery and within each group randomized into a treatment or placebo group. INTERVENTIONS: All subjects received home IFC units. Subjects randomized to treatment group received a working IFC unit. Placebo subjects received units that were previously set to deliver no current. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Post-operative edema at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and weeks 1-8; range of motion at 1, 3, 6, and 9 weeks; pain immediately after surgery, at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and weeks 1-7; and amount of pain medication taken at days 1-10 were compared between treatment and placebo groups. RESULTS: All IFC subjects reported significantly less pain and had significantly greater range of motion at all post-operative time points. ACL and menisectomy IFC subjects experienced significantly less edema at all time points, while chondroplasty subjects experienced significantly less edema until 4 weeks postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that home IFC may help reduce pain, pain medication taken, and swelling while increasing range of motion in patients undergoing knee surgery. This could result in quicker return to activities of daily living and athletic activities.},

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether a set of objective discharge criteria, including muscle strength and functional tests, are associated with risk of ACL graft rupture after RTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 158 male professional athletes who underwent an ACL reconstruction and returned to their previous professional level of sport were included. Before players returned to sport they underwent a battery of discharge tests (isokinetic strength testing at 60{$^\circ$}, 180{$^\circ$} and 300{$^\circ$}/s, a running t test, single hop, triple hop and triple crossover hop tests). Athletes were monitored for ACL re-ruptures once they returned to sport (median follow-up 646\>days, range 1-2060). RESULTS: Of the 158 athletes, 26 (16.5\%) sustained an ACL graft rupture an average of 105\>days after RTS. Two factors were associated with increased risk of ACL graft rupture: (1) not meeting all six of the discharge criteria before returning to team training (HR 4.1, 95\% CI 1.9 to 9.2, p{$\leq$}0.001); and (2) decreased hamstring to quadriceps ratio of the involved leg at 60{$^\circ$}/s (HR 10.6 per 10\% difference, 95\% CI 10.2 to 11, p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Athletes who did not meet the discharge criteria before returning to professional sport had a four times greater risk of sustaining an ACL graft rupture compared with those who met all six RTS criteria. In addition, hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio deficits were associated with an increased risk of an ACL graft rupture.},

Numerous interval sport programs have been published in the literature and return to sports guidelines and criteria-based progressions for returning to sport have been published, but no such protocol exists for returning to the task of sprinting. Any field or court athlete must be able to sprint as part of his/her sport demands. Because of the absence of a specific progression, sports rehabilitation professionals lack knowledge about objective criteria to progress to sprinting as well as a progressive program to do so. Given that sports rehabilitation professionals have limited visits to complete rehabilitation or their athletes have limited financial resources to do so, it is imperative that a structured, criteria-based progression be available. The purpose of this clinical suggestion is to provide a criteria-based return to sprinting progression. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.},

  abstract = {This article is a description of the surgical treatment and rehabilitation of combined complex ligament injuries. A background will be provided, and information on the combined complex knee injuries, selected aspects of surgical treatments, and rehabilitation strategies will be presented. Combined complex ligament injuries are devastating injuries and are not very common compared to other knee injuries. No meta-analysis or systematic review studies exist regarding the best treatments for these patients. This article's emphasis is on the stages in the rehabilitation program with documentation of the scientific and clinical rationale for the treatment techniques in each stage. Treatment interventions are described and documented with the limited evidence available in treating these patients. Guidelines for treatment, surgery, and a clinical protocol for treating patients with combined complex ligament injuries are provided for the practicing clinician to use as a template for treating these complicated patients.},

  abstract = {The knee joint kinematics of a group (n=20) of elderly normal subjects (mean age=67 years) were investigated using flexible electrogoniometry. The flexion-extension angle of the knee was recorded during a range of functional activities performed as part of a circuit in and around the hospital. The functions analysed including gait, walking on slopes, stair negotiation, the use of standard and low chairs and a bath. The data were used to produce the pattern of joint angulation against the percentage of the cycle for each individual conducting each activity. Further the maximum and minimum knee joint angles and the excursion of the joint during the cycle were identified. The results indicate gait and slopes require less than 90 degrees of knee flexion, stairs and chairs 90-120 degrees of flexion and a bath approximately 135 degrees of flexion. The data suggests that 110 degrees of flexion would seem a suitable goal for the rehabilitation of motion in the knee. It is concluded that flexible electrogoniometry is a suitable and practical method for evaluating knee motion during a range of functional activities.},

  abstract = {Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is a commonly performed procedure in Orthopaedic sports medicine. With advances in surgical techniques providing better positioning and fixation of the graft, subsequent graft failure to certain extent should be accounted by poor graft healing. Although different biological modulations for enhancement of graft healing have been tried in different clinical and animal studies, complete graft incorporation into bone tunnels and the "ligamentization" of the intra-articular part have not been fully achieved yet. Based on the understanding of graft healing process and its failure mechanism, the purpose of this review is to combine both the known basic science \& clinical evidence, to provide a much clearer picture of the obstacle encountered in graft healing, so as to facilitate researchers on subsequent work on the enhancement of ACL graft healing.},
