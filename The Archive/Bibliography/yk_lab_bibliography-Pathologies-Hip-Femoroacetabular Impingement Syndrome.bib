  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgery for hip femoroacetabular impingement/acetabular labral tear (FAI/ALT) is exponentially increasing despite lacking investigation of the accuracy of various diagnostic measures. Useful clinical utility of these measures is necessary to support diagnostic imaging and subsequent surgical decision-making. OBJECTIVE: Summarise/evaluate the current diagnostic accuracy of various clinical tests germane to hip FAI/ALT pathology. METHODS: A computer-assisted literature search of MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE databases using keywords related to diagnostic accuracy of the hip joint, as well as the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the search and reporting phases of the study. Quality assessment of bias and applicability was conducted using the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Random effects models were used to summarise sensitivities (SN), specificities (SP), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and respective confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The employed search strategy revealed 21 potential articles, with one demonstrating high quality. Nine articles qualified for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated that flexion-adduction-internal rotation (pooled SN ranging from 0.94 (95\% CI 0.90 to 0.97) to 0.99 (95\% CI 0.98 to 1.00); DOR 5.71 (95\% CI 0.84 to 38.86) to 7.82 (95\% CI 1.06 to 57.84)) and flexion-internal rotation (pooled SN 0.96 (95\% CI 0.81 to 0.99); DOR 8.36 (95\% CI 0.41 to 171.3) tests possess only screening accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Few hip physical examination tests for diagnosing FAI/ALT have been investigated in enough studies of substantial quality to direct clinical decision-making. Further high-quality studies across a wider spectrum of hip pathology patients are recommended to discern the confirmed clinical utility of these tests.

  abstract = {Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a motion-related pathology of the hip characterized by pain, morphological abnormalities of the proximal femur, and an elevated risk of joint deterioration and hip osteoarthritis. Activities that require deep flexion are understood to induce impingement in cam FAIS patients, however, less demanding activities such as walking and pivoting may induce pain as well as alterations in kinematics and joint stability. Still, the paucity of quantitative descriptions of cam FAIS has hindered understanding underlying hip joint mechanics during such activities. Previous in silico studies have employed generalized model geometry or kinematics to simulate impingement between the femur and acetabulum, which may not accurately capture the interplay between morphology and motion. In this study, we utilized models with participant-specific bone and articular soft tissue anatomy and kinematics measured by dual-fluoroscopy to compare hip contact mechanics of cam FAIS patients to controls during four activities of daily living (internal/external pivoting and level/incline walking). Averaged across the gait cycle during incline walking, patients displayed increased strain in the anterior joint (labrum strain: p-value~=~0.038, patients: 11.7~{\textpm}~6.7~\%, controls: 5.0~{\textpm}~3.6~\%; cartilage strain: p-value~=~0.029, patients: 9.1~{\textpm}~3.3~\%, controls: 4.2~{\textpm}~2.3). Patients also exhibited increased average anterior cartilage strains during external pivoting (p-value~=~0.039; patients: 13.0~{\textpm}~9.2~\%, controls: 3.9~{\textpm}~3.2~\%]). No significant differences between patient and control contact area and strain were found for level walking and internal pivoting. Our study provides new insights into the biomechanics of cam FAIS, including spatiotemporal hip joint contact mechanics during activities of daily living.},
