RECENT FINDINGS               Clinical diagnostic criteria for both Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies have been recently updated. These criteria result in overlap between individuals diagnosed with Parkinson disease and those with dementia with Lewy bodies. Although clinical features and symptomatic treatment overlap, differences remain in epidemiology and expected progression. The high prevalence of cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease supports regular screening for cognitive changes and counseling patients and families regarding what to expect. Treatment for Lewy body dementia involves avoiding medications that may cause or exacerbate symptoms; prescribing pharmacologic agents to address bothersome cognitive, behavioral, movement, and other nonmotor symptoms; recommending physical exercise and therapy; and providing education, counseling, caregiver support, and palliative care.                                         SUMMARY               Lewy body dementia includes both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia, overlapping clinicopathologic entities with differences relating to diagnosis and expected progression. Treatment is symptomatic and thus largely overlapping for the two conditions.},

This article contextualizes health disparities as they relate to the neurodegenerative processes of ADRD.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Older adults' life expectancy has increased such that a 65-year-old is expected to live 19 or more years and an 85-year-old can expect to live, on average, 6 to 7 years longer. Individuals of certain ethnoracial groups (Black, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) may be at a higher risk of incident ADRD compared to non-Hispanic/Latino White people. These differences in a higher risk of ADRD across ethnoracial groups persist despite no statistically significant differences in the rate of cognitive decline over time. The intersectionality of social determinants of health, experiences with discrimination and oppression, and access to care are related to the issue of justice and the risk for and expression of ADRD. The theoretical frameworks of various health disparities provide organized approaches to tracking the progression of health disparities for diverse patients.                                         SUMMARY               ADRD health disparities are complex. Neurologists and their care teams must consider the main reasons for clinical ADRD evaluations of members of ethnoracial groups and the factors that may impact patient adherence and compliance with diagnostic and management recommendations.},

A particular focus is on improving diagnostic accuracy to reduce the arduous diagnostic odyssey that so many patients and families endure. Strategies to promote diagnostic accuracy and approach the management of problematic symptoms are also discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although the International Consensus Criteria for bvFTD were published more than a decade ago and clinicopathologic studies have confirmed their utility, diagnostic confusion continues. This article presents updated data along with illustrative cases to emphasize the clinical pearls that are most useful for clinicians. Although accurate prediction of the underlying proteinopathy remains a challenge, the ability to differentiate bvFTD from atypical Alzheimer disease, psychiatric disorders, and other mimickers has improved. Knowledge about the genetic underpinnings in a significant minority of individuals with familial FTLD is enabling early and accurate diagnosis. Therapeutic optimism has also increased, particularly in familial FTLD, with a few clinical trials in progress and several more planned, some of which are designed to slow progression or delay the onset of symptoms, or both.                                         SUMMARY               The diagnosis and management of bvFTD is challenging for clinicians and particularly for patients and their families. Although much progress has been gained over recent years, several key research questions persist. Treatments that significantly improve symptoms or alter the course of FTLD remain elusive, but optimism is increasing as pathobiology is better understood and novel therapies are being developed.},

An outline of the history and controversy surrounding how these disorders are classified is provided before the article focuses on each disorder's clinical and imaging features.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Over the past decade, the classification of degenerative speech and language disorders has been refined. Clinical, imaging, and pathologic evidence suggests that primary progressive apraxia of speech is a distinct degenerative disorder. Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence have highlighted issues with nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA, which complicates the diagnosis, prognosis, and study of this disorder. Semantic variant PPA, while not without controversy, remains one of the most well-defined disorders, with good clinicopathologic correlation.                                         SUMMARY               Accurate classification and diagnosis of these degenerative speech and language disorders is crucial in clinical practice and ongoing research efforts. For nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA, the authors suggest emphasizing agrammatism as the core inclusion criterion and taking care not to include patients with isolated or predominant apraxia of speech. Isolated apraxia of speech can be the manifestation of a degenerative disease and, based on the different prognosis, should be recognized as distinct from PPA. Finally, it is important to recognize that some patients with semantic dementia, despite sharing the same pathologic associations, may not meet criteria for PPA.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Dementia clinical syndromes are frequently caused by mixed pathologies, leading to varied clinical presentations that include memory loss, behavioral changes, communication challenges, safety concerns, and loss of independent function. Medications for treating dementia currently target cognitive and behavioral symptoms, although disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease may be making their way into widespread clinical practice soon. Identification and treatment of co-occurring medical problems, such as obstructive sleep apnea, adverse medication effects, mood disorders, hearing loss, pain, alcohol misuse, and vascular risk factors, may mitigate the impact of these conditions on cognitive decline. Mobilization of clinical and community-based interprofessional teams will ensure that people with dementia and their care partners have the expertise, support, and access to resources they need. Addressing goals of care early in the disease course will allow people with dementia to contribute to their care plan by expressing their wishes.                                         SUMMARY               Developing a structured approach to treating common causes of dementia and related comorbid medical conditions, identifying a local network of interprofessional clinical and community-based referrals, and providing readily available educational resources will help clinicians provide quality dementia care management that extends beyond the clinic visit. Encouraging patients and families to engage in clinical research will advance the identification of effective therapies, preventive strategies, and quality care models for the future.},

Emphasis is placed on understanding the common underlying types of cerebrovascular disease (including atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy) and awareness of rare inherited cerebrovascular disorders.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The pathophysiology of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia is heterogeneous, and the most recent diagnostic criteria for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia break down the diagnosis of major vascular dementia into four phenotypic categories, including subcortical ischemic vascular dementia, poststroke dementia, multi-infarct dementia, and mixed dementia. Control of cardiovascular risk factors, including management of midlife blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugars, remains the mainstay of prevention for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy requires special consideration when it comes to risk factor management given the increased risk of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Recent trials suggest some improvement in global cognitive function in patients with vascular cognitive impairment and dementia with targeted cognitive rehabilitation.                                         SUMMARY               Thorough clinical evaluation and neuroimaging form the basis for diagnosis. As vascular cognitive impairment and dementia is the leading nondegenerative cause of dementia, identifying risk factors and optimizing their management is paramount. Once vascular brain injury has occurred, symptomatic management should be offered and secondary prevention pursued.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Substantial variability exists in the presenting features and clinical course of patients with common neurodegenerative causes of dementia, but the response to available therapies and eventual outcomes are often poor. This realization has influenced the evaluation of patients with dementia, with diagnostic approaches emphasizing routine screening for a short list of potentially modifiable disorders that may exacerbate dementia symptoms or severity but rarely influence long-term outcomes. Although a standard approach to the assessment of dementia is appropriate in the vast majority of cases, neurologists involved in the assessment of patients with dementia must recognize those rare patients with reversible causes of dementia, coordinate additional investigations when required, and ensure expedited access to treatments that may reverse decline and optimize long-term outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               The potential to improve the outcome of patients with reversible dementias exemplifies the need to recognize these patients in clinical practice.

RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive and motor syndromes are often intertwined in neurologic disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease, atypical parkinsonian syndromes, Huntington disease, and other movement disorders. Cognitive symptoms often affect attention, working memory, and executive and visuospatial functions preferentially, rather than language and memory, but heterogeneity can be seen in the various movement disorders. A distinct cognitive syndrome has been recognized in patients with cerebellar syndromes. Appropriate recognition and screening for cognitive changes in movement disorders may play a role in achieving accurate diagnoses and guiding patients and their families regarding progression and management decisions.                                         SUMMARY               In the comprehensive care of patients with movement disorders, recognition of cognitive syndromes is important. Pharmacologic treatments for the cognitive syndromes, including mild cognitive impairment and dementia, in these movement disorders lag behind the therapeutics available for motor symptoms, and more research is needed.

New studies have shed light on its epidemiology and pathogenesis and provided objective ways to measure outcome in patients with NPH. Neuroimaging has improved and allows better recognition of both NPH and the presence of overlapping diseases                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Several recent epidemiologic studies confirm that NPH is a rare disease, but the presence of large ventricles is a common finding with aging. NPH may be multifactorial, including congenital causes, vascular disease, and impaired CSF absorption. MRI features of NPH include enlarged ventricular size and CSF fluid collection outside the ventricles not due to atrophy. The term                 disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus                 (DESH) has been used to describe prognostic MRI features in NPH, including a ``tight high convexity'' and enlargement of CSF spaces in the sylvian fissure. DESH has been included in the Japanese guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of NPH. A new NPH scale has been published that provides an objective framework for evaluating patients with NPH before and after shunt placement. Programmable shunts can noninvasively manage overdrainage complications. Surgical outcome has been improving over time. Recent studies have led to improved recognition of overlapping diseases such as Alzheimer pathology, which co-occurs in about 30\% of NPH cases. Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a promising imaging modality for diagnosing NPH and detecting concomitant degenerative disease.                                                        SUMMARY               A systematic approach to patients with possible NPH allows recognition of the subset of patients who will respond to shunt surgery and identification of those with alternative diagnoses.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                A small proportion of AD is autosomal dominant familial AD caused by variants in                 PSEN1, PSEN2,                 or                 APP                 , although more recently described rare genetic changes can also increase risk substantially over the general population, with odds ratios estimated at 2 to 4.                 APOE                 remains the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, and understanding the biology of                 APOE                 has yielded mechanistic insights and leads for therapeutic interventions. Genome-wide studies enabled by rapidly developing technologic advances in sequencing have identified numerous risk factors that have a low impact on risk but are widely shared throughout the population and involve a repertoire of cell pathways, again shining light on potential paths to intervention. Population studies aimed at defining and stratifying genetic AD risk have been informative, although they are not yet widely applicable clinically because the studies were not performed in people with diverse ancestry and ethnicity and thus population-wide data are lacking.                                                        SUMMARY               The value of genetic information to practitioners in the clinic is distinct from information sought by researchers looking to identify novel therapeutic targets. It is possible to envision a future in which genetic stratification joins other biomarkers to facilitate therapeutic choices and inform prognosis. Genetics already has transformed our understanding of AD pathogenesis and will, no doubt, continue to reveal the complexity of brain biology in health and disease.},

Increased understanding of these pathologic entities is important for the neurologist who may encounter patients with an unusually slowly progressive degenerative dementia that may appear to meet criteria for Alzheimer disease but who progress to develop symptoms that are unusual for classic Alzheimer disease                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Hippocampal sclerosis has traditionally been associated with hypoxic/ischemic injury and poorly controlled epilepsy, but it is now recognized that hippocampal sclerosis may also be associated with a unique degenerative disease of aging or may be an associated pathologic finding in many cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Argyrophilic grain disease has been recognized as an enigma in the field of pathology for over 30 years, but recent discoveries suggest that it may overlap with other tau-related disorders within the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Primary age-related tauopathy has long been recognized as a distinct clinical entity that lies on the Alzheimer pathologic spectrum, with the presence of neurofibrillary tangles that lack the coexistent Alzheimer plaque development; thus, it is thought to represent a distinct pathologic entity.                                         SUMMARY               Despite advances in dementia diagnosis that suggest that we have identified and unlocked the mysteries of the major degenerative disease states responsible for cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly, diseases such as hippocampal sclerosis, argyrophilic grain disease, and primary age-related tauopathy demonstrate that we remain on the frontier of discovery and that our diagnostic repertoire of diseases responsible for such clinical symptoms remains in its infancy. Understanding such diagnostic confounds is important for the neurologist in assigning appropriate diagnoses and selecting appropriate therapeutic management strategies for patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in fluid (CSF and blood-based) and imaging biomarkers are allowing for a more precise and earlier diagnosis of AD (relative to non-AD dementias) across the disease spectrum and in patients with atypical clinical features. Specifically, tau- and amyloid-related AD pathologic changes can now be measured by CSF, plasma, and positron emission tomography (PET) with good precision. Additionally, a better understanding of risk factors for AD has highlighted the need for clinicians to address comorbidities to maximize prevention of cognitive decline in those at risk or to slow decline in patients who are symptomatic. Recent clinical trials of amyloid-lowering drugs have provided not only some optimism that amyloid reduction or prevention may be beneficial but also a recognition that addressing additional targets will be necessary for significant disease modification.                                         SUMMARY               Recent developments in fluid and imaging biomarkers have led to the improved understanding of AD as a chronic condition with a protracted presymptomatic phase followed by the clinical stage traditionally recognized by neurologists. As clinical trials of potential disease-modifying therapies continue, important developments in the understanding of the disease will improve clinical care now and lead to more effective therapies in the near future.},

While early-onset AD is often overshadowed by the more common late-onset AD, recognition of the differences between early- and late-onset AD is important for clinicians.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Early-onset AD comprises about 5\% to 6\% of cases of AD and includes a substantial percentage of phenotypic variants that differ from the usual amnestic presentation of typical AD. Characteristics of early-onset AD in comparison to late-onset AD include a larger genetic predisposition (familial mutations and summed polygenic risk), more aggressive course, more frequent delay in diagnosis, higher prevalence of traumatic brain injury, less memory impairment and greater involvement of other cognitive domains on presentation, and greater psychosocial difficulties. Neuroimaging features of early-onset AD in comparison to late-onset AD include greater frequency of hippocampal sparing and posterior neocortical atrophy, increased tau burden, and greater connectomic changes affecting frontoparietal networks rather than the default mode network.                                         SUMMARY               Early-onset AD differs substantially from late-onset AD, with different phenotypic presentations, greater genetic predisposition, and differences in neuropathologic burden and topography. Early-onset AD more often presents with nonamnestic phenotypic variants that spare the hippocampi and with greater tau burden in posterior neocortices. The early-onset AD phenotypic variants involve different neural networks than typical AD. The management of early-onset AD is similar to that of late-onset AD but with special emphasis on targeting specific cognitive areas and more age-appropriate psychosocial support and education.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Significant advances are being made in the recognition and characterization of the syndromically diverse AD variants. These variants are identified by the predominant cognitive and clinical features: early-onset amnestic syndrome, aphasia, visuospatial impairments, dysexecutive and behavioral disturbance, or motor symptoms. Although understanding of regional susceptibility to disease remains in its infancy, visualizing amyloid and tau pathology in vivo and CSF examination of amyloid-{$\beta$} and tau proteins are particularly useful in atypical AD, which can be otherwise prone to misdiagnosis.

This article describes the epidemiology, genetic and environmental risk factors, clinical diagnosis, biomarkers, and treatment of late-onset AD, defined by age of onset of 65 years or older.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with AD dementia, with the number of affected individuals growing rapidly because of an aging population. Vascular risk factors, sleep disorders, and traumatic brain injury are associated with an increased risk of AD, while increased cognitive and physical activity throughout the lifespan reduce the risk of disease. The primary genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the apolipoprotein E (                 APOE                 ) {$\varepsilon$}4 allele. AD typically presents with early and prominent episodic memory loss, although this clinical syndrome is neither sensitive nor specific for underlying AD neuropathology. Emerging CSF and imaging biomarkers can now detect the key neuropathologic features of the disease (amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration) in living people, allowing for characterization of patients based on biological measures. A comprehensive treatment plan for AD includes use of symptomatic medications, optimal treatment of comorbid conditions and neuropsychiatric symptoms, counseling about safety and future planning, and referrals to community resources.                                                        SUMMARY               AD is very common in older neurologic patients. Neurologists should set the standard for the diagnosis and care of patients with AD and should be familiar with emerging biomarkers that have transformed AD research and are primed to enter the clinical arena.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although the historical use of MRI in dementia diagnosis has been supportive to exclude structural etiologies, recent innovations allow for quantification of atrophy patterns that improve sensitivity for supporting the diagnosis of dementia causes. Neuronuclear approaches allow for localization of specific amyloid and tau neuropathology on PET and are available for clinical use, in addition to dopamine transporter scans in dementia with Lewy bodies and metabolic studies with fludeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET).                                         SUMMARY               Using computerized software programs for MRI analysis and cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluations of hippocampal, ventricular, and lobar volumes improves sensitivity in support of the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia. MRI protocol requirements for such quantification are three-dimensional T1-weighted volumetric imaging protocols, which may need to be specifically requested. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and 3.0T susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequences are useful for the detection of white matter hyperintensities as well as microhemorrhages in vascular dementia and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. PET studies for amyloid and/or tau pathology can add additional specificity to the diagnosis but currently remain largely inaccessible outside of research settings because of prohibitive cost constraints in most of the world. Dopamine transporter PET scans can help identify Lewy body dementia and are thus of potential clinical value.},

This article also discusses the underlying proteinopathies of neurodegenerative diseases (eg, amyloid-{$\beta$}, paired helical filament tau, {$\alpha$}-synuclein, and TDP-43 pathology) and vascular pathologies, including tissue injury (eg, infarcts, hemorrhages) with or without vessel disease.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                New criteria for AD pathologic diagnosis highlight amyloid-{$\beta$} as the                 sine qua non                 of AD; they require molecular markers of amyloid and establish a minimum threshold of Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage 3. Pathologic diagnosis is separated from clinical disease (ie, pathologic diagnosis no longer requires dementia). TDP-43 pathology, a major pathology in a frontotemporal dementia subtype, was found as a central pathology in LATE, a newly named amnestic disorder. Multiple pathologies (often co-occurring with AD) contribute to dementia and add complexity to the clinical picture. Conversely, Lewy body, LATE, and vascular dementias often have accompanying AD pathology. Pathology and biomarker studies highlight subclinical pathologies in older people without cognitive impairment.

These pathologies often co-occur (mixed pathologies), which may make specific clinical diagnoses difficult. In addition, dementia-related pathologies are often subclinical, suggesting varying levels of resilience in older people.},

RECENT FINDINGS               PCA is usually an atypical form of Alzheimer disease with relatively young age at onset. New diagnostic criteria allow patients to be diagnosed on a syndromic basis as having a primary visual (pure) form or more complex (plus) form of PCA and, when possible, on a disease-specific basis using biomarkers or underlying pathology. Imaging techniques have demonstrated that some pathologic processes are concordant (atrophy, hypometabolism, tau deposition) with clinical symptoms and some are discordant (widespread amyloid deposition). International efforts are under way to establish the genetic underpinnings of this typically sporadic form of Alzheimer disease. In the absence of specific disease-modifying therapies, a number of practical suggestions can be offered to patients and their families to facilitate reading and activities of daily living, promote independence, and improve quality of life                                         SUMMARY               While rare, PCA is an important diagnostic entity for neurologists, ophthalmologists, and optometrists to recognize to allow for early accurate diagnosis and appropriate patient management.

The clinician must distinguish a bvFTD syndrome from psychiatric illness and other neurodegenerative syndromes that feature a prominent behavioral component. Antemortem prediction of pathologic diagnosis remains imperfect but improves with careful attention to the clinical details. Management should emphasize prevention of caregiver distress, behavioral and environmental strategies, symptom-based psychopharmacology, and genetic counseling.                                         SUMMARY               BvFTD is an important and challenging dementia syndrome. Although disease-modifying treatments are lacking, clinicians can have a profound impact on a family coping with this disorder. Treatment trials are under way for some genetic forms of bvFTD. For sporadic disease, pathologic heterogeneity remains a major challenge, and ongoing research seeks to improve antemortem molecular diagnosis to facilitate therapeutic discovery.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The results of several large brain bank case series among subjects with a history of contact sports or repetitive head trauma have indicated that a high frequency of CTE may exist in this population. However, the true prevalence of CTE among individuals with a history of head trauma remains unknown, given that individuals who experienced cognitive, behavioral, and mood symptoms during life are more likely to have their brains donated for autopsy at death and epidemiologic studies of the condition are lacking. Neuropathologic consensus criteria have been published. Research-based clinical criteria have been proposed and are beginning to be applied, but the definitive diagnosis of CTE in a living patient remains impossible without effective biomarkers for the condition, which is an active area of study.                                         SUMMARY               The field of CTE research is rapidly growing and parallels many of the advances seen for other neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer disease decades ago.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article discusses the application of neuropsychological evaluation to the workup of individuals with age-related cognitive impairment and suspected dementia. Referral questions, principles of evaluation, and common instruments to detect abnormalities in cognition and behavior in this population are reviewed. The integration of neuropsychological test findings with other clinical and biomarker information enhances early detection, differential diagnosis, and care planning.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Life expectancy is increasing in the United States, and, accordingly, the prevalence and incidence of dementia associated with age-related neurodegenerative brain disease are rising. Age is the greatest risk factor for the dementia associated with Alzheimer disease, the most common neurodegenerative cause of dementia in people over 65 years of age; other etiologies, such as the class of frontotemporal lobar degenerations, are increasingly recognized in individuals both younger and older than 65 years of age. The clinical dementia diagnosis, unfortunately, is imperfectly related to disease etiology; however, probabilistic relationships can aid in diagnosis. Further, mounting evidence from postmortem brain autopsies points to multiple etiologies. The case examples in this article illustrate how the neuropsychological evaluation increases diagnostic accuracy and, most important, identifies salient cognitive and behavioral symptoms to target for nonpharmacologic intervention and caregiver education and support. Sharing the diagnosis with affected individuals is also discussed with reference to prognosis and severity of illness.                                         SUMMARY               The clinical neuropsychological examination facilitates early detection of dementia, characterizes the level of severity, defines salient clinical features, aids in differential diagnosis, and points to a pathway for care planning and disease education.},
