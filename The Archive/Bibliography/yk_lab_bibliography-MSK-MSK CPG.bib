  abstract = {Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged {$\geq$}18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45{$^\circ$} to one side and neck extended 20{$^\circ$} with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.},

The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to evaluate current best evidence associated with treatment. The scope of this guideline contains nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, including surgical procedures less invasive than knee arthroplasty. It does not provide recommendations for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis of other joints, or other imflammatory athropathies. This guideline contains 29 recommendations to assist all qualified and appropriately trained healthcare professionals involved in the nonarthroplasty management of osteoarthritis of the knee and provide information for patients. In addition, the work group highlighted the need for better research into intra-articular corticosteroid, hyaluronic acid, and platelet-rich plasma detailing osteoarthritis characterization, including subgroup analyses and osteoarthrosis severity stratification, and clinically relevant outcomes with control subjects for bias and cost-effectiveness analysis. Studies comparing outcomes in patients with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis and an MRI confirmed meniscal tear who have undergone partial meniscectomy after failing to improve with a course of conservative treatment (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid injection, and physical therapy) versus those who have undergone partial meniscectomy without a dedicated course of conservative treatment. Prospective randomized trials or prospective cohort studies are still needed to establish efficacy of individual oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs within specific subgroups and populations to tailor systemic medications to help increase efficacy and decrease the risk of adverse effects.},

  abstract = {Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) causing neurogenic claudication (NC) is increasingly common with an aging population and can be associated with significant symptoms and functional limitations. We developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on nonsurgical management of patients with LSS causing NC. Using the GRADE approach, a multidisciplinary guidelines panel based recommendations on evidence from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews published through June 2019, or expert consensus. The literature monitored up to October 2020. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, disability, quality of life, and walking capacity. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with LSS (congenital and/or acquired, lateral recess or central canal, with or without low back pain, with or without spondylolisthesis) causing NC. The guidelines panel developed 6 recommendations based on randomized controlled trials and 5 others based on professional consensus, summarized in 3 overarching recommendations: (Grade: statements are all conditional/weak recommendations)~Recommendation 1.~For patients with LSS causing NC, clinicians and patients may initially select multimodal care nonpharmacological therapies with education, advice and lifestyle changes, behavioral change techniques in conjunction with home exercise, manual therapy, and/or rehabilitation (moderate-quality evidence), traditional acupuncture on a trial basis (very low-quality evidence), and postoperative rehabilitation (supervised program of exercises and/or educational materials encouraging activity) with cognitive-behavioral therapy 12 weeks postsurgery (low-quality evidence).~Recommendation 2.~In patients LSS causing NC, clinicians and patients may consider a trial of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. (very low-quality evidence).~Recommendation 3.~For patients LSS causing NC, we recommend against the use of the following pharmacological therapies: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, methylcobalamin, calcitonin, paracetamol, opioids, muscle relaxants, pregabalin (consensus-based), gabapentin (very low-quality), and epidural steroidal injections (high-quality evidence). PERSPECTIVE: This guideline, on the basis of a systematic review of the evidence on the nonsurgical management of lumbar spine stenosis, provides recommendations developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Safe and effective non-surgical management of lumbar spine stenosis should be on the basis of a plan of care tailored to the individual and the type of treatment involved, and multimodal care is recommended in most situations.},

  abstract = {Upper limb amputation can result in significant functional impairment necessitating a comprehensive rehabilitation approach throughout the continuum of care. In 2022, the Departments of Veteran Affairs and Defense completed an updated clinical practice guideline for the management of upper limb amputation rehabilitation. This practice guideline was developed by a workgroup of subject-matter experts from a variety of disciplines. Twelve key questions were developed by the workgroup using the PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing of outcomes measurement, and setting) format to establish the scope of the literature review. Eighteen recommendations were developed through extensive review of the available literature and use of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. The strength of each recommendation was determined based on the quality of the research evidence and the additional domains of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. Of the 18 recommendations, 4 were found to have sufficient evidence to suggest for use of a particular rehabilitation management strategy. Thus, the 2022 Department of Veteran Affairs and Department of Defense clinical practice guideline provides updated, evidence-based information on the care and rehabilitation of persons with upper limb amputation. However, a significant lack of high-quality evidence in upper limb amputation rehabilitation limited evidence-based clinical guidance to assist healthcare providers in managing this population.},

Guidelines presenting recommendations on diagnosis and/or treatment of adult patients with LRP were included. Two independent reviewers selected eligible guidelines, evaluated quality with Appraisal of Guidelines Research \& Evaluation (AGREE) II, and extracted recommendations. Recommendations were classified into 'should do', 'could do', 'do not do', or 'uncertain'; their consistency was labelled as 'consistent', 'common', or 'inconsistent'. Twenty-three guidelines of varying quality (AGREE II overall assessment ranging from 17\% to 92\%) were included. Consistent recommendations regarding diagnosis are ('should do'): Straight leg raise (SLR) test, crossed SLR test, mapping pain distribution, gait assessment, congruence of signs and symptoms. Routine use of imaging is consistently not recommended. The following therapeutic options are consistently recommended ('should do'): educational care, physical activity, discectomy under specific circumstances (e.g., failure of conservative treatment). Referral to a specialist is recommended when conservative therapy fails or when steppage gait is present. These recommendations provide a clear overview of the management options in patients with LRP.},

A multidisciplinary workgroup of US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense amputation care subject matter experts was formed, and an extensive literature search was performed which identified 3685 citations published from January 2007 to July 2016. Articles were excluded based on established review criteria resulting in 74 studies being considered as evidence addressing one or more of the identified key issues. The identified literature was evaluated and graded using the National Academies of Science GRADE criteria. Recommendations were formulated after extensive review. Eighteen recommendations were confirmed with four having strong evidence and workgroup confidence in the recommendation. Key recommendations address patient and caregiver education, consideration for the use of rigid and semirigid dressings, consideration for the use of microprocessor knees, and managed lifetime care that includes annual transdisciplinary assessments. In conclusion, this clinical practice guideline used the best available evidence from the past 10 yrs to provide key management recommendations to enhance the quality and consistency of rehabilitation care for persons with lower limb amputation.},
