  abstract = {Purpose:               This study examines object permanence development in infants with motor delays (MD) compared with infants with typical development (TD) and in relation to sitting skill.                                         Methods:               Fifty-six infants with MD (mean age = 10 months) and 36 with TD (mean age = 5.7 months) were assessed at baseline and then at 1.5, 3, and 6 months postbaseline. A scale was developed to measure object permanence (Object Permanence Scale [OPS]), and the Gross Motor Function Measure sitting subsection (GMFM-SS), and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III) were administered.                                         Results:               Interrater reliability of the OPS was excellent and correlation between the OPS and Bayley-III cognitive scores was moderately positive. Compared with TD, infants with MD were delayed in development of object permanence but demonstrated increased understanding over time and as sitting skills improved.                                         Conclusion:               In children with MD, object permanence, as quantified by the OPS, emerges in conjunction with sitting skill.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calcaneal apophysitis, or Sever's disease, is the most common cause of heel pain in childhood and adolescence. It is regarded as an overuse syndrome. Studies on the incidence of calcaneal apophysitis in young athletes and their associated return-to-play time are lacking in the current literature. The aim of our current study was to identify the incidence of calcaneal apophysitis in professional youth soccer, the associated time to return-to-play, predisposing factors and their impact on time to return-to-play. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of injury data gathered from a German youth soccer academy in the years 2009-2018. In total, 4326 injury cases in 612 players were included in the study. The diagnosis and the follow-up visits were carried out in a weekly consultation hour at the youth academy. RESULTS: During the observation period of 10~years, 22 cases of calcaneal apophysitis were detected. The incidence of calcaneal apophysitis per 100 athletes per year was found to be 0.36. The mean age of the affected athletes at the time of diagnosis was 11.8\,{\textpm}\,2.1~years (MW\,{\textpm}\,SD). The complaints were unilateral in 20 and bilateral in two cases. Three of the 22 detected cases of calcaneal apophysitis (13.6\%) were recurrent injuries. The mean time to return-to-play of the affected athletes was 60.7\,{\textpm}\,64.9~days (MW\,{\textpm}\,SD). Athletes with recurrent complaints showed longer recovery time and time to return-to-play when compared to players with primary diagnosed disease. Our results could show that neither age nor body mass index at the time of diagnosis had an impact on time to return-to-play. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study investigating the incidence of calcaneal apophysitis and the associated time to return-to-play in youth elite soccer. Calcaneal apophysitis results in substantial time loss for the athletes. Further prospective clinical studies are required to fully understand the etiology and risk factors for calcaneal apophysitis and therefore develop preventive strategies.},

  abstract = {Sever's disease is an underreported prevalent pediatric condition that causes heel pain in children worldwide. It is often described as an overuse injury that can present with either unilateral or bilateral heel pain. Even though the exact mechanism of injury is unknown, it is often thought it involves repetitive stress and pressure on the calcaneal growth plate. Diagnosing Sever's disease mainly relies on a thorough clinical investigation and physical examination, with a positive squeeze test usually sufficient to establish diagnosis. Nevertheless, radiographic imaging can help exclude other differential diagnoses. Therapeutic options of Sever's disease are mostly conservative, and these include rest, physical therapy, kinesiotherapy, and orthoses. Educating parents and coaches on the symptomatology and presentation of Sever's disease is pivotal for the establishment of efficient preventive interventions and earlier diagnoses. This study presents a case of a pediatric patient with Sever's disease and offers medical insight into the diagnostic, clinical, pathologic, and therapeutic characteristics of this condition, in light of the current existing literature.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative rehabilitation is an important component of recovery after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR), facilitating successful return to sport (RTS) by reducing risk factors for repeat injury. PURPOSE: This systematic review aimed to determine the best protocol for RTS after ACLR in children. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science databases were searched from October 3, 2014, to November 3, 2022. The inclusion criteria were the pediatric population ({$<$}18 years old) after ACLR with clear RTS criteria and/or mean/median time to RTS. Multiligament knee injuries were excluded from this study. The methodologic quality of the included articles was assessed using the methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS). The highest possible score was 24 points for comparative studies (ie, a study comparing 2 protocols or more). Noncomparative studies or studies with a single protocol could score a maximum of 16 points as assessed by the MINORS score. RESULTS: The search yielded 1816 titles, and 24 were retained based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Every study was published between 2015 and 2022. Among the 24 studies included, 13 were retrospective and 11 were prospective. The mean MINORS score for the noncomparative studies was 13 of 16 (n = 23) and 23 of 24 for the comparative study (n = 1). The studies were categorized into unspecified clearance (n = 10), milestone based (n = 13), and combined time and milestone (n = 1). A total of 1978 patients (57\% female) were included in the review. The mean age at ACLR was 14.7 years. The most common endpoint used was graft rupture (0\% to 35\%). In the unspecified group, the quickest RTS was 5.8 months and the longest was 9.6 months. Statistically significant risk factors for ACL reinjury included younger age and earlier RTS. The latter was a significant contributor to graft failure for combined time-based and milestone-based RTS. In the milestone-based group, the most common criteria were {$\geq$}90\% limb symmetry measured using hamstring strength, quadriceps strength, and/or hop tests. The mean RTS time was 6.8 to 13.5 months. CONCLUSION: RTS should be delayed, when possible, especially in the younger population. A combination of quantitative tests and qualitative tests is also recommended. However, optimal RTS criteria have yet to be determined. Future prospective studies should focus on comparing the different times and milestones currently available.},

The progression is often indolent, laboratory results commonly fail to reveal an underlying infectious process and radiographs changes are seen after 7 days. We discuss the literature on the diagnosis and treatment of calcaneal osteomyelitis which can result in long-term sequelae in the pediatric patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 9-year-old white boy presented to our institution with heel pain and an inability to weight bear. There was a 10-day delay in diagnosis of calcaneal osteomyelitis, with a total of three presentations to our emergency department. The condition was misdiagnosed as Sever's disease on two separate occasions with discharge home. On his third presentation the diagnosis was finally clinched when he developed more definitive signs and symptoms, with pyrexia and signs of lymphangitis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse osteomyelitis of his calcaneum. He underwent surgery and 2 weeks of antibiotics administered intravenously, followed by 4 weeks of oral therapy. We are happy to report a good recovery without any complications at his 12-month follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should include calcaneal osteomyelitis as a differential in any child presenting with heel pain. Delays in the diagnosis can result in disastrous complications in the pediatric patient, such as growth arrest.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of Sever's injury (apophysitis calcanei) has previously been partly based on radiographic findings in the calcaneal apophysis. Sclerosis and fragmentation have been supposed to represent signs of inflammation due to tractions from the Achilles tendon. The clinical findings, diagnostic criteria, and studied population are often poorly defined. We sought to define diagnostic criteria by analyzing clinical and radiographic characteristics in a population with Sever's injury and to compare the findings with those of a control group of matched, symptom-free children. METHODS: We assessed 30 consecutive children with Sever's injury with high levels of pain but high physical activity levels in sports activities and 15 pain-free matched controls. RESULTS: One-leg heel standing showed 100\% sensitivity; the squeeze test, 97\%; and the palpation test, 80\%. All three tests showed 100\% specificity. All of the patients and controls showed increased density of the apophysis. Half of the pain-free controls showed fragmentation versus almost 90\% of children with heel pain. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of Sever's injury is clinical, not radiologic. Radiologic findings of increased density and fragmentation are found also in pain-free controls with high levels of physical activity and may, therefore, represent normal growth and development. We suggest that the diagnosis of Sever's injury should be based on patient history and the results of two specific clinical tests.},

  abstract = {Sever disease, or calcaneal apophysitis, is a common cause of heel pain in children or young athletes aged 8 to 15 with immature skeletons. Sever disease results from repetitive microtrauma to the secondary ossification center by traction of the Achilles tendon insertion on the calcaneus.~The condition frequently coincides with triceps surae shortening, which stems from the difference in growth rates between bone and muscle. Sever disease is common among children and adolescents who engage in sports that involve running and jumping. The pain occurs due to a sudden increase in sports activities, especially during a rapid growth spurt. However, the pain subsides with rest or when the activity is stopped.~Sever disease may also develop in less active adolescents who wear flat shoes. Patients affected by Sever disease usually report pain resolution during periods of rest or when the growth plate fully closes. Clinical examination demonstrates tenderness over the calcaneal insertion point of the Achilles tendon and a positive squeeze test involving manual medial and lateral compression of the posterior calcaneus.~The diagnosis of Sever disease is primarily clinical and does not necessitate imaging studies. However, plain radiographs can assist in ruling out bone fractures, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is valuable in differentiating Sever disease from infections and tumors.~ Sever disease typically follows a self-limited course, and its management involves activity modification or relative rest in response to pain. Symptom control incorporates the use of anti-inflammatory medications, ice, heel cups or heel lifts, and, in severe instances, immobilization.~A~rehabilitation regimen emphasizing heel cord stretching and strengthening should be integrated into the care plan to alleviate symptoms and address underlying biomechanical factors that may predispose the individual to the condition.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to understand the role of skeletal maturity in the different patterns of osteochondral and ligamentous injuries after an acute lateral patellar dislocation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two radiologists independently reviewed MRIs of 212 knees performed after an acute lateral patellar dislocation to evaluate the presence of high-grade patellar osteochondral injury, femoral osteochondral injury, and medial patellofemoral ligament injury. The association of skeletal maturity (indicated by a closed distal femoral physis), age, sex, and first-time versus recurrent dislocation with each of these various lesions was analyzed using Chi-square or T test, and multivariable logistic regression with estimation of odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: Skeletal maturity was significantly associated with high-grade patellar osteochondral injury [OR=2.72 (95\% CI 1.00, 7.36); p=0.049] and femoral-side MPFL tear [OR=2.34 (95\% CI 1.05, 5.25); p=0.039]. Skeletal immaturity was significantly associated with patellar-side MPFL tear [OR=0.35 (95\% CI 0.14, 0.90); p=0.029]. CONCLUSION: Patterns of injury to the patella and medial patellofemoral ligament vary notably between the skeletally immature and mature, and these variations may be explained by the inherent weakness of the patellar secondary physis.},
