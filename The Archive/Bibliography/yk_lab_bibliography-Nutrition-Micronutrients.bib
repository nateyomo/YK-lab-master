  abstract = {Physicians are frequently confronted with patients complaining of fatigue, tiredness and low energy levels. In the absence of underlying disease, these symptoms could be caused by a lack of vitamins and minerals. Certain risk groups like the elderly and pregnant women are well-recognized. Our aim was, therefore, to find out if other, less well-established groups might also be at risk. Thus, the objectives of this review are: to describe the inter-relationship between micronutrients, energy metabolism and well-being; identify risk groups for inadequate micronutrient intake; and explore the role of micronutrient supplementation in these groups. A review of the literature identified an important group at risk of inadequate micronutrient intake: young adults, often women, with a demanding lifestyle who are physically active and whose dietary behaviour is characterized by poor choices and/or regular dieting. Micronutrient supplementation can alleviate deficiencies, but supplements must be taken for an adequate period of time.},

  abstract = {Fe deficiency is a prevalent nutritional disease, and fatigue is a common complaint in the general and patient population. The association between Fe deficiency without anaemia (IDNA) and fatigue is unclear. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Fe on fatigue in patients with IDNA and the association between IDNA and fatigue in the population. Articles from the PubMed database up to 19 January 2016 were systematically searched. A total of six relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT) and six relevant cross-sectional studies were identified. All outcomes were converted into effect sizes. In the meta-analysis of the six RCT, we identified a significant therapeutic effect of Fe in fatigue patients with IDNA (pooled effect size 0{$\cdot$}33; 95 \% CI 0{$\cdot$}17, 0{$\cdot$}48; I 2=0{$\cdot$}0 \%; P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). A sensitivity analysis found that the overall results (i.e. significant association) were robust. In the meta-analysis of the six cross-sectional studies, the association between IDNA and fatigue was not significant (pooled effect size 0{$\cdot$}10; 95 \% CI -0{$\cdot$}11, 0{$\cdot$}31; I 2=57{$\cdot$}4 \%; P=0{$\cdot$}362). A sensitivity analysis found that the overall results (i.e. no significant association) were not robust; removal of one study made the outcomes significant. These meta-analyses suggest that improving Fe status may decrease fatigue. Further research is necessary to identify diagnostic criteria for selecting fatigue patients who might benefit from Fe therapy and to assess the prevalence of IDNA with fatigue in the general population.},
