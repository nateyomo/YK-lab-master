  abstract = {QUESTION: What is the effect of injury prevention programs that include balance training exercises on the incidence of ankle injuries among soccer players? DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised trials with meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Soccer players of any age, sex or competition level. INTERVENTIONS: The experimental intervention was an injury prevention program that included balance training exercises. The control intervention was the soccer team's usual warm-up program. OUTCOME MEASURES: Exposure-based ankle injury rates. RESULTS: Nine articles met the inclusion criteria. The pooled results of injury prevention programs that included balance training exercises among 4,959 soccer players showed a 36\% reduction in ankle injury per 1,000 hours of exposure compared to the control group with an injury risk ratio (IRR) of 0.64 (95\% CI 0.54 to 0.77). The pooled results of the F{\'e}d{\'e}ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) injury prevention programs caused a 37\% reduction in ankle injury (IRR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.48 to 0.84) and balance-training exercises alone cause a 42\% reduction in ankle injury (IRR 0.58, 95\% CI 0.41 to 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates that balance exercises alone or as part of an injury prevention program decrease the risk of ankle injuries. PROSPERO CRD42017054450.},

  abstract = {Lower body and core muscular strength are essential for optimal performance in many sports and competitive surfers have similar strength demands when maneuvering a surfboard to achieve competition success. Presently, the use of unstable surfaces is excessively utilized by surf coaches and trainers and to date, research does not support this as an effective training method for long-term improvements. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an 8-week Core Strength Training Program (CSTP) on a battery of field tests specific to assessing core musculature and lower body strength for junior competitive surf athletes. Nineteen American junior competitive surf athletes (age:15.7{\textpm}1.01yrs, height:1.77{\textpm}0.007m, mass:64.67{\textpm}9.08kg) completed pre- and post-tests with a transitional pre-season to in-season 8-week CSTP intervention. The battery of tests included: rotational power (RP), time to peak acceleration (TP), maximal acceleration (Ma), maximal countermovement jump (CMJ), estimated peak power (PP), core strength (CS), core endurance (CE), and rotational flexibility (RF). Means, standard deviations, RMANOVA with a significance level of p {$<$} 0.05, and effect sizes were computed. Results demonstrated significant improvements in L.RP, TP, CMJ, PP, CS, and RF. Based on the results, the CSTP is an effective training program for surf coaches and strength and conditioning professionals to improve strength in the core musculature and lower body. In addition, we conclude implementation of the CSTP enhances athletic performance measurements which will likely increase competition success.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Combat sports are typically divided into weight classes, and body-mass manipulation to reach a weight class is commonplace. Previous research suggests that weight loss practices in mixed martial arts (MMA) may be more extreme than in other combat sports. PURPOSE: To investigate the magnitude of weight loss and the prevalence of weight loss strategies in different combat sports. METHODS: Competitors (N\,=\,637) from Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, judo, MMA, Muay Thai/kickboxing, taekwondo, and wrestling completed an online questionnaire seeking information regarding their weight loss practices. RESULTS: Body-mass manipulation was commonly undertaken by all combat-sport athletes, with a particularly high incidence of gradual dieting, increased exercise, and fluid restriction. Skipping meals was higher in taekwondo and wrestling (84\%) compared with the other combat sports ({$\sim$}58\%), whereas training in heated rooms and forced oral fluid loss (spitting) was higher in wrestling (83\% and 47\%, respectively) compared with other combat sports ({$\sim$}45\% and {$\sim$}19\%, respectively). MMA athletes reported the highest usage of sauna (76\%) and water loading (67\%) while also reporting the second-highest use of training in rubber/plastic suits (63\%). CONCLUSIONS: Body-mass manipulation was present in all combat sports, with the prevalence and magnitude of acute weight loss greater in MMA. The incidence of and practices reported will help support staff be fully aware of the variety of methods these athletes and coaches may use to achieve weight loss. Additionally, the results could aid regulatory bodies in the further development of policies on weight cutting.},

Keywords related to biomechanics and golf swings were used in scientific databases. Only articles that focused on golf-swing kinematics were considered. In this review, 92 articles were considered and categorized into the following domains: X-factor, crunch factor, swing plane and clubhead trajectory, kinematic sequence, and joint angular kinematics. The main subjects of focus were male golfers. Performance parameters were searched for, but the lack of methodological consensus prevented generalization of the results and led to contradictory results. Currently, three-dimensional approaches are commonly used for joint angular kinematic investigations. However, recommendations by the International Society of Biomechanics are rarely considered.},

We present a systematic review of the existing literature describing biomechanical adaptations in the dominant shoulders of volleyball players and factors that may predispose to shoulder pain/injury. A thorough literature search via Medline, EMBASE and SCOPUS was conducted for original studies of volleyball players and 15 eligible articles were identified. Assessment of study quality was performed using the STROBE statement. The reviewed literature supports the existence of a glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) and a possible (and less pronounced) external rotation gain in the dominant vs. the non-dominant shoulder of volleyball athletes. Unlike other overhead sports, the GIRD in volleyball athletes appears to be anatomical as a response to the repetitive overhead movements and not to be associated with shoulder pain/injury. Additionally, the dominant shoulder exhibits muscular imbalance, which appears to be a significant risk factor for shoulder pain. Strengthening of the external rotators should be used alongside shoulder stretching and joint mobilisations, core strengthening and optimisation of spike technique as part of injury management and prevention programmes.},

This study aimed to determine whether dry sauna therapy improved the quality of life of obese people. METHODS: A total of 38 consecutive participants aged over 20 years with a body mass index of {$\geq$}25 kg/m2 were recruited for the study. The participants were treated with a 90{$^\circ$}C dry sauna for 15 minutes, twice daily for 4 consecutive days. To assess the quality of life, all participants completed the 5 level EQ-5D questionnaires and the EQ-Visual Analog Scale. Study parameters were measured on the same day prior to commencing the sauna sessions in a fasted state and 2 days after the last sauna session. RESULTS: The average age was 62.3{\textpm}9.5 years; 84.2\% of the participants were female. The mean body mass index was 28.5{\textpm}2.4 kg/m2. Dry sauna significantly improved the mean 5 level EQ-5D index scores from 0.83{\textpm}0.12 to 0.89{\textpm}0.11 and increased the mean EQ-Visual Analog Scale from 79.0{\textpm}15.2 to 91.1{\textpm}9.7. However, there were no significant changes in body mass index, blood pressure, heart rate, or body composition before and after the 8-session sauna therapy. CONCLUSION: Dry sauna improved the health-related quality of life of obese patients without adverse events. Further clinical studies in larger study populations are needed to verify these findings and provide concrete evidence for obesity treatment.},

To alleviate fatigue (physical and mental), mindfulness and music have been proposed. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of mindfulness-based mental versus music training on mental fatigue, physical fatigue, and recovery in elite competitive female volleyball athletes using a randomized two-controlled study with follow-up. Participants were 30 elite female Brazilian volleyball athletes. Athletes were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) mindfulness-based mental training group (MBMT); 2) music-based training group (MBT); or 3) control group (CG). Three variables were evaluated as follows: 1) recovery based on total quality recovery; 2) mental fatigue visual analog scale; and 3) physical fatigue visual analog scale. Regarding recovery, there was no difference between the MBMT, MBT, and CG groups (p {$>$} 0.05). A difference in mental fatigue was noted between MBT and CG at follow-up [F(2,26) = 5.71, p = 0.009; large]. Regarding physical fatigue, there was no difference between the MBMT, MBT, and CG groups (p {$>$} 0.05). The mindfulness intervention effectively attenuated the mental fatigue caused by competition in volleyball athletes. These results will assist coaches and staff in providing fatigue management and reinforce the applicability of mental training in sports.},

Maximal strength training improves surfboard sprint and endurance paddling performance in competitive and recreational surfers. J Strength Cond Res 31(1): 244-253, 2017-Upper-body (UB) strength has very high correlations with faster surfboard paddling speeds. However, there is no research examining the effects of improving UB strength has on surfboard paddling ability. This study aimed to determine the influence that improvements in UB closed-kinetic chain maximal strength have on surfboard paddling in both competitive and recreational surfers. Seventeen competitive and recreational male surfers (29.7 {\textpm} 7.7 years, 177.4 {\textpm} 7.4 cm, 76.7 {\textpm} 9.9 kg) participated in a repeated-measures, parallel control study design. Anthropometry; 5-, 10-, and 15-m sprint; and 400-m endurance surfboard paddling tests along with pull-up and dip 1 repetition maximum strength tests were assessed pre- and postintervention. Subjects in the training group performed 5 weeks of maximal strength training in the pull-up and dip. Differences between the training and control groups were examined postintervention. The training group increased their speed over the 5-, 10-, and 15-m sprint, whereas the control group became slower (d = 0.71, 0.51, and 0.4, respectively). The training group also displayed faster endurance paddling performance compared with the control group (d = 0.72). Short-term exposure to maximal strength training elicits improvements in paddling performance measures. However, the magnitude of performance increases seems to be dependent on initial strength levels with differential responses between strong and weaker athletes. Although a longer maximal strength training period may have produced more significant paddling improvements in stronger subjects, practitioners are unlikely to have any more than 5 weeks in an uninterrupted block with competitive surfing athletes. This study reveals that a "threshold" level of maximal strength that if possessed, short-term maximal strength training may only provide little improvement in paddling performance.},

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Nine databases searched in August 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any injury prevention programme (eg, exercise, education, braces) were included. Study inclusion criteria were: {$\geq$}20 female football players in each study arm (any age, football code or participation level) and injury incidence reporting. RESULTS: Twelve studies, all in soccer, met inclusion criteria, with nine involving adolescent teams (aged {$<$}18 years). All studies (except one) had a high risk of bias. Eleven studies examined exercise-based programmes, with most (9/11) including multiple ({$\geq$}2) training components (eg, strength, plyometric, balance exercises). Multicomponent exercise programmes reduced overall (any reported) injuries (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.73, 95\%\,CI 0.59 to 0.91) and ACL injuries (IRR 0.55, 95\%\,CI 0.32 to 0.92). For exercise-based strategies (single-component and multicomponent), hamstring injuries were also reduced (IRR 0.40, 95\%\,CI 0.17 to 0.95). While exercise-based strategies resulted in less knee, ankle and hip/groin injuries, and the use of multiple training components was associated with greater reductions in overall and knee injuries, further studies would be required to increase the precision of these results. The incidence of overall injuries in women's football was 3.4 per 1000 exposure hours; with ankle injuries most common. CONCLUSION: In women's football, there is low-level evidence that multicomponent, exercise-based programmes reduce overall and ACL injuries by 27\% and 45\%, respectively.

When managing hip symptoms in this cohort, orthopaedic surgeons should consider the unique factors associated with ballet, including ballet-specific movements, morphologic adaptations of the hip, and the culture of the sport. Three common etiologies of hip pain in ballet dancers include femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, hip instability, and extra-articular snapping hip syndrome.

  abstract = {Ballet dancers may be predisposed to hip injuries because of the unique demands placed on the hips during dance training and performance. Hip arthroscopy can be used to address several of these symptomatic disorders, including hip instability and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS). After hip arthroscopy, ballet dancers undergo a rehabilitation program to allow for healing, range of motion restoration, and progressive strengthening. Once patients complete the standard postoperative therapy program, a paucity of information is available to guide dancers back to the advanced hip movements involved in ballet. Therefore, the purpose of this clinical commentary is to present a stepwise rehabilitation protocol with return to ballet progression for dancers undergoing hip arthroscopy for instability or FAIS. Particular emphasis is placed on movement-specific exercises for ballet performers, and objective clinical metrics, to guide return to dance progression.},

Rehabilitation programs have drastically changed, especially in the terminal phases of rehabilitation, which include performance enhancement, development of power, and a safe return to activity. Plyometric exercise has become an integral component of late phase rehabilitation as the patient nears return to activity. Among the numerous types of available exercises, plyometrics assist in the development of power, a foundation from which the athlete can refine the skills of their sport. Therefore, the purpose of this clinical commentary is to provide an overview of plyometrics including: definition, phases, the physiological, mechanical and neurophysiological basis of plyometrics, and to describe clinical guidelines and contraindications for implementing plyometric programs.},

J Strength Cond Res 33(2): 502-513, 2019-The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of daily cold water immersion (CWI) on physical performance, muscle damage, and inflammatory, hormonal, and oxidative stress markers in volleyball. Six players were submitted to CWI and six players to a placebo, during 5 training days. Thigh circumference, squat jump, and agility were measured on the first, third, and sixth days. On the first and sixth days, blood and saliva were collected for analysis of oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inflammatory and hormonal levels. Muscle soreness and countermovement jump were quantified daily. The physical performance comparisons did not present differences and the only between group comparison with a large effect size (ES = -1.39) was in {$\Delta\%$} between day 1 and day 2 for countermovement jump. Delayed onset muscle soreness and creatine kinase increased in both groups and the ESs of between group comparisons of {$\Delta\%$} between moments were not more than moderate. Thigh circumference increased only in the placebo group (p = 0.04) and the ES of the between group comparisons of {$\Delta\%$} between moments was large (1.53). No differences were found in oxidative stress, or inflammatory markers. Cortisol decreased only in the CWI-group (p {$\leq$} 0.05) and the ESs of the between group comparisons of {$\Delta\%$} between moments of the testosterone to cortisol ratio (-1.94) and insulin-like growth-1 (-1.34) were large. Despite the positive effects of daily CWI on muscle edema and hormonal status, the limited effects of CWI on performance, muscle damage, inflammation markers, and reactive oxygen species mediators signal the unimportance of the daily practice of this recovery method in volleyball players.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interval throwing programs are used in rehabilitation of throwing injuries, especially ulnar collateral ligament injuries. Athletes who are rehabilitating begin by throwing on flat ground progressing through increasing distances, number of throws, and intensity of throwing. If the athlete is a baseball pitcher, the flat-ground throwing phase is followed by pitching on a mound at progressively increased effort. The goal is to build back arm strength and capacity with an emphasis on proper mechanics. PURPOSE: To determine whether interval throwing progressively builds joint kinetics (specifically, elbow varus torque) to the level required during full-effort baseball pitching. A secondary purpose was to examine the kinematics produced during interval throwing compared to those seen during baseball pitching. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Review. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and Google Scholar were systematically searched for biomechanical studies of flat-ground throwing and partial-effort pitching in baseball between 1987 and 2023. Studies that reported the biomechanics of either flat-ground throwing, or partial-effort pitching were included in this review. The AXIS tool was used to assess study quality. RESULTS: Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Ten studies were determined to be of moderate quality, while three studies were deemed high quality. Elbow varus torque during partial-effort pitching was less than during full-effort pitching. Elbow varus torque for most flat-ground throws did not exceed full-effort pitching torque. While most studies showed increased elbow varus torque with increased flat-ground throwing distance, the distance at which elbow varus torque matched or exceeded full-effort pitching elbow varus torque was not consistent.As flat-ground throwing distance increased, shoulder external rotation angle and shoulder internal rotation velocity increased. Arm slot (forearm angle above horizontal) decreased as flat-ground throwing distance increased. For varied effort pitching, shoulder external rotation angle, shoulder internal rotation velocity, elbow extension velocity, and ball velocity increased as effort increased. While the front knee extended slightly from foot contact to ball release in full-effort pitching, the front knee flexed slightly during partial-effort pitching. CONCLUSIONS: An interval throwing program progressively builds elbow varus torque up to levels produced in full-effort baseball pitching. While differences exist between interval throwing kinematics and pitching kinematics, the patterns are similar in general. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Improper baseball pitching biomechanics are associated with increased stresses on the throwing elbow and shoulder as well as an increased risk of injury. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Previous studies quantifying pitching kinematics and kinetics were reviewed. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5. RESULTS: At the instant of lead foot contact, the elbow should be flexed approximately 90{$^\circ$} with the shoulder at about 90{$^\circ$} abduction, 20{$^\circ$} horizontal abduction, and 45{$^\circ$} external rotation. The stride length should be about 85\% of the pitcher's height with the lead foot in a slightly closed position. The pelvis should be rotated slightly open toward home plate with the upper torso in line with the pitching direction. Improper shoulder external rotation at foot contact is associated with increased elbow and shoulder torques and forces and may be corrected by changing the stride length and/or arm path. From foot contact to maximum shoulder external rotation to ball release, the pitcher should demonstrate a kinematic chain of lead knee extension, pelvis rotation, upper trunk rotation, elbow extension, and shoulder internal rotation. The lead knee should be flexed about 45{$^\circ$} at foot contact and 30{$^\circ$} at ball release. Corrective strategies for insufficient knee extension may involve technical issues (stride length, lead foot position, lead foot orientation) and/or strength and conditioning of the lower body. Improper pelvis and upper trunk rotation often indicate the need for core strength and flexibility. Maximum shoulder external rotation should be about 170{$^\circ$}. Insufficient external rotation leads to low shoulder internal rotation velocity and low ball velocity. Deviation from 90{$^\circ$} abduction decreases the ability to achieve maximum external rotation, increases elbow torque, and decreases the dynamic stability in the glenohumeral joint. CONCLUSION: Improved pitching biomechanics can increase performance and reduce risk of injury. SORT: Level C.},

Acute injuries tend to affect the lower extremity; chronic injuries usually involve the upper extremity. Commonly encountered upper extremity conditions include rotator cuff injury, internal impingement, superior labral tears, and epicondylitis of the elbow. Serving is the most strenuous stroke in tennis, with the highest peak muscle activity in the shoulder and forearm occurring during this stroke. The kinetic chain links upper extremity, lower extremity, and core muscle segments by transmitting coordinated activation and motion; in this regard, any pathologic process that disturbs the groin, hip, and abdominal musculature can further result in an increased risk of injury to the shoulder and upper extremity. Evolution in equipment and in play surfaces has also affected the type and frequency of injuries. Prevention programs that address the muscular imbalances throughout the kinetic chain may help reduce the incidence of both acute and chronic injuries experienced by tennis athletes.},

A secondary objective of this study is to further compare the physical capacities and abilities that may differentiate between the competitive levels of surfing. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: Twelve junior-elite (currently competing at a state level or higher and 12-18 years of age), twelve senior-elite (currently competing at a national level and/or the World Qualifying Series and over 16 years of age), and twelve recreational surfers (minimum of two years surfing experience; actively surfing at least once a week and over 18 years of age) were recruited for this study. All participants completed a pre-exercise medical questionnaire, anthropometric assessment, ankle dorsiflexion range of motion assessment, medial-lateral ankle proprioception assessment, countermovement jump, squat jump, isometric mid-thigh pull and drop-and-stick. RESULTS: Senior-elite surfers had large and significantly better ankle proprioception and range of motion than junior-elite and recreational surfers. However, the relationship between years of surf-specific experience and ankle proprioception was small and non-significant. Better drop-and-stick performance, indicated by lower relative peak force, was present in the senior-elite compared to the junior-elite and recreational groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that medial-lateral ankle proprioception is a distinguishing characteristic of senior-elite surfers and therefore, may be a critical ability for competitive success. Greater ankle range of motion and the ability to attenuate energy to reduce landing force may be developed through long-term training commensurate with competitive surfing.},

Relationship between the type of surfing practiced and the onset of pain is not fully understood as well as the potential role of rehabilitation in preventing it. OBJECTIVE: To investigate musculoskeletal pain and to deepen whether the age and the anatomical region involved influenced the pain appearance in relation to four surfing disciplines. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out. An online survey was addressed to a group of Italian surfers (practicing surf, kitesurf, windsurf and stand up paddle since at least 1 year), collecting demographic data, discipline practiced, location of musculoskeletal pain. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six surfers were involved in the study. Spine and upper limbs pain was more frequent compared to lower limbs one in the surf (p{$<$} 0.001) and in the windsurf groups (p= 0.007). In the kitesurf group a greater prevalence of pain was observed in spine and lower limbs compared to upper limbs (p= 0.017). Low back pain is the most represented among the spine pain subgroups (p{$<$} 0.001). Pain was lower in younger athletes (p= 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding risk factors and biomechanics of musculoskeletal pain is essential to realize prevention training strategies. Rehabilitation in sinergy with specific training allows pain-free activity, optimizing its overall health benefits.},

Twenty-four competitive adolescent surfers (19 male, 5 female; age = 14.4 {\textpm} 1.3 years, mass: 50.1 {\textpm} 10.7 kg, and stature: 159.9 {\textpm} 10.3 cm) were assigned to perform either 5 weeks of SIT and HIT. Participants completed a repeated-sprint paddle ability test (RSPT, 15-m surfboard sprint paddle initiated every 40 seconds {\texttimes} 10 bouts) and 400-m endurance surfboard paddle time trial before and after training. High-intensity interval training decreased the total time to complete the 400 m by 15.8 {\textpm} 16.1 seconds (p = 0.03), and SIT decreased the total time to complete the RSPT by 6.5 {\textpm} 4.3 seconds (p = 0.02). Fatigue index during the RSPT (first-slowest effort) was lower after HIT and SIT (p {$\leq$} 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively). There were no significant differences in performance changes in the 400 m (total time) and RSPT (total time, fastest 15 m time, and peak velocity) between HIT and SIT. Our study indicates that HIT and SIT may be implemented to the training program of surfers to improve aerobic and repeat-sprint paddle ability, both of which are identified as key aspects of the sport. In addition, these findings indicate that 400-m paddle and RSPT can discriminate between aerobic and anaerobic training adaptations, with aerobic gains likely from HIT and anaerobic gains from SIT.},

J Strength Cond Res 31(1): 260-271, 2017-Despite the increased professionalism and substantial growth of surfing worldwide, there is limited information available to practitioners and coaches in terms of key performance analytics that are common in other field-based sports. Indeed, research analyzing surfing performance is limited to a few studies examining male surfers' heart rates, surfing activities through time-motion analysis (TMA) using video recordings and Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) data during competition and recreational surfing. These studies have indicated that specific activities undertaken during surfing are unique with a variety of activities (i.e., paddling, resting, wave riding, breath holding, and recovery of surfboard in the surf). Furthermore, environmental and wave conditions also seem to influence the physical demands of competition surfing. It is due to these demands that surfers are required to have a high cardiorespiratory fitness, high muscular endurance, and considerable strength and anaerobic power, particular within the upper torso. By exploring various methods of performance analysis used within other sports, it is possible to improve our understanding of surfing demands. In so doing this will assist in the development of protocols and strategies to assess physiological characteristics of surfers, monitor athlete performance, improve training prescription, and identify talent. Therefore, this review explores the current literature to provide insights into methodological protocols, delimitations of research into athlete analysis and an overview of surfing dynamics. Specifically, this review will describe and review the use of TMA, GPS, and other technologies (i.e., HR) that are used in external and internal load monitoring as they pertain to surfing.},

J Strength Cond Res 32(10): 2939-2948, 2018-The study provides an in-depth descriptive and quantitative time-motion analysis of competitive surfing, using Global Positioning System (GPS) units and video synchronization, which serves to extend upon the results of Farley, Harris, and Kilding (Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 26, 7 [2012]). In addition, comparisons between locations and surfers competing in the same heats were performed. Global Positioning System and video data were collected from 41 male competitive surfers (23.2 {\textpm} 6.1 years, 71 {\textpm} 10.3 kg, 177.2 {\textpm} 6.4 cm) participating in 3 professional domestic surfing events, with competitive heats of 20-minute duration. Fifty data sets were analyzed across the 3 competitions, with velocities and distances covered, proportion of time spent performing various surfing activities, and total work-to-relief ratio determined. Results revealed surfers paddled 44\% of the total time, followed by stationary periods (42\%). Surfers performed at a significantly (p {$\leq$} 0.05) higher work-to-relief ratio (1.7:1) at the beach-break (an exposed beach) compared with point-break 1 and 2 (waves breaking around a rocky point). Point-breaks 1 and 2 had longer continuous durations of paddling, with significantly longer rides at point-break 1 over the beach-break (p {$\leq$} 0.01) and point-break 2 (p {$\leq$} 0.01). The average maximal speed (24.8 km{$\cdot$}h) from point-break 2 was significantly faster than point-break 1 (p {$\leq$} 0.01) and beach-break (p {$\leq$} 0.05).

Comparison of anthropometry and lower limb power qualities according to different levels and ranking position of competitive surfers. J Strength Cond Res 31(8): 2231-2237, 2017-The aim of this study was to compare competitive surfers' lower limb power output depending on their competitive level, and to evaluate the association between competition rankings. Twenty competitive surfers were divided according to the competitive level as follows: international (INT) or national (NAT), and competitive ranking (RANK1-50 or RANK51-100). Vertical jump and maximal peak power of the lower limbs were measured. No differences were found between INT and NAT surfers in the anthropometric variables, in the vertical jump, or in lower extremity power; although the NAT group had higher levels on the elasticity index, squat jumps (SJs), and counter movement jumps (CMJs) compared with the INT group. The RANK1-50 group had a lower biceps skinfold (p {$<$} 0.01), lower skinfolds in the legs (Front thigh: p {$\leq$} 0.05; medial calf: p {$<$} 0.01), lower sum of skinfolds (p {$\leq$} 0.05), higher SJ (p {$<$} 0.01), CMJ (p {$<$} 0.01), and 15 seconds vertical CMJ (p {$\leq$} 0.05); also, maximal peak power of the right leg (MPPR) and left leg (MPPL) were higher in the RANK1-50 group. Moderate to large significant correlations were obtained between the surfers' ranking position and some skinfolds, the sum of skinfolds, and vertical jump. Results demonstrate that surfers' physical performance seems to be an accurate indicator of ranking positioning, also revealing that vertical jump capacity and anthropometric variables play an important role in their competitive performance, which may be important when considering their power training.},

Performance of two aerial variations (Frontside Air (FA) and Frontside Air Reverse (FAR)) was also measured, with variables relating to technical performance (critical feature and subjective ratings) and potential injury risk (relative total peak landing force and loading rates) collected. Multiple linear regressions were used to predict performance of both aerial variations based on a subset of independent variables. Four models could predict performance. Predicted technical capability in the FAR was mostly influenced by lead limb hip extension and lead limb knee flexion range of motion. Potential injury risk when surfers perform an FA and FAR was predicted to be mitigated by increasing lead ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, as well as trail hip extensor mobility to reduce the relative total peak force experienced when landing the FA. These simple outcome measures could be routinely assessed to ensure successful and safe aerial landings in surfing.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(10): 3003-3011, 2020-To successfully and safely perform surfing maneuvers, surfers and their coaches need to know how to perform each maneuver correctly. Although some components of the sport are well understood, evidence-based recommendations in the scientific literature on how to perform surfing skills are sparse. The aim of this article was to systematically review the body of literature pertaining to discrete wave-riding skills and characteristics that are associated with the ability of surfers to successfully perform them. Searches of PubMed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus with Full-text, and Web of Science were undertaken in January 2019, to identify the most appropriate literature, with secondary searches of reference lists used to create a greater pool of possible articles. The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Ten studies deemed appropriate for review captured data from 299 surfers, who were predominantly competitive (78.3\%) and male (58.2\%). The average Down and Black Quality Index of the articles was 76.3 {\textpm} 8.4\%, with these articles focusing on the "pop-up" and landing skills. Performance indicators, such as isometric push-up peak forces, force-plate derived and in-water time to pop-up, relative peak forces generated when landing and time-to-stabilization, were all shown to be related to the physical characteristics of surfers and could affect the ability of surfers to successfully ride a wave. Findings from the studies included in this review suggest that the pop-up and landing exhibit trainable qualities that coaches and athletes can use to improve surfing performance.},

Fifteen competitive surfers (age 20.3~{\textpm}~5.6~years, height 178.2~{\textpm}~9.16 cm, mass 71.0~{\textpm}~10.5 kg) performed a Frontside Air (FA) and Frontside Air Reverse (FAR), while we collected the impact forces, ankle and knee muscle activity, and kinematic data. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce 41 dependent variables into 10 components. A two-way MANOVA revealed that although there were no limb x aerial variation interactions, surfers generated significantly higher relative loading rates at landing for the trail limb compared to the lead limb (+28.8 BW/s; F(1,303)~=~20.660, p {$<~$}0.0001, {$\eta$}2~=~0.064). This was likely due to the surfers "slapping" the trail limb down when landing, rather than controlling placement of the limb. Similarly, higher relative loading rates were generated when landing the FA compared to the FAR (+23.6 BW/s; F(1,303)~=~31.655, p {$<~$}0.0001, {$\eta$}2~=~0.095), due to less time over which the forces could be dissipated. No relationships between aerial variation or limb were found for any of the kinematic or muscle activity data. Practitioners should consider the higher relative loading rates generated by a surfer's trail limb and when surfers perform a FA when designing dry-land training to improve the aerial performance of surfing athletes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Physical preparation of competitive surfers includes substantial dry-land training. It is currently unknown, however, how closely these exercises replicate surfing maneuvers performed in the ocean. This study compared the technique features displayed by surfers when landing simulated aerial maneuvers on land to critical features previously established as necessary for surfers to successfully land aerials in the ocean during competition. METHODS: Fourteen competitive surfers (age 20.6~{\textpm}~5.7~years, height 178.1~{\textpm}~9.50~cm, mass 70.6~{\textpm}~10.8~kg) were recruited to perform two variations of a simulated aerial task, a Frontside Air (FA) and Frontside Air Reverse (FAR). Joint ranges of motion (ROM), center of pressure, and apparent gaze data were collected during the landing event. Paired t tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to identify any significant differences in the outcome variables between the two aerial tasks. RESULTS: Participants displayed 100\% and 60\% of the critical features associated with successfully landing a FA and FAR, respectively. In both the simulated FA and FAR, participants landed in 1.0-3.7{$^\circ$} of dorsiflexion, moving through significantly less ankle joint ROM in the lead limb during the FAR (P~{$<~$}.01). Participants also displayed significantly less knee and hip ROM (P~=~.002-.048) while landing the FAR compared to the FA. CONCLUSION: The simulated FA and FAR tasks are appropriate training tools for surfers to replicate most of the critical features that a surfer should display to successfully land aerial maneuvers in the ocean. These tasks therefore enable surfers to practice these complex movements in a controlled environment.},

Four different surfboard fins, including conventional, single-grooved, and double-grooved fins, were developed using computer-aided design combined with additive manufacturing (3D printing). We systematically installed these 3D-printed fins into instrumented surfboards, which six accomplished surfers rode on waves in the ocean in a random order while blinded to the fin condition. We quantified the surfers' wave-riding performance during each surfing bout using a sport-specific tracking device embedded in each instrumented surfboard. After each fin condition, the surfers rated their perceptions of the Drive, Feel, Hold, Speed, Stiffness, and Turnability they experienced while performing turns using a visual analogue scale. Relationships between the surfer's perceptions of the fins and their surfing performance data collected from the tracking devices were then examined. The results revealed that participants preferred the single-grooved fins for Speed and Feel, followed by double-grooved fins, commercially available fins, and conventional fins without grooves. Crucially, the surfers' perceptions of their performance matched the objective data from the embedded sensors. Our findings demonstrate that accomplished surfers can perceive how changes to surfboard fins influence their surfing performance.},

METHODS: Medical literature was queried for all reports of this condition, systematically abstracted, and analyzed. An illustrative case that provides the most definitive support for a vascular cause is presented. Treatment considerations based on prior cases and expert opinions are provided. RESULTS: Sixty-four cases of surfer's myelopathy have been reported to date. This atraumatic thoracic/conus medullaris myelopathy with only a 42\% neurological recovery rate almost uniformly affects young, healthy, novice surfers who have no pre-existent spinal disease. Symptoms usually start with back pain and rapidly progress to complete or incomplete myelopathy. T2 magnetic resonance images show increased signal in the central spinal cord within 24 to 72 hours. Gadolinium enhancement and diffusion-weighted imaging are not helpful. Angiography has been underused. Angiogram in our case showed the absence of a right T12 radicular artery and no artery of Adamkiewicz, which, along with clinical findings, support the vascular origin theory. Incomplete cases often improve within 24 hours of onset, whereas no improvement has been reported for American Spinal Injury Association class A cases. Several acute interventions have been tried. Steroids are most common, and patients receiving steroids improved 55\% of the time with no reported adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Surfer's myelopathy is a clinical entity associated with complete deficit in {$>$}50\% of cases. Its prognosis is almost exclusively dictated by severity at presentation/nadir. Thus, publicizing this rare but serious condition (within and outside the medical literature) may be an effective intervention.},

We hypothesized that wave direction and surf stance interact in creating favourable or debilitative performance demands as surfers are either facing the wave (frontside) or the wave is breaking in the back of the surfers (backside). Study 1 was an online survey collecting self-report data of recreational surfers (n\,=\,394). In Study 2, we analysed all wave scores (n\,=\,2,552) and laterality of professional surfers during the season of 2014. Study 1 demonstrated that recreational surfers preferred surfing frontside and described themselves as more skilful when surfing frontside as this is facilitative for picking up visual information. Study 2 did not provide clear evidence that professional surfers on average scored higher during contests when surfing frontside, but when professional surfers had a choice of surfing frontside vs. backside, they were more likely to surf frontside. We discuss the diverging findings between Study 1 and Study 2 from the "circumvention-of-limits" argumentation within the expertise literature as professional surfers most likely have acquired skills allowing them to compensate for debilitative individual and environmental circumstances.},

DESIGN: The design included clinical measurement, reliability and validity. METHODS: Thirty shoulders (mean age = 26.8 years) without pathology were evaluated. Measurements were taken in supine and prone with both an inclinometer and HALO{\copyright} device. RESULTS: Active ER ROM in prone was significantly higher than in supine when using both devices. Intra-rater reliability (within and between session) intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values ranged between 0.82-0.99 for both devices in supine and prone. An ICC test revealed a significant (p {$<$} 0.01) correlation for both devices in IR and ER movements (ICC3,1 = 0.87 and ICC3,1 = 0.72), respectively. CONCLUSION: This study has shown prone assessment of active ER and IR ROM to be a reliable and appropriate method for prone dominant athletes (swimmers and surfers).

CONCLUSION: This study has illustrated reliable methods to assess the thoracic spine in the sagittal plane and thoracic rotation. It has also quantified ROM in a surfing cohort; identifying thoracic rotation as a key movement.

V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak was significantly greater in competitive surfers than in recreational surfers (M = 40.71 {\textpm} 3.28 vs. 31.25 {\textpm} 6.31 ml{$\cdot$}kg{$\cdot$}min, p {$<$} 0.001). This was also paralleled for anaerobic power (M = 303.93 vs. 264.58 W) for competitive surfers. Arm span and lean total muscle mass was significantly (p {$\leq$} 0.01) correlated with key performance variables (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and anaerobic power). No significant (p {$\geq$} 0.05) correlations were revealed between season rank and each of the variables of interest (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and anaerobic power). Key performance variables (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and anaerobic power) are significantly higher in competitive surfers, indicating that this is both an adaptation and requirement in this cohort. This battery of physiological tests could be used as a screening tool to identify an athlete's weaknesses or strengths. Coaches and clinicians could then select appropriate training regimes to address weaknesses.},

  abstract = {Context: Surfer's myelopathy (SM) is an acute syndrome identified by nontraumatic paraparesis or paraplegia. Though traditionally tied to first-time surfers, the condition encompasses any activity involving hyperextension of the back such as gymnastics, yoga, and Pilates.Methods: MEDLINE{\textregistered} and Google Scholar literature searches were gathered to identify relevant case reports for determining the etiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of SM.Results: While the rare nature of SM limits its full understanding, studies have pinpointed that hyperextension in the back leads to vasculature insufficiency secondary to dynamic compression of the artery of Adamkiewicz. In surfing, this hyperextension combined with the execution of the Valsalva maneuver while trying to stand up on the surfboard likely increases intraspinal pressure. Due to its nontraumatic origin, the presence of SM is not immediately clear. Moreover, its similarity in clinical and radiological presentations with other entities can further complicate diagnosis. Seemingly, idiopathic urological symptoms can be explained by the physician if they conduct a thorough history.Conclusion: In an effort to raise awareness for the practicing physician, we presently review the etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prolonged effects of SM. With the surging popularity of surfing as well as the advent of children participating in precarious sports and activities at an earlier age, we can expect a rising incidence of traumatic and nontraumatic spinal cord injuries. Neurologists, urologists, emergency medicine and sports medicine physicians alike can utilize this review to build a high index of suspicion for SM. The risk factors for SM should be conveyed to those participating in novices in surfing, yoga, gymnastics, ballet, and any activity enabling sustained or repeated spinal extension. Increased general awareness will facilitate increased symptom recognition in order to arrest aggravation of injury.},

  abstract = {In the last decades, indoor volleyball has experienced significant rule changes and a high player specialization in both sexes. Different spike attack arm swing techniques have developed which might affect performance and risk of injury. While a variety of arm swing techniques was already shown in world class beach volleyball players, it is unclear if this is also true for world class indoor volleyball. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the spike attack arm swing techniques of Olympic volleyball winners and finalists (1984-2021) and to investigate possible differences between sex, playing position, scoring system, and compared to beach volleyball. Eighty-two male (M) and 85 female (F) players were assessed from video recordings from ten competitions. Five different arm swing techniques in the cocking phase (Straight, Bow-and-arrow high, Bow-and-arrow low, Snap, Circular) were classified by two experts. The most frequent technique for both sexes was the Circular (M = 40.2\%; F = 38.8\%), followed by Snap (M = 28.0\%; F = 23.5\%), Bow-and-arrow low (M = 20.7\%; F = 21.2\%), Bow-and-arrow high (M = 7.3\% F = 11.8\%), and Straight (M = 3.7\%; F = 4.7\%). Bow-and-arrow high and Straight techniques were significantly less used than other techniques in both sexes. There were no significant differences (p \&gt; 0.05) in arm swing techniques between sexes, playing positions, and scoring system but significant differences (p \&lt; 0.001) to beach volleyball. Although most volleyball textbooks only describe the Bow-and-arrow techniques, most of the world class indoor volleyball players used Circular and Snap arm swing techniques. Reasons for that could be the implicit knowledge of players (and coaches) regarding increased performance (ball speed) and injury prevention. Based on these results we suggest to critically revise arm swing technique training especially for young players and players with shoulder problems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Literature regarding surfing injuries is scarce and most studies report a high number of minor injuries. Recent literature suggests that musculoskeletal injuries are more common than previously reported. In the mid 2000s, competitive surfing has seen an increase in aerial maneuvers, as they have become more highly rewarded by the judging panel, which may be contributing to a change in injury patterns. Our goal was to evaluate orthopedic injuries in professional surfers. HYPOTHESIS: Orthopedic injuries in professional surfers are diverse and have evolved with skill and technology. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4 Case Series. METHODS: Medical records of professional surfers from a single orthopedic center between 1991 and 2016 were reviewed. Injuries sustained while surfing and chronic injuries related to surfing were included. Site of injury, diagnosis, and treatment were recorded along with demographic data. RESULTS: In total, 163 injuries in 86 athletes were recorded. The median injury age was 28.5 years (range 12-62 years) and 92.6\% of patients were male. The most frequently injured body parts were the knee (28.2\%), ankle (22.1\%), and shoulder (19\%). Most knee injuries were of the medial collateral ligament at 49\%, with 75\% of ankle injuries being sprains, and in shoulder, 48\% had instability, 42\% had a rotator cuff tear, and 35\% had a superior anterior-posterior labral tear. Lower extremity injuries primarily affected the surfers' back leg (72.5\%). In all, 34.6\% of all injuries required surgical intervention and involved shoulder injuries most the time. CONCLUSIONS: The most common orthopedic injuries in professional surfers involve the knee, ankle, shoulder, hip, and back. Surfers' rear extremities were preferentially injured which is the extremity responsible for power and torque. Shoulder injuries increased the probability of an operative intervention. Last, overuse injuries (femoral-acetabular impingement, rotator cuffs) occurred in the older surf population compared with more acute injuries (ankle sprains/fractures, anterior cruciate ligament tears) which is also consistent with time to surgery.},

Not only is chronic respiratory disease a leading cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality, but the COVID-19 pandemic has~heightened attention on respiratory health and the means of enhancing it. Subsequently, and inevitably, the respiratory system has become a target of the multi-trillion-dollar health and wellness industry. Numerous commercial, respiratory-related interventions are now coupled to therapeutic and/or ergogenic claims that vary in their plausibility: from the reasonable to the absurd. Moreover, legitimate and illegitimate claims are often conflated in a wellness space that lacks regulation. The abundance of interventions, the range of potential therapeutic targets in the respiratory system, and the wealth of research that varies in quality, all confound the ability for health and exercise professionals to make informed risk-to-benefit assessments with their patients and clients. This review focuses on numerous commercial interventions that purport to improve respiratory health, including nasal dilators, nasal breathing, and systematized breathing interventions (such as pursed-lips breathing), respiratory muscle training, canned oxygen, nutritional supplements, and inhaled L-menthol. For each intervention we describe the premise, examine the plausibility, and systematically contrast commercial claims against the published literature. The overarching aim is to assist health and exercise professionals to distinguish science from pseudoscience and make pragmatic and safe risk-to-benefit decisions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a combat sport underpinned by techniques from other combat disciplines, in addition to strategies unique to the sport itself. These sports can be divided into two distinct categories (grappling or striking) based on differing technical demands. Uniquely, MMA combines both methods of combat and therefore appears to be physiologically complex requiring a spectrum of mechanical and metabolic qualities to drive performance. However, little is known about the physiological characteristics that distinguish higher- from lower-level MMA athletes. Such information provides guidance for training interventions, performance testing and talent identification. Furthermore, while MMA incorporates techniques from both grappling and striking sports, it is unknown precisely how these disciplines differ physiologically. Understanding the relationship between higher-level competitors in grappling and striking combat sports can provide further insight into the development of the optimal performance profile of a higher-level MMA athlete. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to analyse the scientific literature on MMA and the primary combat sports underpinning it to determine the physiological adaptations that distinguish superior competitors, with a view to defining the optimal physiological profile for higher-level MMA performance. Furthermore, this article will explore the differences in these capabilities between grappling- and striking-based combat sports in the context of MMA. METHODS: A literature search was undertaken via PubMed, Web of Science, SportDiscus and Google Scholar. The following sports were included for systematic review based on their relevance to MMA: mixed martial arts, boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, judo, karate, kickboxing, Muay Thai and wrestling. The inclusion criteria allowed studies that compared athletes of differing competition levels in the same sport using a physiological performance measure. Only male, adult (aged 17-40~years), able-bodied competitors were included. The search history spanned from the earliest record until September 2015. RESULTS: Of the eight combat sports searched for, five were represented across 23 studies. Sixteen investigations described maximal strength or neuromuscular power variables, while 19 articles reported anaerobic or aerobic measures. The results indicate that a number of strength, neuromuscular power and anaerobic variables distinguished higher- from lower-level combat sport athletes. However, these differences were less clear when groups were stratified within, rather than between competition grades. Greater aerobic power was generally not present amongst superior combat sport competitors. CONCLUSION: There appear to be differing physiological profiles between more successful grappling and striking combat sport athletes. This is represented by high-force demands of grappling sports causing an upwards shift of the entire force-velocity relationship driven by an increase in maximal strength. In comparison, smaller increases in maximal force production with more notable enhancements in lighter load, higher velocity actions may better identify superior performance in striking sports. Anaerobic capabilities largely distinguished higher- from lower-level combat sport athletes. In particular, longer-term anaerobic efforts seem to define successful grappling-based athletes, while superior competitors in striking sports tend to show dominance in shorter-term measures when compared with their lower-level counterparts. Given the demand for both forms of combat in MMA, a spectrum of physiological markers may characterize higher-level competitors. Furthermore, the performance profile of successful MMA athletes may differ based on combat sport history or competition strategy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations in glenohumeral internal rotation (GIR), glenohumeral external rotation (GER), and the total arc of motion (TAM) have been linked with increased injury risk in the shoulder and elbow. These motions have been routinely measured with the forearm in neutral rotation (GIRN, GERN, TAMN). GER capacity appears to be especially important. The throwing motion, however, requires forearm pronation as GER occurs to achieve optimal cocking (GERP). No previous studies have evaluated GERP to determine GER capacity or pronated TAM (TAMP) values. HYPOTHESIS: There would be significant differences between GERN and TAMN and between GERP and TAMP. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3. METHODS: Sixty asymptomatic male Minor League Baseball players (32 pitchers, 28 position players) participated in the study and were tested on the first day of spring training. Passive range of motion measurements were recorded using a long-arm bubble goniometer for GIRN, GERN, and GERP on both arms. TAM was calculated separately as the sum of internal and external rotational measurements under neutral and pronated conditions. RESULTS: Within pitchers and position players, all measurements were statistically reduced for the throwing arm (P {$\leq$} 0.03) except for GERN of the pitchers. GERP measures were significantly less than GERN for both arms of each group (P {$<$} 0.01): pitchers throwing arm +11.8{$^\circ$}/nonthrowing arm +4.8{$^\circ$}, position players throwing arm = +8.6{$^\circ$}/nonthrowing arm +4.0{$^\circ$}. CONCLUSION: The forearm position of pronation, which appears to be mediated by tightness of the biceps, decreases GER capacity and TAM. GER and TAM should be calculated in neutral and pronated positions, considering that 80\% of the players have a demonstrated difference between 8{$^\circ$} and 12{$^\circ$}. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Measurement of GERP more accurately reflects the GER required in throwing, allows better quantification of the motion capacity necessary to withstand the loads in throwing, and may suggest interventions for at risk athletes.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Some methods such as ergo nutritional aids, cooling or massage among others could improve recovery in combat sports (CS). The effects, doses, duration, and timing of these methods remains unknown. Nowadays, there is no clear consensus regarding the recovery strategies and it is necessary to understand the type of fatigue induced in CS and its underlying mechanisms. The main aim of this article is to review the update literature related to recovery strategies in CS. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search was conducted following preferred reporting items for review statement on the topic of: "combat sports," "recovery," "nutrition," "fatigue," "ergogenic aids," "weight cutting" and "hydration." EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The initial search of the literature detected 369 articles about CS. Later, 307 were excluded after being determined unrelated to recovery or after failure to fulfill the inclusion criteria. Of the 80 included articles, 19 satisfied the final inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: To optimize CS performance, adequate recovery is required during training and competition processes. Traditional ergo nutritional supplementation of carbohydrates and proteins combined. Besides, the consumption of evidence supported supplementation (green tea, beetroot gels, creatine or alkaline water) improve recovery processes. Further methods of recovery including physical (cold water immersion, massage or photobiomodulation) and physiological (types of active recovery, sleep and rest) therapies have also been shown useful. This narrative review elucidates the important role of recovery techniques in CS.},

Eleven competitive surfing athletes aged 24~{\textpm}~7~years participated, and inertial motion sensors were fixed to the anterior aspect of the feet, mid-tibial shafts, sacrum and eighth thoracic vertebrae on these athletes. Three tasks were performed landing on force plates and two tasks in a modified gymnastics set-up used for land-based aerial training. Peak landing force, resultant peak acceleration and front and rear side ankle dorsiflexion ranges of motion during landing were determined. The peak acceleration was approximately 50\% higher when performing aerial training using a mini-trampoline and landing on a soft-density foam board, compared to a similar landing off a 50~cm box. Furthermore, the ankle ranges of motion during the gymnastic type landings were significantly lower than the other landing types (P~{$\leq~$}0.05 and P~{$\leq~$}0.001), for front and rear sides, respectively. Conclusively, increased task complexity and specificity of the sport increased the tibial peak acceleration, indicating greater training load.},

However, the relationships among energy flow during the tennis serve, ball velocity, and overuse injuries have not been assessed. PURPOSE: To investigate the relationships among the quality and magnitude of energy flow, the ball velocity, and the peaks of upper limb joint kinetics and to compare the energy flow during the serve between injured and noninjured tennis players. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The serves of expert tennis players were recorded with an optoelectronic motion capture system. The forces and torques of the upper limb joints were calculated from the motion captures by use of inverse dynamics. The amount of mechanical energy generated, absorbed, and transferred was determined by use of a joint power analysis. Then the players were followed during 2 seasons to identify upper limb overuse injuries with a questionnaire. Finally, players were classified into 2 groups according to the questionnaire results: injured or noninjured. RESULTS: Ball velocity increased and upper limb joint kinetics decreased with the quality of energy flow from the trunk to the hand + racket segment. Injured players showed a lower quality of energy flow through the upper limb kinetic chain, a lower ball velocity, and higher rates of energy absorbed by the shoulder and elbow compared with noninjured players. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study imply that improper energy flow during the tennis serve can decrease ball velocity, increase upper limb joint kinetics, and thus increase overuse injuries of the upper limb joints.},

Serves of eight male advanced tennis players were recorded with a motion capture system before, at mid-match, and after a 3-hour tennis match. Before and after each match, electromyographic data of 8 upper limb muscles obtained during isometric maximal voluntary contraction were compared to determine the presence of muscular fatigue. Vertical ground reaction forces, rating of perceived exertion, ball speed, and ball impact height were measured. Kinematic and upper limb kinetic variables were computed. The results show decrease in mean power frequency values for several upper limb muscles that is an indicator of local muscular fatigue. Decreases in serve ball speed, ball impact height, maximal angular velocities and an increase in rating of perceived exertion were also observed between the beginning and the end of the match. With fatigue, the majority of the upper limb joint kinetics decreases at the end of the match. No change in timing of maximal angular velocities was observed between the beginning and the end of the match. A prolonged tennis match play may induce fatigue in upper limb muscles, which decrease performance and cause changes in serve maximal angular velocities and joint kinetics. The consistency in timing of maximal angular velocities suggests that advanced tennis players are able to maintain the temporal pattern of their serve technique, in spite of the muscular fatigue development.},

  abstract = {Prospective and retrospective studies have examined traumatic injuries within competitive and recreational surfers worldwide using online surveys and health care facility (HCF; e.g., hospital, emergency department, medical record) data. However, few studies have provided a synthesis of all available literature. The purpose of this study was to obtain, critique and synthesise all literature specific to acute surfing injuries, and evaluate differences in injury type, mechanism and location between HCF and survey data. A systematic literature review design was used to identify relevant articles from three major databases. Peer-reviewed epidemiological studies of musculoskeletal surfing injuries were included. A modified AXIS tool was used for critical appraisal, and objective data was extracted and synthesized by lead researchers. Overall frequencies for injury location, type and mechanism were calculated from raw injury data. A total of 19 cross-sectional articles of fair to good quality (Modified AXIS 54.2-83.3\%) were included in this study; 17 were National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) level III-2 (retrospective) and two were level II (prospective). Articles examined competitive, recreational and combined populations. Injury data from Australia, Brazil, UK, USA, Portugal, Japan, Norway, and worldwide were represented. Skin (46.0\%; HCF 50.1\%, survey 43.8\%) and being struck by own surfboard (38.6\%; HCF 73.4\%, survey 36.7\%) were the most common injury type and mechanism. Head, face and neck injuries were most common in HCF (43.1\%) versus lower limb injuries (36.4\%) in survey data. Incidence proportion was highest in aerialists (0.48). Incidence rate (number of injuries per 1000 h) ranged from 0.74 in Australian surfers (Melbourne) to 6.6 in international contest surfers from medical record data. This review highlights the prevalence of skin, board-related, head, face and neck, and lower limb surfing injuries across available literature. Proposed use of protective equipment and foam-based surfboards in dangerous or crowded surf locations may reduce injury risk.},

  abstract = {Golf is one of a few activities that people of all ages and skill level can play. Injury as with all sports can occur. The low back is the most common injury sustained whilst playing golf, and the dynamic action of the golf swing is a major contributing factor to injury. The golf swing is a complex movement that utilises the whole body in a coordinated fashion and when repeated frequently can result in injury. Injury can be overuse or traumatic in nature. Overuse injuries predominate in the professional golfer, and amateur golfer injury tends to occur secondary to an incorrect golf swing. Upper limb injuries are also common due to their role in linking the fast moving golf club with the power-generating torso. Fortunately, injury from a club or ball strike is rare. More common are the overuse injuries associated with the back, neck and shoulder. Most golf injury data have been collected retrospectively and further epidemiological study of a prospective nature is required to determine injury incidence and factor relating to the onset of injury.},

  abstract = {This study compared determinants of a 30-s all-out paddling effort (30-s sprint-paddling test) between junior surfboard riders (surfers) of varying ability. Eight competitive (COMP) and 8 recreational (REC) junior male surfers performed a 30-s sprint-paddling test for the determination of peak sprint power and accumulated O2 deficit. Surfers also performed an incremental-paddling test for the determination of the O2 uptake-power output relationship that was subsequently used to calculate the accumulated O2 deficit for the 30-s sprint-paddling test. During the 30-s sprint-paddling test, peak sprint power (404 {\textpm} 98 vs 292 {\textpm} 56 W, respectively, P = .01) and the accumulated O2 deficit (1.60 {\textpm} 0.31 vs 1.14 {\textpm} 0.38 L, respectively, P = .02) were greater in COMP than in REC surfers, whereas peak O2 uptake measured during the incremental-paddling test was not different (2.7 {\textpm} 0.1 vs 2.5 {\textpm} 0.2 L/min, respectively, P = .11). The higher peak sprint power and larger accumulated O2 deficit observed in COMP than in REC surfers during a 30-s sprint paddling test suggest that surfing promotes development of the anaerobic energy systems. Furthermore, peak sprint power determined during 30 s of sprint paddling may be considered a sensitive measure of surfing ability or experience in junior male surfers.},

  abstract = {Surfing has rapidly grown in popularity as the sport made its debut at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Surfing injuries are becoming more relevant with the globalisation and increasing risks of the sport, but despite this, little is known about surfing injuries or prevention strategies in either the competitive or recreational surfer. Prior research demonstrates that surfers are injured at a frequency of 0.74-1.79 injuries per 1000 hours of surfing. We reviewed the literature for the incidence, anatomical distribution, type and underlying mechanism of acute and overuse injuries, and discuss current preventative measures. This review finds that skin injuries represent the highest proportion of total injuries. Acute injuries most frequently affect the head, neck and face, followed by the lower limbs. Being struck by one's own board is the most common mechanism of injury. Non-contact acute ligament injuries have increased as surfing manoeuvres have become more acrobatic and overuse musculoskeletal injuries are highly correlated with paddling. However, there is a paucity of research for surfing injuries, and studies on overuse musculoskeletal injuries and prevention are disproportionally under-represented. Most of the prior studies are limited by small sample sizes, poor data collection methodology and geographical constraints. Further research is needed to establish preventative measures for both acute and overuse surfing injuries and to ensure the increasing popularity of surfing is met with an improved understanding of sport risks and safety. Specifically, we recommend research be prioritised regarding the efficacy of training programmes to prevent surfing-related overuse musculoskeletal injuries.},

This study evaluated surfers' activity times at the Portuguese surfing championship in order to account for the time spent in each surfing activity. METHODS: Eighty-seven individually recorded videos of surfers were analyzed, showing their activity over the entire heat, and video analysis software was used to obtain each surfer's activity profile in the competition. RESULTS: The results breakdown by time percentage show that the surfers were paddling 50.9\% of the time, sprint paddling for wave 1.9\%, were stationary 34.1\% of the time, wave riding 3.7\%, and involved in miscellaneous activities (e.g., duck diving, board recovery, etc.) 9.4\% of the total time. Average times spent in each surfing activity were 18.6 seconds for paddling, 2.9 seconds for sprint paddling for a wave, 21.7 seconds for the stationary period, 11.5 seconds for wave riding, and 6.9 seconds for miscellaneous activities. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed that the most performed heat activity was paddling, allowing us to conclude that surfing is basically a long-arm paddling activity and that this activity constitutes a specific surfing competition demand, which in turn means that individual surfer's data can be used as a starting point for the development of tailored conditioning training programs.},

Hence, coaches and athletes have recognised the importance of physical preparation to enhance athletic performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a sport-specific, land-based-home exercise programme (LB-HEP) on sport-specific assessments related to surfing performance in recreational surfers. Twenty-two year-round recreational surfers divided into two groups: the exercise group (EG) performed the LB-HEP 3 times a week for 8\,weeks while the control group (CG) maintained their current exercise. Both groups were instructed to continue surfing during the study period. Each surfer completed sport-specific measurements related to surfing demands both pre-test and post-test (8\,weeks). There was a significant interactive effect of time and group (p\,=\,.009, {$\eta$}p2 =.298) on the surfer's performance questionnaire showing greater improvements in the EG. Additionally, the EG had an improvement on time to pop-up when compared to the CG ({$\eta$}p2 =.160). Based on the results, the LB-HEP is an effective training programme for all experience levels of recreational surfers to improve surfing performance measures short term.},

Furthermore, the study aimed to compare pop-up performance between stronger and weaker surfers. Eighteen female (n = 9) and male (n = 9) surfers (age = 28.1 {\textpm} 6.4 years, mass = 69.6 {\textpm} 10.4 kg, and height = 172.5 {\textpm} 6.7 cm) completed a battery of upper-body strength assessments, of which exhibited high between-day reliability: IPU, (coefficient of variation [CV\%] = 4.7, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96), DPU (CV\% = 5.0, ICC = 0.90), and FP POP (CV\% = 4.4, ICC = 0.90). Participants were subsequently split into stronger (n = 9) and weaker (n = 9) surfers based on normalized peak force (PF) attained in the IPU. Pop-up performance was measured both in the water and during the FP POP and was referred to as time to pop-up (TTP). Significant between-group differences were observed for normalized PF during IPU (d = 1.59, p {$<$} 0.01) and DPU (d = 0.94 p = 0.04). Although not significant, there was a large magnitude difference in FP POP (d = 0.80, p = 0.08) and FP TTP (d = 0.85, p = 0.07). Significant correlations were identified between normalized IPU PF and normalized DPU FP (r = 0.69, p = 0.03) and FP TTP (r = 0.73, p = 0.02) in the stronger group. The weaker group exhibited a significant inverse correlation between normalized IPU PF and in-water TTP (r = -0.77, p {$<$} 0.01). The results suggest improvements in pop-up performance may be elicited by improving dynamic strength for stronger surfers, whereas pop-up performance in weaker surfers may be elicited by improving maximum strength. The upper-body strength assessments provided a novel insight into strength qualities that are associated with in-water performance of surfers (TTP).},

However, little has been reported on surfing-related injuries and, to date, no study has utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize injury patterns. OBJECTIVE: To use MRI to perform a descriptive analysis of surfing injuries in patients who presented to an urban tertiary care musculoskeletal hospital. This was not a hypothesis-driven study. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. METHODS: A retrospective review of the picture archiving and communication system as well as the electronic medical record was performed to identify patients with surfing-related injuries who presented to a tertiary care musculoskeletal hospital for treatment. The search included participants over a 10-year period who presented between January 1, 2009, and August 1, 2018. Descriptive data analyses were performed to determine frequency of body part injured, diagnosis, and operative versus nonoperative treatment. RESULTS: The search yielded 109 patients with surfing-related injuries and MRIs. A total of 90 patients presented within 6 months of their surfing injury and were included in the final analysis. The median age was 36 years (range, 12-66 years). A majority of the patients included were male (74\%; n = 67). Acute surfing injuries were diagnosed via imaging in 72\% (n = 65) of patients. The joints injured most commonly were the shoulder (46\%; n = 30) and the knee (28\%; n = 18). Only 17\% (n = 11) of acute surfing injuries required surgery, while 83\% (n = 54) were treated nonoperatively. CONCLUSION: The most common surfing-related injuries occurred in the shoulder and knee. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study helps characterize the risk of injury for surfers and informs healthcare providers on common surfing injuries.},

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of sauna bathing on the physiological parameters of young overweight, physically inactive men and to test the correlations between physiological parameters versus anthropometric features and body composition parameters.               Materials and Methods               . Forty-five overweight and sedentary men aged 20.76{\textpm}2.4 y were exposed to four sauna sessions of 10 minutes each (temperature: 90-91{$^\circ$}C; relative humidity: 14-16 \%) with four 5-minute cool-down breaks.

A significant (p{$<$}0.0001) increase in all analyzed physiological parameters was observed during four successive 10-minute sauna sessions.

This study investigated the duration, mechanisms, body locations and types of gradual-onset injuries in a sample of New Zealand surfers. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional online survey. METHODS: Self-identified surfers reported gradual-onset surfing-related injuries experienced in the preceding 12 months. RESULTS: Respondents (n=1473, age range 8-74 years) reported a total of 550 gradual-onset major injuries: 44\% acute duration ({$<$}3 months) and 56\% chronic ({$\geq$}3 months). The injury incidence proportion was 27\%. Shoulder (146 injuries, 64\% chronic), low back (115 injuries, 58\% chronic) and neck (105 injuries, 46\% chronic) were the most commonly reported injury locations. Prolonged paddling was the most commonly reported mechanism of injury (40\% of all injuries). Incidence proportion for gradual-onset major injuries was 6\% higher for greater surfing abilities compared to lower abilities (p=0.01), and 13\% higher for long boarders compared to short boarders (p=0.001). Respondents reporting any gradual-onset surfing injury, compared to those with no injury, averaged 3 more years surfing experience (p{$<$}0.001), were 3 years older (p{$<$}0.001), and reported 43h more surfing exposure in the preceding 12 months (p{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The most common gradual-onset surfing injuries involved the shoulder, low back, and neck, most frequently attributable to paddling. Risk factors for these injuries included board type, higher ability, older age, more hours/year, and years of surfing. These findings affirm the existence of sufficient injury burden to justify investigation of surfing injury prevention initiatives.},

Consequently, there is a need for tests with good psychometric properties that can be administered with minimal equipment and time. PURPOSE: (1) To establish the intersession reliability of several open kinetic chain FPT in healthy young adults with a history of overhead sport participation. (2) To examine the intersession reliability of the limb symmetry indices (LSI) from each test. STUDY DESIGN: Test-retest reliability, single cohort study. METHODS: Forty adults (20 males, 20 females) completed four upper extremity FPT during two data collection sessions three to seven days apart: 1) prone medicine ball drop test 90{$^\circ$}shoulder abduction (PMBDT 90{$^\circ$}), 2) prone medicine ball drop test 90{$^\circ$}shoulder abduction/90{$^\circ$} elbow flexion (PMBDT 90{$^\circ$}-90{$^\circ$}), 3) half-kneeling medicine ball rebound test (HKMBRT), 4) seated single arm shot put test (SSASPT). Measures of systematic bias, absolute reliability and relative reliability were computed between the sessions for both the original test scores and LSI. RESULTS: Except for the SSASPT, all tests demonstrated significant (p {$\leq$} 0.030) improvements in performance during the second session. Generally, for the medicine ball drop/rebound tests, the absolute reliability was the highest (less random error) for the HKMBRT, next the PMBDT 90{$^\circ$}followed by PMBDT 90{$^\circ$}-90{$^\circ$}. Excellent relative reliability existed for the PMBDT 90{$^\circ$}, HKMBRT, and SSASPT, whereas fair to excellent relative reliability for the PMBDT 90{$^\circ$}-90{$^\circ$}. The SSASPT LSI revealed the highest relative and absolute reliability. CONCLUSION: Two tests, HKMBRT and SSASPT demonstrated sufficient reliability; therefore, the authors' recommend those tests can be used for serial assessments to advance a patient through a rehabilitation program as well as criteria for progression to RTS.

  abstract = {We investigated functional, morphological and molecular adaptations to strength training exercise and cold water immersion (CWI) through two separate studies. In one study, 21 physically active men strength trained for 12 weeks (2 days per week), with either 10 min of CWI or active recovery (ACT) after each training session. Strength and muscle mass increased more in the ACT group than in the CWI group (P {$<$} 0.05). Isokinetic work (19\%), type II muscle fibre cross-sectional area (17\%) and the number of myonuclei per fibre (26\%) increased in the ACT group (all P {$<$} 0.05), but not the CWI group. In another study, nine active men performed a bout of single-leg strength exercises on separate days, followed by CWI or ACT. Muscle biopsies were collected before and 2, 24 and 48 h after exercise. The number of satellite cells expressing neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (10-30\%) and paired box protein (Pax7) (20-50\%) increased 24-48 h after exercise with ACT. The number of NCAM(+) satellite cells increased 48 h after exercise with CWI. NCAM(+) - and Pax7(+) -positive satellite cell numbers were greater after ACT than after CWI (P {$<$} 0.05). Phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase(Thr421/Ser424) increased after exercise in both conditions but was greater after ACT (P {$<$} 0.05). These data suggest that CWI attenuates the acute changes in satellite cell numbers and activity of kinases that regulate muscle hypertrophy, which may translate to smaller long-term training gains in muscle strength and hypertrophy. The use of CWI as a regular post-exercise recovery strategy should be reconsidered.},

METHODS: Between 2008 and 2013, 6 patients were referred to our hospital with chest injuries sustained during surfing. Clinical data were collected from their medical records and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Patient age ranged from 35 to 52 years. Five of the 6 patients were male. Four patients were injured in August, and the other two were injured in September and October. Rib fractures were observed in 3 of the 6 patients. The other 3 patients were diagnosed with chest contusions only. Hemothorax occurred in one patient. No lacerations were observed in any of the 6 patients. CONCLUSION: Chest injuries associated with surfing are usually blunt chest injuries; however, they may occasionally be life-threatening.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify whether there are any significant differences in the lower-body muscle structure and countermovement-jump (CMJ) and squat-jump (SJ) performance between stronger and weaker surfing athletes. METHODS: Twenty elite male surfers had their lower-body muscle structure assessed with ultrasonography and completed a series of lower-body strength and jump tests including isometric midthigh pull (IMTP), CMJ, and SJ. Athletes were separated into stronger (n = 10) and weaker (n = 10) groups based on IMTP performance. RESULTS: Large significant differences were identified between the groups for vastus lateralis (VL) thickness (P = .02, ES = 1.22) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) pennation angle (P = .01, ES = 1.20), and a large nonsignificant difference was identified in LG thickness (P = .08, ES = 0.89). Furthermore, significant differences were present between the groups for peak force, relative peak force, and jump height in the CMJ and SJ (P {$<$} .01-.05, ES = 0.90-1.47) and eccentric peak velocity, as well as vertical displacement of the center of mass during the CMJ (P {$<$} .01, ES = 1.40-1.41). CONCLUSION: Stronger surfing athletes in this study had greater VL and LG thickness and LG pennation angle. These muscle structures may explain their better performance in the CMJ and SJ. A unique finding in this study was that the stronger group appeared to better use their strength and muscle structure for braking as they had significantly higher eccentric peak velocity and vertical displacement during the CMJ. This enhanced eccentric phase may have resulted in a greater production and subsequent utilization of stored elastic strain energy that led to the significantly better CMJ performance in the stronger group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional movement screen (FMS) have been used to assess the movement patterns in daily sports practice. Some associations between FMS scores and physical variables have been found in some sports. Nevertheless, no study was conducted in surf. METHODS: Eighteen surf athletes (11 male) participated in the study (18.3{\textpm}6.3 years; 60.0{\textpm}9.6 kg; 168.6{\textpm}8.1 cm). All participants completed anthropometrics, knee-to-wall test, Functional Movement Screen, Isometric Knee Extension, Handgrip, Squat and Countermovement Jump. Based on that, this study investigated: 1) the variance of FMS scores between gender; 2) the association between FMS scores and physical variables of strength of upper and lower limbs, power of lower limbs and anthropometric variables; and 3) which FMS scores best explain the physical performance variables. RESULTS: The analysis of comparison between gender of each item of FMS showed significant statistical differences only in trunk stability push-up (P=0.01, ES=0.141). Kendall's Tau b correlation test between FMS scores and physical variables, revealed significant associations. After performed the stepwise multiple linear regression, FMS deep squat and trunk stability push-up explain 57\% of right side knee-to-wall test and the model is statistically significant (F(2,15)=13.097; P=0.001). In squat jump (height) the results show that FMS trunk stability push-up explains 50.3\% of this dimension and the model is statistically significant (F(1,16)=18.182; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FMS individual scores seems to better explain physical variables than total score. Only trunk stability push-up test seems to be a reliable indicator to predict physical performance in surf athletes.},

A web-based survey was conducted in May of 2015. Participants were asked a series of questions regarding surfing-related injuries and demographic characteristics. A total of 50 responses were obtained, of which 35 (70\%) reported sustaining a head injury. The most common injury was laceration of the head/face (n=27), followed by concussion (n=13). Other injuries, such as skull fracture and broken nose, were also reported. Only 2 of the 50 participants reported wearing a protective helmet. Neurosurgical intervention was required in 2 instances. Increased emphasis on preventative measures by the medical community may reduce the future incidence of such injuries. Medical professionals should be aware of the most common forms of injury sustained by the surfing population in order to better recognize and treat these conditions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of soccer (football) injuries is among the highest in sports. Despite this high rate, insufficient evidence is available on the efficacy of preventive training programmes on injury incidence. OBJECTIVE: To systematically study the evidence on preventive exercise-based training programmes to reduce the incidence of injuries in soccer. DATA SOURCES: The databases EMBASE/MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials, PEDro and SPORTDiscus™ were searched for relevant articles, from inception until 20 December 2011. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the PEDro scale. STUDY SELECTION: The inclusion criteria for this review were (1) randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials; (2) primary outcome of the study is the number of soccer injuries and/or injury incidence; (3) intervention focusing on a preventive training programme, including a set of exercises aimed at improving strength, coordination, flexibility or agility; and (4) study sample of soccer players (no restrictions as to level of play, age or sex). The exclusion criteria were: (1) the article was not available as full text; (2) the article was not published in English, German or Dutch; and (3) the trial and/or training programme relates only to specific injuries and/or specific joints. To compare the effects of the different interventions, we calculated the incidence risk ratio (IRR) for each study. RESULTS: Six studies involving a total of 6,099 participants met the inclusion criteria. The results of the included studies were contradictory. Two of the six studies (one of high and one of moderate quality) reported a statistical significant reduction in terms of their primary outcome, i.e. injuries overall. Four of the six studies described an overall preventive effect (IRR{$<$}1), although the effect of one study was not statistically significant. The three studies that described a significant preventive effect were of high, moderate and low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Conflicting evidence has been found for the effectiveness of exercise-based programmes to prevent soccer injuries. Some reasons for the contradictory findings could be different study samples (in terms of sex and soccer type) in the included studies, differences between the intervention programmes implemented (in terms of content, training frequency and duration) and compliance with the programme. High-quality studies investigating the best type and intensity of exercises in a generic training programme are needed to reduce the incidence of injuries in soccer effectively.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(3): 888-900, 2020-Combat sports (CS) are intermittent by nature and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been used as a tool to maintain and improve physical fitness among CS athletes. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis about chronic effects of HIIT in CS athletes. An electronic search was performed in PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar using the following Boolean criteria: ("CS" OR "martial arts" OR "judo" OR "taekwondo" OR "jiu jitsu" OR "boxing" OR "karate" OR "wrestling" OR "wushu" OR "kung fu") AND ("HIIT" OR "intermittent exercise" OR "sprint interval training" OR "repeated sprint training [RST]"). To be included, the studies needed to be original, involve CS athletes, present HIIT intervention protocol (HIIT, sprint interval training [SIT] or RST), and analyze chronic physiological outcomes. From 2,211 identified studies, after screening and eligibility evaluation, 12 studies were included in this review with meta-analysis. Aerobic (aerobic capacity, heart rate, and maximum oxygen uptake), anaerobic (peak and mean power in single and successive Wingate tests, and blood lactate concentration), and anthropometric outcomes (body mass and body fat percentage) were evaluated. Data of 255 subjects from 12 studies were assessed. Regarding methodological quality, 7 studies obtained 9-10/12 on the TESTEX scale. For the interventions, 5 studies used HIIT, 4 studies used RST protocols, one used SIT protocols, and one used an intermittent protocol that could not be classified. Relating to aerobic power, was found an increase in V[Combining Dot Above]O2max, with a mean difference (MD) of 2.83 ml{$\cdot$}kg{$\cdot$}min (CI 95\% = 0.40-5.25; p {$<$} 0.001) for striking and 2.36 ml{$\cdot$}kg{$\cdot$}min (CI 95\% = 1.05-3.66; p {$<$} 0.001) for grappling athletes. No differences on anaerobic peak power for striking (MD = 0.67 W; CI 95\% = -0.43 to 1.77; p = 0.23) were found, and a statistical improvement for grappling athletes, (MD = 0.51 W; CI 95\% = 0.03-0.98; p = 0.04) was found. Seven studies analyzed anthropometric variables, with differences for body mass in striking (MD = -0.93 kg; CI 95\% = -1.68 to -0.19; p = 0.01) and no differences for grappling (MD = -0.09 kg; CI 95\% = -2.80 to 2.62; p = 0.95). Differences in body fat percentage in striking (MD = 0.50\%; CI 95\% = 0.30-0.70; p {$<$} 0.001) and no differences in grappling (MD = -0.87\%; CI 95\% = -1.77 to 0.03; p = 0.06) were found. It was concluded that HIIT positively influences maximum oxygen uptake and anaerobic power in combat sport athletes, with a minor impact on body composition.},

  abstract = {We investigated whether, during maximal exercise, intercostal muscle blood flow is as high as during resting hyperpnoea at the same work of breathing. We hypothesized that during exercise, intercostal muscle blood flow would be limited by competition from the locomotor muscles. Intercostal (probe over the 7th intercostal space) and vastus lateralis muscle perfusion were measured simultaneously in ten trained cyclists by near-infrared spectroscopy using indocyanine green dye. Measurements were made at several exercise intensities up to maximal (WRmax) and subsequently during resting isocapnic hyperpnoea at minute ventilation levels up to those at WRmax. During resting hyperpnoea, intercostal muscle blood flow increased linearly with the work of breathing (R2 = 0.94) to 73.0 +/- 8.8 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 at the ventilation seen at WRmax (work of breathing approximately 550-600 J min-1), but during exercise it peaked at 80\% WRmax (53.4 +/- 10.3 ml min-1 (100 g)-1), significantly falling to 24.7 +/- 5.3 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 at WRmax. At maximal ventilation intercostal muscle vascular conductance was significantly lower during exercise (0.22 +/- 0.05 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 mmHg-1) compared to isocapnic hyperpnoea (0.77 +/- 0.13 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 mmHg-1). During exercise, both cardiac output and vastus lateralis muscle blood flow also plateaued at about 80\% WRmax (the latter at 95.4 +/- 11.8 ml min-1 (100 g)-1). In conclusion, during exercise above 80\% WRmax in trained subjects, intercostal muscle blood flow and vascular conductance are less than during resting hyperpnoea at the same minute ventilation. This suggests that the circulatory system is unable to meet the demands of both locomotor and intercostal muscles during heavy exercise, requiring greater O2 extraction and likely contributing to respiratory muscle fatigue.},

The work presented here focuses mostly on testing the theory of blood flow redistribution from the locomotor to the respiratory muscles during heavy exercise in healthy participants and in patients with COPD. What advances does it highlight? Studies presented and the direct experimental approach to measure muscle blood flow by indocyanine green dye detected by near infrared spectroscopy, show that exercise interferes with respiratory muscle blood flow especially in COPD, but even in healthy. ABSTRACT: We have developed an indicator-dilution method to measure muscle blood flow at rest and during exercise using the light absorbing tracer indocyanine green dye (ICG) injected as an intravenous bolus, with surface optodes placed over muscles of interest to record the ICG signal by near-infrared spectroscopy. Here we review findings for both quadriceps and intercostal muscle blood flow (measured simultaneously) in trained cyclists and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). During resting hyperpnoea in both athletes and patients, intercostal muscle blood flow increased with ventilation, correlating closely and linearly with the work of breathing, with no change in quadriceps flow. During graded exercise in athletes, intercostal flow at first increased, but then began to fall approaching peak effort. Unexpectedly, in COPD, intercostal muscle blood flow during exercise fell progressively from resting values, contrasting sharply with the response to resting hyperpnoea. During exercise at peak intensity, we found no quadriceps blood flow reduction in favour of the respiratory muscles in either athletes or patients. In COPD at peak exercise, when patients breathed 21\% oxygen in helium or 100\% oxygen, there was no redistribution of blood flow observed between legs and respiratory muscles in either direction. Evidence of decrease in leg blood flow and increase in respiratory muscle flow was found only when imposing expiratory flow limitation (EFL) during exercise in healthy individuals. However, because EFL caused substantial physiological derangement, lowering arterial oxygen saturation and raising end-tidal PCO2 and heart rate, these results cannot be projected onto normal exercise.},

Despite the wide-ranging health benefits of participation in organized sports, injuries occur and represent a threat to the health and performance of young athletes. Youth soccer has a greater reported injury rate than many other contact sports, and recent studies suggest that injury rates are increasing. Large increases in the incidence of concussions in youth soccer have been reported, and anterior cruciate ligament injuries remain a significant problem in this sport, particularly among female athletes. Considerable new research has identified a number of modifiable risk factors for lower-extremity injuries and concussion, and several prevention programs have been identified to reduce the risk of injury. Rule enforcement and fair play also serve an important role in reducing the risk of injury among youth soccer participants. This report provides an updated review of the relevant literature as well as recommendations to promote the safe participation of children and adolescents in soccer.},

The treatment program should be individualized with specific strengthening and flexibility exercises to achieve the dynamic stability that is required for overhead function. In this article we describe the characteristics of the throwing shoulder, along with a multiphased rehabilitation program that allows for the restoration of strength, mobility, endurance, and power and is aimed toward a return to unrestricted sporting activity. We also describe exercises that link the upper and lower extremities because of the importance of core control and leg strength in the development of power during the act of throwing. Additionally, proper throwing mechanics, utilization of pitch counts, appropriate rest, and proper off-season conditioning will help decrease overall injury risk in the overhead throwing athlete.},

  abstract = {The overhead throwing motion is an extremely stressful athletic movement. The high velocity and repetitive nature of this activity places immense pressure on the entire body, which can frequently result in injury to the throwing arm. Extensive literature exists with regards to the management of these injuries in the collegiate and professional level athlete; and it is well understood that a multiphasic approach is required to return an individual to prior level of play. However, there is a gap in the literature which fails to address the management of youth individuals. This article presents a new and innovative approach to the rehabilitation, training and management of the youth overhead throwing athlete, The Youth Throwers Ten Exercise Program. This program addresses principles of: coactivation, coordination, dynamic stabilization, neuromuscular control, proprioception, muscle strength, endurance and scapular rhythm all of which are vital for successful performance. This exercise series utilizes bodyweight and Theraband exercises that cater to the unique characteristics of the youth athlete making it a safe way to prepare for the demands of overhead throwing activities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elite throwing athletes have increased proximal humeral retrotorsion (HRT) and glenoid retroversion (GRV) in their throwing shoulders compared with their nonthrowing shoulders. These adaptive morphologic changes are thought to be independently protective against shoulder injury; however, their relationship to each other is poorly understood. PURPOSE: To determine if an association exists between HRT and GRV within the same shoulders of professional pitchers. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The HRT and GRV measurements were determined using published techniques in asymptomatic bilateral shoulders of 32 professional pitchers (mean age, 23 years). Three measurements for each variable were averaged, and the reliability of the techniques was verified. The relationship between HRT and GRV within the same shoulders was determined with Pearson correlation coefficients. Paired t tests were used to compare HRT and GRV between the throwing and nonthrowing shoulder. Simple ratios were calculated between HRT and GRV. RESULTS: Humeral retrotorsion and GRV were both significantly greater on the throwing side compared with the nonthrowing side (HRT: throwing = 9.0{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 11.4{$^\circ$} and nonthrowing = 22.1{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 10.7{$^\circ$}, P {$<$} .001; GRV: throwing = 8.6{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 6.0{$^\circ$} and nonthrowing = 4.9{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 4.8{$^\circ$}, P = .001). Within the same shoulders, there was a statistically significant positive association between HRT and GRV on the throwing side (r = 0.43, P = .016) but not on the nonthrowing side (r = -0.13, P = .50). The HRT:GRV ratio was 2.3:1 for throwing shoulders and 7:1 for nonthrowing shoulders. CONCLUSION: The concurrent increases in dominant shoulder HRT and GRV were observed as a 2:1 "thrower's ratio." As this relationship was not observed on the nondominant shoulder, it suggests that bony adaptation of the proximal humerus and glenoid are coupled during skeletal development in the throwing shoulder. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Cold water immersion (CWI) is very popular as a method reducing post-exercise muscle stiffness, eliminating fatigue, decreasing exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD), and recovering sports performance. However, there are conflicting opinions as to whether CWI functions positively or negatively. The mechanisms of CWI are still not clear. In this systematic review, we used meta-analysis aims to examine the effect of CWI on fatigue recovery after high-intensity exercise and exercise performance. A total of 20 studies were retrieved and included from PubMed, PEDro and Elsevier databases in this review. Publication years of articles ranged from 2002 to 2022. In selected studies including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Crossover design (COD). Analyses of subjective indicators such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and objective indicators such as countermovement jump (CMJ) and blood plasma markers including creatine kinase(CK), lactate/lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), C-reactive protein(CRP), and IL-6 were performed. Pooled data showed as follows: CWI resulted in a significant decline in subjective characteristics (delayed-onset muscle soreness and perceived exertion at 0~h); CWI reduced countermovement jump(CMJ) significantly at 0 h, creatine kinase(CK) was lowered at 24 h, and lactate at 24 and 48~h. There was no evidence that CWI affects C-reactive protein(CRP) and IL-6 during a 48-h recovery period. Subgroup analysis revealed that different CWI sites and water temperatures have no effect on post-exercise fatigue recovery. Recommended athletes immersed in cold water immediately after exercise, which can effectively reduce muscle soreness and accelerate fatigue recovery.},

In addition, participants tend to play more rather than less as they grow older. Injuries can occur at any point during the golf swing, from takeaway through follow-through. Upper extremity injuries can affect the hands, elbow, and shoulder and are usually a result of the golf swing at impact. Injuries are also common in the lower back as well as the lower extremities. Most injuries are the result of overuse and poor swing mechanics. When treating golfers, it is important to have a good understanding of the biomechanics and forces of the golf swing to diagnose and manage the vast spectrum of injuries incurred in this sport.},
