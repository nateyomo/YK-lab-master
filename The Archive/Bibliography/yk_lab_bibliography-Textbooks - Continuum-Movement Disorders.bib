The article presents an evaluation strategy that highly leverages the two major classification schemes of myoclonus. The goal of this article is to link evaluation strategy with diagnosis and treatment of myoclonus.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The growth of medical literature has helped better define myoclonus etiologies. Physiologic study of myoclonus types and etiologies with electrophysiologic testing has provided greater clarity to the pathophysiology of the myoclonus in various diseases. Although studies have been limited, the role of newer treatment agents and methods has made progress.                                         SUMMARY               Myoclonus has hundreds of different etiologies. Classification is necessary to evaluate myoclonus efficiently and pragmatically. The classification of myoclonus etiology, which is grouped by different clinical presentations, helps determine the etiology and treatment of the myoclonus. The classification of myoclonus physiology using electrophysiologic test results helps determine the pathophysiology of the myoclonus and can be used to strategize symptomatic treatment approaches. Both basic ancillary testing (including EEG and imaging) and more comprehensive testing may be necessary. Treatment of the underlying etiology is the ideal approach. However, if such treatment is not possible or is delayed, symptomatic treatment guided by the myoclonus physiology should be considered. More controlled study of myoclonus treatment is needed. Further research on myoclonus generation mechanisms should shed light on future treatment possibilities.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The pathology underlying {$\alpha$}-synucleinopathies, which include Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies, begins years before the presence of the full syndrome that is the basis for the clinical diagnosis of each of these disorders. This ``prodromal'' phase may manifest with various signs or symptoms. In addition to individuals in the prodromal phase, some individuals are asymptomatic but are at risk for {$\alpha$}-synucleinopathies owing to genetic predisposition or other risk factors.

RECENT FINDINGS               The major advance in the field of tardive syndromes has been the development and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of two vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, for treating tardive syndromes. These medications are derivatives of tetrabenazine and reduce dyskinetic movements by reducing dopamine stimulation. Treatment is not curative, and the medications reduce, or ``mask,'' symptoms but presumably without adding to the long-term risk of increased involuntary movements believed to accrue from suppressive treatment with dopamine receptor--blocking drugs. A confounding advance has been the accumulation of data finding that second-generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics, may not be safer than first-generation antipsychotics in causing tardive syndromes. The public health risk of tardive syndromes may actually have increased as some second-generation antipsychotics, widely promoted to both doctors and patients, are increasingly used as antidepressants.                                         SUMMARY               Tardive syndromes remain a public health risk. Second-generation antipsychotics have not been proven to have less risk than first-generation drugs in causing tardive syndromes and are nevertheless being used more widely to treat depression, bipolar disease, and insomnia. Symptomatic treatment for tardive syndromes is available, although expensive.},

Each of these disorders eventually develops signs and symptoms that distinguish it from idiopathic Parkinson disease, but these may not be present at disease onset.

RECENT FINDINGS               In recent years, it has been increasingly recognized that the symptoms of these diseases do not accurately predict the pathology, and the pathology does not accurately predict the clinical syndrome. Despite this, interest has grown in treating these diseases by targeting misfolded tau (in the case of PSP and CBD) and misfolded {$\alpha$}-synuclein (in the case of MSA).

RECENT FINDINGS               Although many different clinical manifestations of dystonia have been recognized for decades, it is only in the past 5 years that a broadly accepted approach has emerged for classifying them into specific subgroups. The new classification system aids clinical recognition and diagnosis by focusing on key clinical features that help distinguish the many subtypes. In the past few years, major advances have been made in the discovery of new genes as well as advances in our understanding of the biological processes involved. These advances have led to major changes in strategies for diagnosis of the inherited dystonias. An emerging trend is to move away from heavy reliance on the phenotype to target diagnostic testing toward a broader approach that involves large gene panels or whole exome sequencing.                                         SUMMARY               The dystonias are a large family of phenotypically and etiologically diverse disorders. The diagnosis of these disorders depends on clinical recognition of characteristic clinical features. Symptomatic treatments are useful for all forms of dystonia and include oral medications, botulinum toxins, and surgical procedures. Determination of etiology is becoming increasingly important because the number of disorders is growing and more specific and sometimes disease-modifying therapies now exist.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Growing evidence indicates that palliative care significantly improves quality of life and symptom burden for people with Parkinson disease and other serious movement disorders, while reducing caregiver burnout. An emphasis on advance care planning guides goal-directed treatment recommendations. Serious illness communication skills are evidence-based methods of relaying bad medical news to patients and mapping out values and goals in a way that provides comfort, emphasizes patient autonomy, and builds coping and resiliency strategies.                                         SUMMARY               Palliative care, when offered alongside primary medical and neurologic teams, provides an extra layer of support for people with serious illnesses. The goal of palliative care is to intensively treat total pain, which includes all of the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual distress caused by serious illness.

RECENT FINDINGS               Recent advances in genetics have led to the identification of novel genetic causes for ataxia and a more comprehensive understanding of the biological pathways critical for normal cerebellar function. When these molecular pathways become dysfunctional, patients develop cerebellar ataxia. In addition, several ongoing clinical trials for Friedreich ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia will likely result in novel symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies for ataxia. Antisense oligonucleotides for spinocerebellar ataxias associated with CAG repeat expansions might be a promising therapeutic strategy.                                         SUMMARY               Cerebellar ataxias include heterogeneous disorders affecting cerebellar function, leading to ataxic symptoms. Step-by-step diagnostic workups with genetic investigations are likely to reveal the underlying causes of ataxia. Some disease-specific therapies for ataxia exist, such as vitamin E for ataxia with vitamin E deficiency and thiamine for Wernicke encephalopathy, highlighting the importance of recognizing these forms of ataxia. Finally, genetic diagnosis for patients with ataxia will accelerate clinical trials for disease-modifying therapy and will have prognostic value and implications for family planning for these patients.},

Consequently, the diagnosis of tremor disorders can be challenging, and misdiagnoses are common. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with straightforward approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of tremors.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Focused ultrasound thalamotomy of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is an emerging and promising therapy for the treatment of essential tremor.                                         SUMMARY               The evaluation should start with a detailed tremor history followed by a focused neurologic examination, which should attend to the many subtleties of tremor phenomenology. Among other things, the history and examination are used to establish whether the primary tremor is an action tremor (ie, postural, kinetic, or intention tremor) or a resting tremor. The clinician should then formulate two sets of diagnoses: disorders in which action tremor is the predominant tremor versus those in which resting tremor is the predominant tremor. Among the most common of the former type are essential tremor, enhanced physiologic tremor, drug-induced tremor, dystonic tremor, primary writing tremor, orthostatic tremor, and cerebellar tremor. Parkinson disease is the most common disorder of resting tremor. This article details the clinical features of each of these disorders, as well as those of additional tremor disorders.},

Early in their clinical course, PSP and CBS may be difficult to distinguish from Parkinson disease and several other illnesses, but it is crucial to do so because of implications for management and prognosis.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Early accurate diagnosis of PSP and CBS remains a challenge because of heterogeneity in presenting symptoms and high frequency of coexisting pathologies (especially Alzheimer disease and vascular disease). It is increasingly recognized that patients with PSP, CBS, and other parkinsonian disorders require multidisciplinary care for optimal outcomes. With the recent proliferation of biomarker studies and therapeutic trials for tauopathies, there is growing hope that better treatments for PSP and CBS are on the horizon.

RECENT FINDINGS               Technologic advances in molecular genetic testing over the past decade continue to lead to the discovery of new diseases. This article discusses the clinical presentation and early experience with treatment for several recently described genetic forms of infantile-onset and childhood-onset dystonia and chorea.                                         SUMMARY               The clinical spectrum of pediatric movement disorders is broad and heterogeneous, ranging from acute or transient self-limited conditions to conditions that cause profound lifelong motor disability. Most movement disorders in childhood are chronic, and the large number of rare, genetic conditions associated with pediatric movement disorders can pose a significant diagnostic challenge. Recognition of distinctive diagnostic clues in the history and examination can facilitate the diagnosis of potentially treatable disorders.},

The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from paraneoplastic syndromes that progress quite rapidly to unidentified genetic disorders that progress slowly over the course of decades. This article highlights the diagnostic process, including the differential diagnosis, as well as treatment approaches and symptomatic management. The pillars of treatment are physical, occupational, and speech therapy as well as counseling and discussions of disease prognosis, genetics, and reproductive choices. There are many ways to help patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and improve their quality of life.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent years have seen significant improvements in genetic testing, with reductions in cost of both Sanger sequencing and whole exome sequencing and increasing availability of the latter. These improvements increase clinicians' ability to identify the etiology of neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and suggest future treatments.

RECENT FINDINGS               Recent advances include the finding that Tourette syndrome is likely due to a combination of several different genes, both low-effect and larger-effect variants, plus environmental factors. Pathophysiologically, increasing evidence supports involvement of the cortical--basal ganglia--thalamocortical circuit; however, the primary location and neurotransmitter remain controversial. Behavioral therapy is first-line treatment, and pharmacotherapy is based on tic severity. Several newer therapeutic agents are under investigation (eg, valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, cannabinoids), and deep brain stimulation is a promising therapy.                                         SUMMARY               Tics, defined as sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations, are essential components of Tourette syndrome. Although some tics may be mild, others can cause significant psychosocial, physical, and functional difficulties that affect daily activities. In addition to tics, most affected individuals have coexisting neuropsychological difficulties (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, mood disorder, disruptive behaviors, schizotypal traits, suicidal behavior, personality disorder, antisocial activities, and sleep disorders) that can further impact social and academic activities or employment.},

RECENT FINDINGS               A new approach to classifying dystonia has been created with the aim to increase the recognition and diagnosis of dystonia. Molecular biology and genetic studies have identified several genes and biological pathways involved in dystonia.                                         SUMMARY               Dystonia is a common movement disorder involving abnormal, often twisting, postures and is a challenging condition to diagnose. The pathophysiology of dystonia involves abnormalities in brain motor networks in the context of genetic factors. Dystonia has genetic, idiopathic, and acquired forms, with a wide phenotypic spectrum, and is a common feature in complex neurologic disorders. Dystonia can be isolated or combined with another movement disorder and may be focal, segmental, multifocal, or generalized in distribution, with some forms only occurring during the performance of specific tasks (task-specific dystonia). Dystonia is classified by clinical characteristics and presumed etiology. The management of dystonia involves accurate diagnosis, followed by treatment with botulinum toxin injections, oral medications, and surgical therapies (mainly deep brain stimulation), as well as pathogenesis-directed treatments, including the prospect of disease-modifying or gene therapies.},

The phenomenology of chorea is described in addition to other common hyperkinetic movements that may be mistaken for or coexist with chorea. Chorea can be acquired or hereditary. Key historical and clinical features that can aid in determining the etiology are reviewed, and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment strategies are discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Clinical investigations are under way to target transcription and translation of the mutant huntingtin protein as a potential disease-modifying strategy in Huntington disease (HD). Additional heritable factors have been revealed through genome-wide association studies. Symptom-focused treatments for HD are are being studied, including a third vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitor for chorea attenuation and drugs to target irritability and cognitive impairment. Increased availability of genetic testing has led to increased awareness of HD mimics (eg,                 C9orf72                 and IgLON5).                                                        SUMMARY               Chorea is a relatively common hyperkinetic disorder with a broad differential. The first step in the approach to a patient with chorea is accurately defining the phenomenology. Once it has been determined that the patient has chorea, the investigation into determining an etiology can begin. Factors such as age of onset, time course, family history, unique clinical features, and imaging and laboratory findings can guide the diagnosis. Treatments for most causes of chorea are purely symptomatic, although it is important to recognize causes that are reversible or have disease-modifying interventions.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                C9orf72 disease is the most common Huntington disease phenocopy, according to studies in the European population. Anti-IgLON5 disease can present with chorea. The role of immunotherapies in Sydenham chorea has increased, and further clinical studies may be useful. Benign hereditary chorea is a syndrome or phenotype due to mutations in several genes, including                 NKX2-1                 ,                 ADCY5, GNAO1,                 and                 PDE10A                 . New-generation presynaptic dopamine-depleting agents provide more options for symptomatic treatment of chorea with fewer adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation has been performed in several choreic disorders, but features other than chorea and the neurodegenerative nature should be taken into consideration. Studies on genetic interventions for Huntington disease are ongoing.

This article reviews the history and physical examination features pertinent for diagnosis, differential diagnoses, and treatments and approaches for optimal control of symptoms.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Essential tremor is a syndrome with symptoms extending beyond tremor to involve disturbances in gait, speech, cognition, and mood. Although the new guidelines on the definition and biaxial classification scheme have provided clarity, some tremor experts have critiqued the recently coined term                 essential tremor plus                 . For treatment, new orthotic devices and peripheral stimulation devices are now available in addition to pharmacologic and surgical options.                                                        SUMMARY               Essential tremor has a rich clinical phenomenology with many subtleties and nuances. A detailed history with open-ended questions and focused questions encompassing medical history, social history, and family history is key for establishing the diagnosis. The presence of bilateral action tremor for 3 years and absence of isolated head and voice tremor and absence of task- and position-dependent tremor are necessary for diagnosis. Dystonic tremor, Parkinson disease tremor, physiologic tremor, and drug-induced tremor are common differential diagnoses. Differentiating these tremor disorders from essential tremor based on phenomenology and physical examination alone could be challenging; thus, clinicians should seek additional clues from a detailed history. Treatment could begin with noninvasive and nonpharmacologic therapies, especially in mild cases. As the severity increases, they can advance stepwise to include pharmacotherapies and surgical interventions. With the growing recognition that essential tremor is not a monosymptomatic disorder, management should involve a multidisciplinary team. Furthermore, treatment selection should be based on shared decision making between patients and providers that gives due consideration to severity of symptoms, level of functional disability, impact on social interactions, patient preferences, and patient expectations.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms have been increasingly recognized in PD and DLB, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment strategies. While PD is most associated with and diagnosed by the presence of motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms can often be the most debilitating for patients. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are highly prevalent nonmotor features and include cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, psychosis, impulse control disorders, and apathy. Neuropsychiatric symptoms can be difficult to recognize and diagnose in patients with PD, in part because of comorbidity and symptom overlap with core PD features. Treatment strategies are a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions used in the general population and those specific to PD. DLB is a clinical dementia syndrome, often with similar cognitive, behavioral, autonomic, and motor features as PD. Moreover, DLB has shared underlying pathophysiology with PD, as both are associated with postmortem findings of {$\alpha$}-synuclein neuropathology at autopsy and have shared genetic risk and prodromal symptoms. DLB is clinically differentiated from PD by the presenting features of cognitive impairment in DLB, compared with the variable onset of cognitive impairment occurring 1 year or more after established motor onset in PD. Thus, diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB are similar to that of PD and have important implications for maintaining patient independence and providing support for caregivers because motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric symptoms have an additive effect on patient functional disability.                                         SUMMARY               A careful history and physical examination are often needed to accurately diagnose and treat the heterogeneous cognitive and behavioral symptoms of PD and DLB. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment in PD and DLB are important, as these are a considerable source of patient disability and caregiver burden.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Parkinson disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Important advances in the treatment, etiology, and the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease have been made in the past 50 years. This article provides a review of the current understanding of Parkinson disease, including the epidemiology, phenomenology, and treatment options of the disease.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Parkinson disease is now recognized to be a heterogeneous condition marked by both motor and nonmotor symptoms. It is composed of preclinical, prodromal, and clinical phases. New medications with improved ease of administration have been approved for its treatment. Innovative surgical therapies for Parkinson disease may be used when motor symptoms persist despite optimal medical management.                                         SUMMARY               Parkinson disease is a complex, heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. Considerable progress has been made in its treatment modalities, both pharmacologic and surgical. While its cure remains elusive, exciting new research advances are on the horizon.},
