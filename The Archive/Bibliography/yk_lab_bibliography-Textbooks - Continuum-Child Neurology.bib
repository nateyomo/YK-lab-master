RECENT FINDINGS               Arterial ischemic stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are increasingly recognized in childhood as important causes of lifelong morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of arterial ischemic stroke is frequently delayed, as acute neurologic deficits can be challenging to detect in the young child, and stroke is often not considered in the differential diagnosis. Neurologic sequelae following stroke are common, and strategies to minimize stroke size and optimize recovery are being developed. Recurrent arterial ischemic stroke is not uncommon, particularly in children with cerebral arteriopathy. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis causes obstruction of venous outflow leading to venous infarcts. Complications include hemorrhagic conversion of infarcts and increased intracranial pressure. Without treatment, thrombus extension with increased symptoms is common. Robust guidelines of care that exist for adults do not exist for children, particularly for children with arterial ischemic stroke.                                         SUMMARY               The approach to stroke in infants and children can be informed by clinical experience in pediatric stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, the extensive literature on pediatric thrombosis, and extrapolation from data from adult patients.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by deficits in social communication and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests. This article provides the tools to diagnose and manage patients with autism spectrum disorder.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Autism spectrum disorder is a heterogeneous condition with varying presentations, multiple etiologies, and a number of comorbidities that impact the course and management of the disorder. This article defines the core features of social communication deficits, including problems with social reciprocity, decreased nonverbal communication, and difficulties in developing and maintaining relationships. The second domain of repetitive behaviors and restricted interests, which includes the presence of stereotyped behaviors or speech, insistence on sameness and behavioral rigidity, intense or out of the ordinary interests, and unusual responses to sensory stimulation, is also delineated. Comorbidities commonly seen with autism spectrum disorder include medical, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions. Despite intense research efforts, the etiology of autism spectrum disorder remains unknown in most cases, but it is clear that a strong genetic component exists that interacts with various environmental risk factors. Current research is identifying overlapping neurobiological pathways that are involved in pathogenesis. Treatment involves intensive behavioral therapy and educational programming along with traditional ancillary services, such as speech/language, occupational, and physical therapies. Psychopharmacologic treatments are also used to target certain symptoms and comorbid conditions.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologists can play an important role in diagnosing autism spectrum disorder according to clinical criteria through a comprehensive evaluation that includes a thorough medical and developmental history, behavioral and play observations, and a review of standardized cognitive and language evaluations. Neurologists are also responsible for investigating etiologies, recommending and advocating for appropriate behavioral and educational interventions, and identifying and often managing comorbidities.},

Useful evidence-based management strategies are provided for children who have a typical recovery following concussion as well as for those who have persistent postconcussion syndrome. Cases are used to demonstrate the commonly encountered pathologies of headache, cognitive issues, and mood disturbances following injury.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               A clinical risk score using risk factors for poor recovery (eg, female sex, adolescence, previous migraine, and a high degree of acute symptoms) can be used to help the clinician plan follow-up in the community. Prolonged periods of physical and cognitive rest should be avoided.

RECENT FINDINGS               Major advances have occurred in recognizing the genetic basis of nervous system malformations. Environmental causes of nervous system malformations, such as perinatal infections including Zika virus, are also reviewed. Treatment for nervous system malformations begins prior to birth with prevention. Folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of neural tube defects and is an important part of health maintenance for pregnant women. Fetal surgery is now available for prenatal repair of myelomeningocele and has been demonstrated to improve outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Each type of nervous system malformation is relatively uncommon, but, collectively, they constitute a large population of neurologic patients. The diagnosis of nervous system malformations begins with radiographic characterization. Genetic studies, including chromosomal microarray, targeted gene sequencing, and next-generation sequencing, are increasingly important aspects of the assessment. A genetic diagnosis may identify an associated medical condition and is necessary for family planning. Treatment consists primarily of supportive therapies for developmental delays and epilepsy, but prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele offers a glimpse of future possibilities. Prognosis depends on multiple clinical factors, including the examination findings, imaging characteristics, and genetic results. Treatment is best conducted in a multidisciplinary setting with neurology, neurosurgery, developmental pediatrics, and genetics working together as a comprehensive team.},

The etiology is most often global hypoxia-ischemia due to failure of cerebral perfusion to the fetus caused by uterine, placental, or umbilical cord compromise prior to or during delivery. Other etiologies of neonatal encephalopathy include ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, infection, developmental anomalies, and inborn errors of metabolism.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Therapeutic hypothermia is standard of care for the treatment of neonatal encephalopathy presumed to be caused by hypoxia-ischemia. The number needed to treat is approximately 6 to 7 to prevent one child from either death or disability at age 18 to 22 months. EEG monitoring and MRI are important tools in determining the etiology of encephalopathy and prognosis of the infant.                                         SUMMARY               Neonatal encephalopathy is a heterogeneous disorder that is characterized by alterations in mental status, hypotonia, seizures, and abnormalities in feeding and respiration. The most common cause of neonatal encephalopathy is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, for which treatment with 72 hours of therapeutic hypothermia is associated with reduced death or disability.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Next-generation (exome- and genome-based) sequencing technologies are revolutionizing the identification of single-gene causes of epileptic encephalopathy but have only had a modest impact on patient-specific treatment decisions. The treatment of most forms of epileptic encephalopathy remains a particularly challenging endeavor, with therapeutic decisions chiefly driven by the electroclinical syndrome classification. Most antiseizure drugs are ineffective in the treatment of these disorders, and treatments that are effective often entail significant risk and cost.

The limitations of these tests are also discussed, as they only screen for a subset of the many inborn errors of metabolism that exist.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in next-generation sequencing and the emerging use of advanced metabolomic screening have made it possible to diagnose treatable inborn errors of metabolism that are not included in current newborn screening programs. Some of these inborn errors of metabolism are especially likely to present with nonspecific neurologic phenotypes, such as epilepsy, ataxia, or intellectual disability. However, cost may be a barrier to obtaining these newer tests. It is important to keep in mind that common metabolic testing may lead to treatable diagnoses. Resources are available to guide neurologists in diagnosing genetic metabolic conditions.                                         SUMMARY               This article introduces the clinical presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that are important for neurologists to consider in patients of all ages. Inborn errors of metabolism are rare, but they can present with neurologic symptoms. Newborns are now screened for many treatable metabolic disorders, but these screening tests may miss milder presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that present later in life. These patients may present to adult neurologists who may be less likely to consider metabolic genetic testing.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Pediatric presentations of sleep disorders differ from adult presentations, making diagnosis challenging. Specific clinical syndromes, such as cataplexy in children with narcolepsy type 1, can have an altogether different presentation compared to adult-onset symptoms, contributing to diagnostic delays and potential misdiagnoses. More broadly, research shows strong associations between sleep and daytime cognition, mood, and behavior among children with and without neurologic conditions and thus suggests a need to identify and treat sleep problems to optimize daytime functioning.

RECENT FINDINGS               The exponential growth of genetic testing is due to its increased speed and decreasing cost, and it is now a routine part of the clinical care for a number of neurologic patients. In addition, phenotypic pleiotropy (mutations in the same gene causing very disparate phenotypes) and genetic heterogeneity (the same clinical phenotype resulting from mutations in different genes) are now known to exist in a number of conditions, adding an additional layer of complexity for genetic testing in these disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Although the growing complexity of technical knowledge in the ordering and interpretation of genetic tests makes it necessary for neurologists to consult medical geneticists, limitations in the availability of such professionals often means neurologists will be on the front line dealing with suspected or confirmed neurogenetic conditions. The growing availability of broad genetic testing through chromosomal microarray and next-generation sequencing and the expanded phenotypic spectrum of many conditions has implications for genetic counseling and medical management.

Inadequate transition planning and execution can lead to gaps in care, unexpected emergency department visits, and an increase in health care costs and patient/caregiver anxiety. Many barriers that prevent adequate transition have been identified, including insufficient time or staff to provide transition services, inadequate reimbursement, resistance from patients and caregivers, and a dearth of accepting adult providers.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Transition is distinct from transfer of care. Transition is a planned multistage process, while transfer refers to a point in time where responsibility of care shifts from one provider to another. Key differences exist between the pediatric and adult models of care. A successful transition should empower the patient to understand and take responsibility in managing his or her condition; foster independent functioning to the extent that is possible; integrate educational, legal, and community resources in the care plan; and identify appropriate adult health care providers at the time of transfer. Different models have been proposed to streamline the transition process, with improvement in patients' knowledge of their condition, self-efficacy, and confidence.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologists have a key role in supporting their patients in the transition to adulthood. This article reviews basic tenets and provides tools to assist in navigating the complex transition process. These tenets are intended to improve quality of care and decrease clinician burden and remain an active area of research.},

RECENT FINDINGS               With a prevalence of 1\% to 3\% and substantial comorbidity, high lifetime costs, and emotional burden, intellectual developmental disorder is characterized by limitations in both intellectual functioning (IQ less than 70) and adaptive behavior starting before 18 years of age. Pinpointing the precise genetic cause is important, as it allows for accurate genetic counseling, avoidance of unnecessary testing, prognostication, and tailored  management, which, for an increasing number of genetic conditions, targets the pathophysiology and improves outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               The etiology of intellectual developmental disorder is heterogeneous, which mandates a structured approach that considers family situation, test costs, yield, and potential therapeutic tractability of the identified condition. Diagnosis of an underlying genetic cause is increasingly important with the advent of new treatments. Still, in many cases, the cause remains unknown, and research is needed to elucidate its complex molecular basis.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               All critical care is directed at maintaining brain health, but recognizing neurologic complications of critical illness in children is difficult, and limited data exist to guide practice. This article discusses an approach to the recognition and management of seizures, stroke, and cardiac arrest as complications of other critical illnesses in the pediatric intensive care unit.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures occur frequently in children after cardiac arrest or traumatic brain injury and during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Seizures may add to neurologic morbidity, and continuous EEG monitoring is needed for up to 24 hours for detection. Hypothermia has not been shown to improve outcome after cardiac arrest in children, but targeted temperature management with controlled normothermia and prevention of fever is a mainstay of neuroprotection.                                         SUMMARY               Much of brain-directed pediatric critical care is empiric. Recognition of neurologic complications of critical illness requires multidisciplinary care, serial neurologic examinations, and an appreciation for the multiple risk factors for neurologic injury present in most patients in the pediatric intensive care unit. Through attention to the fundamentals of neuroprotection, including maintaining or restoring cerebral perfusion matched to the metabolic needs of the brain, combined with anticipatory planning, these complications can be prevented or the neurologic injury mitigated.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               The leukodystrophies, typically considered incurable neurodegenerative disorders, are often diagnosed after irreversible central and peripheral nervous system injury has occurred. Early recognition of these disorders is imperative to enable potential therapeutic interventions. This article provides a summary of the symptoms of and diagnostic evaluation for leukodystrophies, along with the currently available therapies and recent advances in management.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The leukodystrophies are a rapidly expanding field because of advances in neuroimaging and genetics; however, recognition of the clinical and biochemical features of a leukodystrophy is essential to accurately interpret an abnormal MRI or genetic result. Moreover, the initial symptoms of leukodystrophies may mimic other common pediatric disorders, leading to a delay in the recognition of a degenerative disorder.                                         SUMMARY               This article will aid the clinician in recognizing the clinical features of leukodystrophies and providing accurate diagnosis and management.},
