  abstract = {Iliotibial band (ITB) syndrome is a common overuse injury in runners and cyclists. It is regarded as a friction syndrome where the ITB rubs against (and 'rolls over') the lateral femoral epicondyle. Here, we re-evaluate the clinical anatomy of the region to challenge the view that the ITB moves antero-posteriorly over the epicondyle. Gross anatomical and microscopical studies were conducted on the distal portion of the ITB in 15 cadavers. This was complemented by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of six asymptomatic volunteers and studies of two athletes with acute ITB syndrome. In all cadavers, the ITB was anchored to the distal femur by fibrous strands, associated with a layer of richly innervated and vascularized fat. In no cadaver, volunteer or patient was a bursa seen. The MR scans showed that the ITB was compressed against the epicondyle at 30 degrees of knee flexion as a consequence of tibial internal rotation, but moved laterally in extension. MR signal changes in the patients with ITB syndrome were present in the region occupied by fat, deep to the ITB. The ITB is prevented from rolling over the epicondyle by its femoral anchorage and because it is a part of the fascia lata. We suggest that it creates the illusion of movement, because of changing tension in its anterior and posterior fibres during knee flexion. Thus, on anatomical grounds, ITB overuse injuries may be more likely to be associated with fat compression beneath the tract, rather than with repetitive friction as the knee flexes and extends.},

  abstract = {The objectives of our study were: 1) to examine differences between a noninjured cohort of runners (N = 70) and runners afflicted with iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBFS) (N = 56) according to selected anthropometric, biomechanical, muscular strength, and training measures; 2) to explore multivariate relationships among these measures in both the well and injured groups; and 3) to develop specific hypotheses concerning risk factors for injury that will later be tested in a prospective observational study. High speed videography (200 fps), a force platform (500 Hz), and a Cybex II+ isokinetic dynamometer were used to assess rearfoot motion, ground reaction forces, and knee muscular strength and endurance, respectively. A linear discriminant function analysis of the training data revealed weekly mileage, training pace, number of months using current training protocol, \% time spent swimming, and \% time spent running on a track to be significant (P {$<$} 0.10). Height was a significant anthropometric discriminator, while seven isokinetic strength and endurance measures were found to discriminate significantly between the groups. Calcaneal to vertical touchdown angle, and maximum supination velocity were significant rearfoot movement discriminators. Maximum braking force was the only significant kinetic discriminator. A combined discriminant analysis using those variables found to be significant in the previous analyses revealed weekly mileage, and maximum normalized braking force to be the best discriminators (model P {$<$} 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Injury patterns in distance running may be related to kinematic adjustments induced by fatigue. The goal was to measure changes in lower extremity mechanics during an exhaustive run in individuals with and without a history of iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS). Sixteen recreational runners ran to voluntary exhaustion on a treadmill at a self-selected pace. Eight runners had a history of ITBS. Twenty-three reflective marker positions were recorded by an eight-camera 120 Hz motion capture system. Joint angles during stance phase were exported to a musculoskeletal model (SIMM) with the iliotibial band (ITB) modeled as a passive structure to estimate strain in the ITB. For ITBS runners, at the end of the run: (1) knee flexion at heel-strike was higher than control (20.6 degrees versus 15.3 degrees, p=0.01); (2) the number of knees with predicted ITB impingment upon the lateral femoral epicondyle increased from 6 to 11. Strain in the ITB was higher in the ITBS runners throughout all of stance. Maximum foot adduction in the ITBS runners was higher versus control at the start of the run (p=0.003). Maximum foot inversion (p=0.03) and maximum knee internal rotation velocity (p=0.02) were higher versus control at the end of the run. In conclusion, ITB mechanics appear to be related to changes in knee flexion at heel-strike and internal rotation of the leg. These observations may suggest kinematic discriminators for clinical assessment.},

  abstract = {We propose a biomechanical model to explain the pathogenesis of iliotibial band friction syndrome in distance runners. The model is based on a kinematic study of nine runners with iliotibial band friction syndrome, a cadaveric study of 11 normal knees, and a literature review. Friction (or impingement) occurs near footstrike, predominantly in the foot contact phase, between the posterior edge of the iliotibial band and the underlying lateral femoral epicondyle. The study subjects had an average knee flexion angle of 21.4 degrees +/- 4.3 degrees at footstrike, with friction occurring at, or slightly below, the 30 degrees of flexion traditionally described in the literature. In the cadavers we examined, there was substantial variation in the width of the iliotibial bands. This variation may affect individual predisposition to iliotibial band friction syndrome. Downhill running predisposes the runner to iliotibial band friction syndrome because the knee flexion angle at footstrike is reduced. Sprinting and faster running on level ground are less likely to cause or aggravate iliotibial band friction syndrome because, at footstrike, the knee is flexed beyond the angles at which friction occurs.},
