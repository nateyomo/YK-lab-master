  abstract = {Total joint arthroplasty has traditionally been performed as an inpatient procedure to mitigate the risks of perioperative complications, limited mobility, and pain control issues. Reducing readmissions and complications is increasingly important with the push toward outcomes based reimbursement. Nonetheless, there is a definite trend toward not only shortening postoperative length of stay but also toward considering a same day discharge arthroplasty model in appropriately selected patients. In this review, we outline the literature evidence regarding same day discharge in total joint arthroplasty and discuss our own institutional guidelines for appropriate patient selection as well as contraindications.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With the removal of both total knee and total hip arthroplasty from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' inpatient-only list, efforts to improve efficiency of the perioperative management of total joint patients have increased recently. The publication of several recent studies examining the impact of anesthesia type on outcomes has prompted the need to review the overall state of evidence for spinal versus general anesthesia for outpatient total joint arthroplasty. RECENT FINDINGS: Overall complication rates are low in this carefully selected patient population. The majority of patients who are preselected for outpatient total joint arthroplasty appear to successfully achieve this outcome. Some retrospective studies have suggested a benefit for spinal anesthesia in terms of same-day discharge success but direct comparisons in prospective studies are lacking. SUMMARY: The type of anesthesia used for total joint arthroplasty may have an important effect on outcomes. Until randomized control trials are performed we must rely on existing evidence, which suggests that both spinal and general anesthesia can lead to successful outcomes after ambulatory total joint arthroplasty.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-stay joint replacement programmes are used in many countries but there has been little scrutiny of safety outcomes in the literature. We aimed to systematically review evidence on the safety of short-stay programmes versus usual care for total hip (THR) and knee replacement (KR), and optimal patient selection. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies including a comparator group reporting on 14 safety outcomes (hospital readmissions, reoperations, blood loss, emergency department visits, infection, mortality, neurovascular injury, other complications, periprosthetic fractures, postoperative falls, venous thromboembolism, wound complications, dislocation, stiffness) within 90~days postoperatively in adults\,{$\geq$}\,18~years undergoing primary THR or KR were included. Secondary outcomes were associations between patient demographics or clinical characteristics and patient outcomes. Four databases were searched between January 2000 and May 2023. Risk of bias and certainty of the evidence were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies were included. Based upon low certainty RCT evidence, short-stay programmes may not reduce readmission (OR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.12-7.43); blood transfusion requirements (OR 1.75, 95\% CI 0.27-11.36); neurovascular injury (OR 0.31, 95\% CI 0.01-7.92); other complications (OR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.26-1.53); or stiffness (OR 1.04, 95\% CI 0.53-2.05). For registry studies, there was no difference in readmission, infection, neurovascular injury, other complications, venous thromboembolism, or wound complications but there were reductions in mortality and dislocations. For interrupted time series studies, there was no difference in readmissions, reoperations, blood loss volume, emergency department visits, infection, mortality, or neurovascular injury; reduced odds of blood transfusion and other complications, but increased odds of periprosthetic fracture. For other observational studies, there was an increased risk of readmission, no difference in blood loss volume, infection, other complications, or wound complications, reduced odds of requiring blood transfusion, reduced mortality, and reduced venous thromboembolism. One study examined an outcome relevant to optimal patient selection; it reported comparable blood loss for short-stay male and female participants (p\,=\,0.814). CONCLUSIONS: There is low certainty evidence that short-stay programmes for THR and KR may have non-inferior 90-day safety outcomes. There is little evidence on factors informing optimal patient selection; this remains an important knowledge gap.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spinal anesthesia is the predominant regimen in outpatient total joint arthroplasty (TJA), but induction often is unsuccessful, unobtainable, or against patient preference. We compared outcomes of same-day discharge (SDD) TJA with spinal versus general anesthesia in a free-standing ambulatory surgery center (ASC). METHODS: We took 105 general anesthesia TJA and one-to-one nearest-neighbor matched them to 105 spinal anesthesia TJA over 7 years at 1 ASC. The rate of successful SDD, minutes to discharge, postoperative pain and nausea, and 90-day complications were compared. Postanesthesia care unit outcomes were additionally stratified by spinal anesthetic (mepivacaine versus bupivacaine). RESULTS: All spinal anesthetic patients underwent SDD compared with 103 (98\%) general anesthetic patients (P~= .498). Mepivacaine spinal anesthesia patients spent the fewest minutes in postanesthesia care unit prior to discharge from the facility (206), followed by general anesthesia (227), and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia (291; P {$<$} .001). General anesthesia patients had the highest levels of pain at 1~hour (5.2 versus 1.5 versus 1.5) and 2~hours (3.2 versus 2.0 versus 1.3) postoperatively, and rates of nausea (48 versus 22 versus 28\%) compared with mepivacaine and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia, respectively. The 90-day complications (6 versus 7), admissions (1 versus 3), and reoperations (5 versus 2) were similar among spinal and general anesthesia, respectively (P {$\geq$} .445). CONCLUSIONS: Both spinal and general anesthesia led to reliable SDD with similar 90-day complication rates. General anesthesia facilitated faster discharge from the ASC compared with bupivacaine spinal anesthesia but led to higher levels of pain and incidence of nausea postoperatively.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orthostatic intolerance (OI)-type events following hip and knee arthroplasty increase the risk of falls, hospital length of stay, and health-care costs. There is a limited understanding of the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events in patients during the acute hospital stay. Our aim was to systematically review the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events during the acute hospital stay following hip and knee arthroplasty. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that investigated the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events was undertaken. A comprehensive search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL from their inception to October 2021. The methodological quality of identified studies was assessed using the modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (14,055 patients) were included. The incidence was 2\% to 52\% for an OI event, 1\% to 46\% for orthostatic hypotension, and 0\% to 18\% for syncope/vasovagal events. Two studies reported female sex, high peak pain levels ({$>$}5 out of 10) during mobilization, postoperative use of gabapentin, and the absence of postoperative intravenous dexamethasone as risk factors. There was no consensus on the definition and assessment of an OI-type event. CONCLUSIONS: OI-type events are common during the acute hospital stay following hip and knee arthroplasty, and 4 risk factors have been reported for OI-type events. High-quality prospective cohort studies are required to systematically and reliably determine the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level IV.

This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with persistent pain after total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) surgeries. To meet the inclusion criteria, studies were required to assess variables before or at the time of surgery, include a persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) outcome measure at least 2 months after a TKR or THR surgery, and include a statistical analysis of the effect of the risk factor(s) on the outcome measure. Outcomes from studies implementing univariate and multivariable statistical models were analyzed separately. Where possible, data from univariate analyses on the same factors were combined in a meta-analysis. Eighty-one studies involving 171,354 patients were included in the review. Because of the heterogeneity of assessment methods, only 44\% of the studies allowed meaningful meta-analysis. In meta-analyses, state anxiety (but not trait anxiety) scores and higher depression scores on the Beck Depression Inventory were associated with an increased risk of PPSP after TKR. In the qualitative summary of multivariable analyses, higher preoperative pain scores were associated with PPSP after TKR or THR. This review systematically assessed factors associated with an increased risk of PPSP after TKR and THR and highlights current knowledge gaps that can be addressed by future research.},

The aim of our quality improvement project is to reduce the acute hospitalization length of stay to less than 2 days and decrease the percentage of TKA patients discharged to inpatient rehabilitation using an enhanced recovery after surgery bundle. METHODS: This study used a before-and-after design. The pre-intervention period was January to December 2017 and the post-intervention period was January 2018 to August 2019. A root cause analysis was performed by a multidisciplinary team to identify barriers for rapid recovery and discharge. Four new interventions were chosen as part of an improvement bundle based on existing local practices, literature review, and feasibility analysis: (1) perioperative peripheral nerve block; (2) prophylactic antiemetic medication; (3) avoidance of routine preoperative urinary catheterization; and (4) preoperative patient education. RESULTS: The pre-intervention and post-intervention groups included 232 and 383 patients, respectively. Mean length of stay decreased from 2.82 to 2.13 days (P {$<$} .001). The need for inpatient rehabilitation decreased from 20.2\% to 10.7\% (P~= .002). Mean 24-hour oral morphine consumption decreased from 60 to 38 mg (P {$<$} .001). The percentage of patients experiencing moderate-to-severe pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting within the first 24 hours decreased by 25\% and 15\%, respectively (P {$<$} .001). Thirty-day emergency department visits following discharge decreased from 12.9\% to 7.3\% (P~= .030). CONCLUSION: Significant improvements in the recovery of patients after TKA were achieved by performing a root cause analysis and implementing a multidisciplinary, patient-centered enhanced recovery after surgery bundle.

As the world emerges from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdowns, it is expected that there will be an increase in surgical procedures, elevating the importance of preventing CPOP in the coming years. Risk factors are emerging to better stratify patients at high risk for CPOP. Perioperative analgesia plays an important role in managing acute postoperative pain and in some cases may limit its transition to CPOP. Acute postoperative pain is adaptive, normal, expected, and has a well-defined trajectory, while CPOP is maladaptive and, as a form of chronic pain, is challenging to treat. Good analgesia, early ambulation, and rehabilitation efforts may be helpful in preventing CPOP following certain surgeries. Enhanced~Recovery~After~Surgery (ERAS) protocols present guidance to help promote recovery and prevent CPOP.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A shift toward same-day discharge (SDD) in primary elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) has created a need to optimize patient selection and improve same-day recovery pathways. The objectives of this study were (1) to identify our institution's most common causes for failed SDD, and (2) to evaluate risk factors associated with failed SDD. METHODS: A retrospective review of SDD patients undergoing primary TKA or THA from January 2021 to September 2022 was conducted. Reasons for SDD failure were recorded and differences between successful and failed SDD cases were assessed via a multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 85.3\% (651 of 753) of patients included were successful SDDs. Failed SDD occurred in 16.8\% (74 of 441) of TKA and 11.8\% (38 of 322) of THA cases. Primary reasons included failure to clear physical therapy (33.0\%, 37 of 112), postoperative hypotension (20.5\%, 23 of 112), and urinary retention (16.9\%, 19 of 112). Analysis revealed that overall failed SDD cases were more likely to have had prior opioid use and a longer surgical time. Failed TKA SDD cases were more likely to have had a longer surgical time and not have receive a preoperative nerve block, while failed THA SDD cases were more likely to be older. CONCLUSIONS: The SDD selection criteria and pathways continue to evolve, with multiple factors contributing to failed SDD. Improving patient selection algorithms and optimizing post-operative pathways can enhance the ability to successfully choose SDD candidates. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative orthostatic intolerance can limit mobilization after hip and knee arthroplasty. The literature is lacking on the incidence and risk factors associated with orthostatic intolerance after elective arthroplasty. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study of primary total hip, total knee, and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty patients was conducted. Patients with orthostatic events were identified, and potential demographic and perioperative risk factors were recorded. Orthostatic intolerance was defined as postoperative syncope, lightheadedness, or dizziness, limiting ambulation and/or requiring medical treatment. Statistical analysis was completed using Pearson's chi-square test for categorical data and t-tests for continuous data. Binary logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: A total of 500 consecutive patients were included. The overall incidence of orthostatic intolerance was 18\%; 25\% in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 11\% in total knee arthroplasty. On univariate analysis, significant risk factors for developing postoperative orthostatic intolerance include older age, female gender, THA surgery, lower American Society of Anesthesiologists class, absence of recreational drug use, lower estimated blood volume, lower preoperative diastolic blood pressure, spinal with monitored anesthesia care (MAC), posterior approach for THA, bupivacaine use in spinal, percent of blood loss, postoperative oxycodone or tramadol use, higher postoperative intravenous fluid volume, and lower postoperative hemoglobin. Multivariate analysis demonstrated persistent significance of female gender, THA surgery, spinal with MAC, bupivacaine use in spinal, and more intravenous fluid administered postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Orthostatic intolerance affects a significant number of arthroplasty patients. Awareness of risk factors and modification of perioperative variables linked to orthostatic intolerance may assist the surgeon in choosing the appropriate surgical setting, educating patients, and improving early postoperative recovery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Readmission following total joint arthroplasty has become a closely watched metric for many hospitals in the United States due to financial penalties imposed by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The purpose of this study was to identify both preoperative and postoperative reasons for readmission within 30 days following primary total hip and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: Retrospective data were collected for patients who underwent elective primary total hip arthroplasty (THA; CPT code 27130) and TKA (27447) from 2008 to 2013 at our institution. The sample was separated into readmitted and nonreadmitted cohorts. Demography, comorbidities, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), operative parameters, readmission rates, and causes of readmission were compared between the groups using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: There were 42 (3.4\%) and 28 (2.2\%) readmissions within 30 days for THA and TKA, respectively. The most common cause of readmission within 30 days following total joint arthroplasty was infection. Trauma was the second most common reason for readmission of a THA while wound dehiscence was the second most common cause for readmission following TKA. With univariate regression, there were multiple associated factors for readmission among THA and TKA patients, including body mass index, metabolic equivalent (MET), and CCI. Multivariate regression revealed that hospital length of stay was significantly associated with 30-day readmission after THA and TKA. CONCLUSION: Patient comorbidities and preoperative functional capacity significantly affect 30-day readmission rate following total joint arthroplasty. Adjustments for these parameters should be considered and we recommend the use of CCI and METs in risk adjustment models that use 30-day readmission as a marker for quality of patient care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III/Retrospective cohort study.},

  abstract = {A rapidly aging population is currently reshaping the demographic profile of the United States. Among older patients, the cohort aged {$>$}80 years is not only living longer but also is electing to undergo more total hip and knee arthroplasties. To improve perioperative safety, orthopaedic surgeons should understand the risks and clinical outcomes of arthroplasty in patients of advanced age. Although morbidity and mortality rates are higher for patients aged {$>$}80 years than for younger patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasties and revision surgeries, functional outcomes, pain relief, and patient satisfaction are consistent between groups. In addition, geriatric co-management before total hip and total knee arthroplasty has reduced the rate of minor complications and the length of hospital stays in elderly patients. Surgeons should inform older patients and their families of the increased risks of morbidity and mortality before these procedures are undertaken.},

  abstract = {There is controversy about the incidence of and predisposing factors to the development of peripheral nerve palsy after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In this study, 19 patients with a documented neurologic complication were identified after a retrospective review of 1,476 primary TKAs performed between January 1970 and December 1998 at the New York Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia University, for an overall incidence of 1.3\%. Contrary to previously published data, valgus deformity, flexion contracture, the use of postoperative epidural anesthesia, the prolonged use of pneumatic tourniquets, and preexisting neuropathy were not associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy after TKA based on our data. A larger percentage of rheumatoid knees experienced a neurologic injury than was expected, however. No other significant risk factors for peripheral neuropathy after TKA were identified based on data from our patients. Immediately after discovery of the nerve palsy, conservative treatment was employed for each of our patients. All patients showed at least a partial recovery at the end of follow-up, with most experiencing a complete recovery from symptoms.},

METHODS: Between May 2001 and May 2013, a total of 495 patients undergoing routine TKA were analyzed retrospectively. Independent risk factors related to postoperative acute hypotension after TKA were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of the 495 patients undergoing TKA, 61 (12.32\%) developed postoperative acute hypotension after surgery. Univariate analysis showed that preoperative Neu, time of surgery, time of anesthesia, pressure of tourniquet, time of using tourniquet, preoperative hypertension, age and type of surgery were significant influencing factors, whereas by multivariate analysis, only age, pressure of tourniquet and type of surgery were significant influencing factors. CONCLUSION: Factors those were associated with a significantly increased postoperative acute hypotension after TKA included age, pressure of tourniquet and type of surgery. Achieving a good preoperative and postoperative evaluation and monitoring vital signs and disease change contribute to the detection, intervention and salvage for the acute hypotension.},

However, the incidence of preoperative anemia in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and its relationship to postoperative outcomes has not been previously reported. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search through PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Sincien, and Embase from inception to July 2023 to investigate the prevalence of preoperative anemia in patients undergoing Total Joint Arthroplasty, comorbidities between anemic and non-anemicpatients before surgery, and postoperative outcomes. postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Overall prevalence was calculated using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity between studies was examined by Cochran's Q test and quantified by the I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and validated by Egger's test. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies with 369,101 samples were included, all of which were retrospective cohort studies. 3 studies were of high quality and 18 studies were of moderate quality. The results showed that the prevalence of preoperative anemia was 22\% in patients awaiting arthroplasty; subgroup analyses revealed that the prevalence of preoperative anemia was highest in patients awaiting revision of total knee arthroplasty; the highest prevalence of preoperative anemia was found in the Americas; preoperative anemia was more prevalent in the female than in the male population; and preoperative anemia with a history of preoperative anemia was more common in the female than in the male population. patients with a history of preoperative anemia; patients with joint replacement who had a history of preoperative anemia had an increased risk of infection, postoperative blood transfusion rate, postoperative blood transfusion, Deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs, days in hospital, readmission within three months, and mortality compared with patients who did not have preoperative anemia. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of preoperative anemia in patients awaiting total joint arthroplasty is 22\%, and is higher in TKA and female patients undergoing revision, while preoperative anemia is detrimental to the patient's postoperative recovery and will increase the risk of postoperative complications, transfusion rates, days in the hospital, readmission rates, and mortality.},
