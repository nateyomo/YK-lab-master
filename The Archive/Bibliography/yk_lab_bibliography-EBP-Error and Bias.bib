  abstract = {Functional neuroimaging data embodies a massive multiple testing problem, where 100,000 correlated test statistics must be assessed. The familywise error rate, the chance of any false positives is the standard measure of Type I errors in multiple testing. In this paper we review and evaluate three approaches to thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni, random field and the permutation test. Owing to recent developments, improved Bonferroni procedures, such as Hochberg's methods, are now applicable to dependent data. Continuous random field methods use the smoothness of the image to adapt to the severity of the multiple testing problem. Also, increased computing power has made both permutation and bootstrap methods applicable to functional neuroimaging. We evaluate these approaches on t images using simulations and a collection of real datasets. We find that Bonferroni-related tests offer little improvement over Bonferroni, while the permutation method offers substantial improvement over the random field method for low smoothness and low degrees of freedom. We also show the limitations of trying to find an equivalent number of independent tests for an image of correlated test statistics.},

  abstract = {The threshold for statistical significance is determined by the maximum allowable probability of Type I error ({$\alpha$}). For studies that test multiple hypotheses or make multiple comparisons, the probability of at least 1 Type I error (family-wise error rate; FWER) increases as the number of hypotheses/comparisons increase. It is generally best practice to set the acceptable threshold for FWER to be less than or equal to {$\alpha$}. Bonferroni correction and Tukey honestly significant difference test are 2 of the more common methods to control for FWER. When doing exploratory analysis or evaluating secondary outcomes of a study, it may not be necessary or desirable to control for FWER, which reduces the power of the study. However, deciding to control for FWER should be decided during the design of the study.},

  abstract = {This article is part of a series of articles featuring the Catalogue of Bias introduced in this volume of BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine that describes attrition bias and outlines its potential impact on research studies and the preventive steps to minimise its risk. Attrition bias is a type of selection bias due to systematic differences between study groups in the number and the way participants are lost from a study. Differences between people who leave a study and those who continue, particularly between study groups, can be the reason for any observed effect and not the intervention itself. Associations for mortality in trials of tranexamic acid and upper gastrointestinal bleeding were no longer apparent after studies with high or unclear risk of attrition bias were removed. Over-recruitment can help prevent important attrition bias. Sampling weights and tailored replenishment samples can help to compensate for the effects of attrition bias when present.},

  abstract = {When simultaneously testing multiple hypotheses, the usual approach in the context of confirmatory clinical trials is to control the familywise error rate (FWER), which bounds the probability of making at least one false rejection. In many trial settings, these hypotheses will additionally have a hierarchical structure that reflects the relative importance and links between different clinical objectives. The graphical approach of Bretz et al~(2009) is a flexible and easily communicable way of controlling the FWER while respecting complex trial objectives and multiple structured hypotheses. However, the FWER can be a very stringent criterion that leads to procedures with low power, and may not be appropriate in exploratory trial settings. This motivates controlling generalized error rates, particularly when the number of hypotheses tested is no longer small. We consider the generalized familywise error rate (k-FWER), which is the probability of making~k or more false rejections, as well as the tail probability of the false discovery proportion (FDP), which is the probability that the proportion of false rejections is greater than some threshold. We also consider asymptotic control of the false discovery rate, which is the expectation of the FDP. In this article, we show how to control these generalized error rates when using the graphical approach and its extensions. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting graphical procedures on three clinical trial case studies.},
