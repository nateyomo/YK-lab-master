  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Clinical measurement validity study. OBJECTIVES: To validate the measurement of the pectoralis minor muscle length using palpable landmarks and to explore the accuracy of the measurement using a clinical instrument. BACKGROUND: The pectoralis minor is believed to adaptively shorten. Individuals with a relatively short pectoralis minor demonstrate scapular kinematic alterations that have been associated with shoulder impingement. METHODS AND MEASURES: A 3-dimensional electromagnetic motion capture system was used to calculate the length of the pectoralis minor in 11 cadavers, using 2 measurement techniques. In addition, a measurement with the electromagnetic system using palpable landmarks was compared to a measurement with both a caliper and tape measure in vivo. RESULTS: In cadavers, a measurement using palpable landmarks was determined to be a valid measure of the actual muscle length visualized and measured following dissection. There was a high intraclass correlation coefficient and a small root-mean-square error between these 2 measures. High intraclass correlation coefficients were also calculated in vivo when measurements with the clinical instruments were compared with the electromagnetic device measures. CONCLUSION: A measurement using palpable landmarks for pectoralis minor length validly represents the muscle length in cadavers. A caliper or tape measure may be used clinically with high accuracy and may help clinicians determine the need for and the effectiveness of interventions for lengthening this muscle.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The clinical diagnosis of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is based on 3 tests: anterior drawer, pivot shift and Lachman. The latter is the most commonly used test. The "lever sign" is a new clinical test that was first described by Lelli et al. in 2014. The primary objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of the lever sign test for the clinical diagnosis of ACL tears, in the primary care setting of patients with acute knee injuries. Primary care being the first point of contact between patients and the healthcare system (general practitioners in this study). The secondary objective was to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) of the lever sign test, by comparing it to the PPV of the Lachman test and its sensitivity. The working hypothesis was that the sensitivity of the lever sign test was equal to or greater than 80\%. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included patients with ski-related knee injuries which occurred in French ski resorts between December 1, 2019, and March 15, 2020. The Lachman test and the lever sign test were performed by 36 mountain physicians and were compared to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. The lever sign test involved placing a closed fist under the patient's calf in the supine position and applying downward pressure over the quadriceps. Depending on whether the ACL was intact or not, the patient's heel would either rise off the examination table or remain still. This study included 258 patients: 190 women and 68 men. RESULTS: The MRIs found 219 ACL tears and 36 intact ACLs. Three MRIs were deemed uninterpretable. The sensitivity of the lever sign test was 61.2\% and the PPV was 83.8\%. The sensitivity of the Lachman test was 99.1\% and the PPV was 86.5\%. CONCLUSION: This study determined the sensitivity of the lever sign test for the clinical diagnosis of ACL tears during real-life situations encountered by mountain physicians. This sensitivity was lower than expected. The Lachman test, on the other hand, showed a very high sensitivity. It remains the test of choice for the clinical diagnosis of ACL tears in patients with knee injuries. Therefore, the lever sign test can complement the Lachman test but is not a substitute for it.

PURPOSE: To review the diagnostic accuracy of examination tests used in LET. DESIGN: Systematic review following PRISMA-DTA guidelines. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases. The QUADAS-2 checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of the eligible studies. We included diagnostic studies reporting the accuracy of physical examination tests or imaging modalities used in patients with LET. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies with 1370 participants were identified reporting the diagnostic performance of Ultrasound Imaging (USI) (18 studies), physical examination tests (2 studies) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (4 studies). Most studies (97\%) were assessed with "unclear" or "high risk" of bias. Sonoelastography showed the highest sensitivity (75- 100\%) and specificity (85- 96\%). Grayscale with or without Doppler USI presented poor to excellent values (sensitivity: 53\%-100\%, specificity: 42\%-90\%). MRI performed better in the diagnosis of tendon thickening and enthesopathy (sensitivity and specificity: 81\%-100\%). The Cozen's test reported high sensitivity (91\%) while a grip strength difference of 5\%-10\% between elbow flexion and extension showed high sensitivity (78\%-83\%) and specificity (80\%-90\%). CONCLUSIONS: Cozen's test and grip strength measurement present high accuracy in the diagnosis of LET but are poorly investigated. USI and MRI provide variable diagnostic accuracy depending on the entities reported and should be recommended with caution when differential diagnosis is necessary. Substantial heterogeneity was found in inclusion criteria, operator/ examiner, mode of application, type of equipment and reference standards across the studies.

METHODS: A search of PubMed and SPORTDiscus databases were performed to identify movement, balance, hop/jump, or agility functional performance tests from the current peer-reviewed literature used to assess function of the hip in young, athletic subjects. RESULTS: The single-leg stance, deep squat, single-leg squat, and star excursion balance tests (SEBT) demonstrated evidence of validity and normative data for score interpretation. The single-leg stance test and SEBT have evidence of validity with association to hip abductor function. The deep squat test demonstrated evidence as a functional performance test for evaluating femoroacetabular impingement. Hop/Jump tests and agility tests have no reported evidence of reliability or validity in a population of subjects with hip pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Use of functional performance tests in the assessment of hip dysfunction has not been well established in the current literature. Diminished squat depth and provocation of pain during the single-leg balance test have been associated with patients diagnosed with FAI and gluteal tendinopathy, respectively. The SEBT and single-leg squat tests provided evidence of convergent validity through an analysis of kinematics and muscle function in normal subjects. Reliability of functional performance tests have not been established on patients with hip dysfunction. Further study is needed to establish reliability and validity of functional performance tests that can be used in a young, athletic population with hip dysfunction.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An accurate and specific diagnosis prevents the recurrences of low back pain and chronic spinal pain. The physical examination is the most useful tool to diagnosis. The examiner must aim to determine the exact tissue that pain arises from to make the specific diagnosis. Lumbar disc herniation is 1 disease that physical examination, symptoms, and findings on imaging technique do not always correlate with each other. The Straight Leg Raising (SLR) test has been used as the primary test to diagnosis lumbar disc herniations and found to have high correlation with findings on operation since its sensitivity is high in only disc herniations leading to root compression that may eventually need operation. More sensitive test, like the Slump, might be used in herniations in which the SLR is negative. The Slump test is really a variant of the SLR and the Las{\`e}gue's tests performed in the seated position and is a progressive series of maneuvers designed to place the sciatic nerve roots under increasing tension. At each step in the procedure, the patient informs the examiner what is being felt and whether radicular pain is produced. As a result, the Slump test applies traction to the nerve roots by incorporating spinal and hip joint flexion into the leg raising and would warn the examiner of the presence of nerve root compression when there is a negative SLR test. OBJECTIVES: This study measured the sensitivity and specificity of the Slump test and compare it with the SLR test in patients with and without lumbar disc herniations. METHODS: A prospective case control study of 75 patients with complaints suggestive of lumbar disc herniation was carried out in the outpatient clinics of the neurosurgery department of a state teaching hospital. Seventy-five referred or self-admitted patients with low back, leg, or low back and leg pain who had results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine were included in the study. Thirty-eight patients had signs of herniation demonstrated by MRI. Control patients (n = 37) had no disc bulges or herniations on MRI. Both the Slump and SLR tests were performed during the assessment of all the patients by the second author. The MRI results were assessed and recorded by the first author. RESULTS: The Slump test was found to be more sensitive (0.84) than the SLR (0.52) in the patients with lumbar disc herniations. However, the SLR was found to be a slightly more specific test (0.89) than the Slump test (0.83). CONCLUSION: The Slump test might be used more frequently as a sensitive physical examination tool in patients with symptoms of lumbar disc herniations. In contrast, owing to its higher specificity, the SLR test may especially help identify patients who have herniations with root compression requiring surgery.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: The Foot Posture Index-6 (FPI-6) is considered a simple quantification tool to assess static foot alignment. Palpation of the foot is required for assessment of one of the six criteria that comprise the FPI-6; the remaining five criteria may be evaluated using still-frame photographs. Using only the image-based criteria may allow multiple clinicians to evaluate large groups of patients quickly. Reliability using only these five image-based criteria has not been established. The purposes of the current study were to establish the inter- and intra-rater reliability using five image-based criteria from the Foot Posture Index-6 (FPI-6) as well as to examine the agreement between the raters in identifying foot type using the composite five FPI scores. METHODS: Forty participants (23 females, 17 males; 23.67 {\textpm} 8.49 years; 64.59 {\textpm} 14.43 kg; 166.07 {\textpm} 11.79 cm) volunteered for this study. An investigator took three photos with a digital camera of the medial longitudinal arch, posterior ankle, and of the talonavicular joint approximately 45{$^\circ$} from the posterior calcaneus for both right and left feet. Two investigators assessed the five image-based criteria of the FPI-6 for both feet of 40 participants on three occasions separated by a day. Inter-and intra-rater reliability were assessed with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC3,2). The amount of agreement for classification of foot posture type between the two raters was assessed with Cohen's kappa coefficient. Significance was set a priori at P {$<$} 0.05. RESULTS: The inter-rater reliability was poor to moderate for all three sessions (ICC3,2 = 0.334-0.634). For the foot posture classification, the amount of agreement between two raters was poor for left ({$\kappa$}= 0.12) and right ({$\kappa$}= 0.19) feet. The intra-rater reliability was excellent for left (ICC3,2=0.956) and right feet (ICC3,2=0.959). CONCLUSIONS: Excellent intra-rater and poor to moderate inter-rater reliability was found using only the five image-based criteria of the FPI-6. However, the classification of foot posture did not improve the amount of agreement between raters. Therefore, caution is needed when interpreting FPI scores from five image-based criteria.
