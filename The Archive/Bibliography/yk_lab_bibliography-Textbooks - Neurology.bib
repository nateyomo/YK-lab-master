  abstract = {"The sixth edition of Duus' classic Topical Diagnosis in Neurology builds on the clear, integrated presentation of anatomy, function, and disorders of the central nervous system that made it a success for almost over five decades, serving as a quick reference for practitioners and trainees alike. It elucidates the neuroanatomical pathways that lead to specific clinical syndromes, and demonstrates how comprehensive anatomical knowledge combined with a thorough neurological examination can help localize and categorize a lesion and arrive at a differential diagnosis. The time-tested logical, thematic structure with useful summaries, at the beginning of each chapter, and color-coded section headings enable readers to distinguish neuroanatomical from clinical material at a glance and enable efficient and time saving study. Features of the sixth edition: - New tables and clinical case examples - Improved descriptions of neuroanatomical/neurophysiological basics in the context of clinical symptoms - Twenty-three new illustrations, to a total of more than 400 illustrations - A wide range of study aids and clinical correlations that support the emphasis on integrative medicine in the current medical school curricula Topical Diagnosis in Neurology is an ideal reference for neurologists and neuroscientists who correlate neurological diseases with anatomical location to arrive at a diagnosis or understand a clinical syndrome. It is also an essential tool for trainees and advanced students who need a solid grounding in key neurofunctional relationships"--Provided by publisher},

This book brings a pioneering interactive approach to the teaching of neuroanatomy and comprises 19 chapters that explain the major neuroanatomical systems. Each chapter first presents background material-including an overview of relevant neuroanatomical structures and pathways-and a brief discussion of related clinical disorders. The second half of each chapter is devoted to clinical cases. The cases begin with a narrative of how the patient developed symptoms and what deficits were found on neurological examination. A series of questions challenges the reader to deduce the neuroanatomical location of the patient's lesion and the diagnosis. Discussion and answers follow, revealing the actual outcome. This third edition is fully updated with the latest advances in the field and includes several new cases and enhanced online and digital components"},

It is the first book in this area to summarize the neuroanatomical and functional underpinnings of consciousness by emphasizing a lesional approach offered by the study of neurological patients. Since the publication of the first edition in 2009, new methodologies have made consciousness much more accessible scientifically. In particular, the study of disorders, disruptions, and disturbances of consciousness has added tremendously to our understanding of the biological basis of human consciousness. The publication of a new edition is both critical and timely for continued understanding of the field of consciousness. In this update, revised and new contributions by internationally renowned researchers, edited by the leaders in the field of consciousness research, provide a unique and comprehensive focus on human consciousness."--Back cover},

These eleven chapters delineate common neurologic disease and injury processes, the current medical management, and the targeted physical therapy evaluation and treatment for each, examining the emerging evidence of how physical therapy can influence neuroplasticity.

  abstract = {It's happened to all of us: our cheeks flush red when we say the wrong thing, or our hearts skip a beat when a certain someone walks by. But few of us realize how much more dramatic and extreme our bodies' reactions to emotions can be. Many people who see their doctor have medically unexplained symptoms, and in the vast majority of these cases, a psychosomatic cause is suspected. And yet, the diagnosis of a psychosomatic disorder can make a patient feel dismissed as a hypochondriac, a faker, or just plain crazy. Neurologist Suzanne O'Sullivan, MD, takes us on a journey through the world of psychosomatic illness, where we meet patients such as Rachel, a promising young dancer now housebound by chronic fatigue syndrome, and Mary, whose memory loss may be her mind's way of protecting her from remembering her husband's abuse. O'Sullivan reveals the hidden stresses behind their mysterious symptoms, approaching a sensitive topic with patience and understanding. She addresses the taboos surrounding psychosomatic disorders, teaching us that "it's all in your head" doesn't mean that something isn't real, as the body is often the stand-in for the mind when the latter doesn't possess the tools to put words to its sorrow. She encourages us to look with compassion at the ways in which our brains act out, and to question our failure to credit the intimate connection between mind and body},
