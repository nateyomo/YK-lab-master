  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cost-benefit analyses have been proposed for determining acceptable risk of injury regarding training and competition participation. Currently, there is no best evidence synthesis of the literature evaluating the relationship between injury/illness and chance of success or failure. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between injury and/or illness and success and/or failure in athletic populations (individual and team sports). METHODS: This review was prospectively registered (PROSPERO CRD42016036729) and a systematic electronic search was conducted in May 2016. Inclusion criterion was any study design describing the association between injury and/or illness and success or failure in athletic performance. Two independent authors screened search results, performed data extraction and assessed methodological quality and strength of evidence using a modified Downs and Black appraisal tool and a modified van Tulder method, respectively. RESULTS: Of 10\,546 titles identified, 14 satisfied the inclusion criteria and 7 had low risk of bias. Outcome measures associated with success and/or failure included: (1) availability of team members, (2) injury incidence, (3) injury burden, (4) squad utilisation and (5, 6) precompetition and in-competition injury. There was strong evidence that (1) increased availability of team members/athletes decreased the risk of failure and (2) precompetition and in-competition injuries were associated with increased risk of failure. CONCLUSIONS: Injuries have a detrimental impact on team and individual athletic success. Increased player availability improves chances of success. Conversely, injuries sustained both prior to and during competition may increase risk of failure. Injury prevention should therefore be a priority for maximising athletic performance.},

  abstract = {Soccer injuries are a recognized problem worldwide. Several injury prevention programs have been confirmed to reduce the number of injuries in female and male players. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data about their cost, burden, and benefit for the health care system. In this paper we aim to systematically review the literature and critically evaluate the economic quality of injury prevention interventions implemented across different populations of soccer players. Web of Science, Medline, SPORTDiscus, Ovid, and other databases were searched from January 2011 through July 2021. Research articles were only selected for analysis if they focused on the cost-effectiveness of injury prevention, were experimental papers written in English, and were published following the peer-review process. Three cluster RCT and one retrospective study met the criteria. Cost data on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were extracted. The included studies had a good/average quality of economic evaluation. Based on ICERs, injury prevention interventions were cost-effective in three out of the three comparisons. One study did not report the ICER value. However, since economic analyses were reported with varying methodological approaches and results, more data are required to recognize the cost-effectiveness of soccer-specific injury prevention interventions and their benefit for the health care system.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify, summarise and critically assess economic evaluation studies on sports injury prevention strategies. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, SportDiscuss. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: The current literature was searched following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Economic analyses published since 2010 were checked for inclusion. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Level of Evidence for economic and decision analysis; underlying randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were rated according to the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) Scale, and risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The quality assessment revealed limited data quality. For trial-based analysis, underlying RCTs were of good quality and had a low risk of bias. Prevention concepts for general injury reduction showed effectiveness and cost savings. Regarding specific injury types, the analysis of the studies showed that the best data are available for ankle, hamstring and anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Measures using specific training interventions were the predominant form of prevention concepts; studies investigating these concepts showed cost-effectiveness with total cost savings between {\texteuro}24.82 and {\texteuro}462 per athlete. CONCLUSION: Injury prevention strategies that were studied are cost-effective. However, estimates and outcomes vary throughout the included studies, and precluded pooling of existing data. Knowledge about the cost-effectiveness of evaluated prevention measures will help improve the acceptance and application of prevention initiatives.},
