  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and summarise the evidence for the effects of neuromuscular training compared with any other therapy (conventional training/sham) on knee proprioception following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. DESIGN: Systematic Review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, AMED, Scopus and Physical Education Index were searched from inception to February 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials investigating the effects of neuromuscular training on knee-specific proprioception tests following a unilateral ACL injury were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the eligible studies using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. Overall certainty in evidence was determined using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. RESULTS: Of 2706 articles retrieved, only 9 RCTs, comprising 327 individuals with an ACL reconstruction (ACLR), met the inclusion criteria. Neuromuscular training interventions varied across studies: whole body vibration therapy, Nintendo-Wii-Fit training, balance training, sport-specific exercises, backward walking, etc. Outcome measures included joint position sense (JPS; n=7), thresholds to detect passive motion (TTDPM; n=3) or quadriceps force control (QFC; n=1). Overall, between-group mean differences indicated inconsistent findings with an increase or decrease of errors associated with JPS by {$\leq$}2{$^\circ$}, TTDPM by {$\leq$}1.5{$^\circ$} and QFC by {$\leq$}6\,Nm in the ACLR knee following neuromuscular training. Owing to serious concerns with three or more GRADE domains (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness or imprecision associated with the findings) for each outcome of interest across studies, the certainty of evidence was very low. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of interventions, methodological limitations, inconsistency of effects (on JPS/TTDPM/QFC) preclude recommendation of one optimal neuromuscular training intervention for improving proprioception following ACL injury in clinical practice. There is a need for methodologically robust RCTs with homogenous populations with ACL injury (managed conservatively or with reconstruction), novel/well-designed neuromuscular training and valid proprioception assessments, which also seem to be lacking.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Return-to-activity (RTA) assessments are commonly administered after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) to manage the patient's postoperative progressions back to activity. To date, few data are available on the clinical utility of these assessments to predict patient outcomes such as secondary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury once the athlete has returned to activity. OBJECTIVE: To identify the measures of patient function at 6 months post-ACLR that best predict RTA and second ACL injury at a minimum of 2 years after ACLR. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 patients with primary, unilateral ACLR completed functional assessments at approximately 6 months post-ACLR. Of these, 192 (82.1\%) completed follow-up at {$\geq$}2 years post-ACLR. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The 6-month functional assessments consisted of patient-reported outcomes, isokinetic knee-flexor and -extensor strength, and single-legged hopping. We collected RTA and secondary ACL injury data at {$\geq$}2 years after ACLR. RESULTS: Of the patients who were able to RTA (n = 155), 44 (28.4\%) had a subsequent ACL injury, 24 (15.5\%) to the ipsilateral graft ACL and 20 (12.9\%) to the contralateral ACL. A greater proportion of females had a secondary injury to the contralateral ACL (15/24, 62.5\%), whereas a greater proportion of males reinjured the ipsilateral ACL graft (15/20, 75.0\%; P = .017). Greater knee-extension symmetry at 6 months increased the probability of reinjury (B = 0.016, P = .048). Among patients with RTA at {$<$}8 months, every 1\% increase in quadriceps strength symmetry at 6 months increased the risk of reinjury by 2.1\% (B = 0.021, P = .05). Among patients with RTA at {$>$}8 months, every month that RTA was delayed reduced the risk of reinjury by 28.4\% (B = -0.284, P = .042). Descriptive statistics of patient function stratified between the early and delayed RTA groups can be found in the Supplemental Table (available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0407.20.S1). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with more symmetric quadriceps strength at 6 months post-ACLR were more likely to experience another ACL rupture, especially those who returned to sport at {$<$}8 months after the index surgery. Clinicians should be cognizant that returning high-functioning patients to activity at {$<$}8 months post-ACLR may place them at an increased risk for reinjury.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reactive decision-making during athletic movement has been demonstrated to evoke unfavorable biomechanics associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. However, the current evidence is based on assessments of healthy individuals. We aimed to investigate unplanned jump landing kinetics and knee kinematics in ACL-reconstructed (ACLR) and non-injured athletes. METHODS: A total of 30 male professional soccer players (n\,=\,15 ACLR after return to play, n\,=\,15 matched controls) performed six drop landings onto a force plate. As a neurocognitive challenge requiring decision-making, a diode flashing in randomly selected colors indicated the requested landing location. Knee joint kinematics (flexion, valgus and tibial rotation angles) assessed with a 10-camera motion capture system, vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), time to stabilization (TTS) and length of the center of pressure (COP) trace (all analyzed from force plate data) were calculated. Cognitive function was assessed using the CNS Vital Signs battery. RESULTS: The ACLR group produced lower knee flexion angles than the control group (median [interquartile range] 50.00{$^\circ$} [6.60] vs. 55.20{$^\circ$} [4.45], p\,=\,.02). In addition, path length of the center of pressure (379~mm [56.20] vs. 344~mm [37.00], p\,=\,.04) and ground reaction force (3.21 N/kg [0.66] vs. 2.87 N/kg [0.48], p\,=\,.01) were higher for the ACLR group. No differences were found for knee valgus (p\,=\,.96), tibial rotation (p\,=\,.83) and TTS (p\,=\,.82). ACLR participants scored lower for reaction time (p\,=\,.02) and processing speed (p\,=\,.01). Unfavorable knee biomechanics were more often related to cognitive function in the ACLR group than in the control group (p\,{$<$}\,.05). CONCLUSIONS: Impaired reactive decision-making during athletic movement may contribute to the high re-injury risk in individuals with ACLR. Prospective studies confirming potential cause-effect relationships are warranted.},

The postinjury neuroplasticity can cause neural compensations that increase reliance on neurocognition. Return-to-sport testing quantifies physical function but fails to detect important neural compensations. To assess for neural compensations in a clinical setting, we recommend evaluating athletes' neurocognitive reliance by augmenting return-to-sport testing with combined neurocognitive and motor dual-task challenges.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Ovid, EBMSCO-host, ScienceDirect, CNKI, VIP, WanFang Data and CBM were searched until 2nd October 2020. REVIEW METHODS: Trials with proprioceptive training for patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were included. Study screening, data extraction, risk of bias and quality assessments were performed independently by two researchers. We performed a stratified analysis based on the quality of the study. Sensitivity analyses were performed if the heterogeneity was high. RESULTS: Seventeen trials with 878 participants were included, and 12/17 with low quality. After stratified analysis, the pooled effect of high-quality studies showed significant improvement for proprioceptive training group in range of motion (P\,{$<$}\,0.05, I2\,=\,0\%), but no differences in Cincinnati knee rating system score (P\,{$>$}\,0.05, I2\,=\,83\%), hop test (P{$>$}0.05, I2\,=\,0\%) and proprioception (P\,=\,0.17, I2\,=\,77\%) compared to conventional training group; while the pooled effect of low-quality studies showed significant differences in knee functional improvement (P\,{$<$}\,0.00001, I2\,=\,69\%), but no difference in proprioception (P {$>$} 0.05, I2\,=\,84\%) between two groups. The pooled effect of all studies showed a significant benefit in both function and proprioception. CONCLUSION: The effects of proprioceptive training on knee functional and proprioceptive improvement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is mixed. It is more likely that proprioceptive training in high-quality studies has few detectable effects and that low-quality studies show an effect because of an unconscious bias. A large well designed high-quality study needs to be undertaken in the future.},

Rehabilitation aims to regain symmetrical knee strength and function to minimize the risk of a second ACL injury after RTS. PURPOSE: To determine the effect of absolute quadriceps and hamstring strength, normalized by body weight, on the risk of a second ACL injury during the first 2 years after RTS in patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction (ACLR). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Data from patients after index ACLR at the time of RTS were extracted from a rehabilitation registry-Project ACL. Patients who had performed isokinetic tests for quadriceps and hamstring strength and hop tests before RTS were included. The endpoint was a second ACL injury or a follow-up of 2 years after RTS after ACLR. RESULTS: A total of 835 patients (46\% women), with a mean age of 23.9 {\textpm} 7.7 years, were included. During the study period, 69 (8.3\%) second ACL injuries (ipsilateral and contralateral) occurred. Greater relative quadriceps strength in the injured leg increased the risk of a second ACL injury (relative risk [RR], 1.69 [95\% CI, 1.05-2.74]; P = .032). In patients who had recovered symmetrical quadriceps strength (limb symmetry index {$\geq$}90\%), there was no effect of quadriceps strength on the risk of second ACL injury (RR, 1.33 [95\% CI, 0.69-2.56]; P = .39). Quadriceps strength on the healthy side or hamstring strength, regardless of side, had no effect on the risk of a second ACL injury. CONCLUSION: Greater relative quadriceps strength in the injured leg at the time of RTS after ACLR was associated with an increased risk of a second ACL injury. There was no effect of relative quadriceps strength on the risk of a second ACL injury in patients who had recovered symmetrical quadriceps strength.},

  abstract = {Study Design Prospective cohort. Background The high risk of second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries after return to sport highlights the importance of return-to-sport decision making. Objective return-to-sport criteria frequently use limb symmetry indexes (LSIs) to quantify quadriceps strength and hop scores. Whether using the uninvolved limb in LSIs is optimal is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the uninvolved limb as a reference standard for LSIs utilized in return-to-sport testing and its relationship with second ACL injury rates. Methods Seventy athletes completed quadriceps strength and 4 single-leg hop tests before anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and 6 months after ACLR. Limb symmetry indexes for each test compared involved-limb measures at 6 months to uninvolved-limb measures at 6 months. Estimated preinjury capacity (EPIC) levels for each test compared involved-limb measures at 6 months to uninvolved-limb measures before ACLR. Second ACL injuries were tracked for a minimum follow-up of 2 years after ACLR. Results Forty (57.1\%) patients achieved 90\% LSIs for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. Only 20 (28.6\%) patients met 90\% EPIC levels (comparing the involved limb at 6 months after ACLR to the uninvolved limb before ACLR) for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. Twenty-four (34.3\%) patients who achieved 90\% LSIs for all measures 6 months after ACLR did not achieve 90\% EPIC levels for all measures. Estimated preinjury capacity levels were more sensitive than LSIs in predicting second ACL injuries (LSIs, 0.273; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.010, 0.566 and EPIC, 0.818; 95\% CI: 0.523, 0.949). Conclusion Limb symmetry indexes frequently overestimate knee function after ACLR and may be related to second ACL injury risk. These findings raise concern about whether the variable ACL return-to-sport criteria utilized in current clinical practice are stringent enough to achieve safe and successful return to sport.

  abstract = {The incidence of knee injuries in sport, particularly involving the ACL, appears to be increasing yearly, especially in younger age athletes. Even more concerning is the frequency of ACL reinjury also appears to be increasing year after year. Improving the objective criteria and testing methods used to determine return to play (RTP) readiness following ACL surgery is one aspect of the rehabilitation process that can significantly help in reducing reinjury rates. Currently, the majority of clinicians are still using post operative time frames as their number one criterion for clearance to RTP. This flawed method demonstrates an inadequate reflection of the true unpredictable, dynamic environment athletes are returning to participate in. In our clinical experience, objective testing to allow for clearance to sport participation following an ACL injury should incorporate neurocognitive and reactive testing due to the nature of the injury typically occurs because of failed control of unanticipated reactive movements. The purpose of this manuscript is to share a neurocognitive testing sequence we currently employ consisting of 8 tests in 3 categories: Blazepod tests, reactive shuttle run tests, and reactive hop tests. The use of a more dynamic reactive testing battery may decrease the reinjury rates when an athlete is cleared for participation by measuring readiness in chaotic circumstances that are more truly reflective of the sporting environment the athlete is working to return to and in the process give them a greater sense of confidence.},
