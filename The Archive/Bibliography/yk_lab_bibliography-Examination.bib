  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Selective Functional Movement Assessment (SFMA) is a functional movement assessment method to observe movement restrictions in individuals with known musculoskeletal disorders, although it has also been used to evaluate healthy athletes of different sports. AIM: The present paper aimed to evaluate the applicability of SFMA in a clinical setting and to verify whether a student can correctly perform it. METHODS: An introductory and explanatory email was sent to the subjects, containing the instructions needed to produce a video with SFMA evaluation movements. SFMA methodology was then used to analyze the received videos. The results between interobserver and intraobserver agreement were compared to the literature, considered the gold standard methods. RESULTS: Twenty-eight subjects (17.71 {\textpm} 1.96 years aged) were rated. The functional non-painful scenario (FN) has been assigned more frequently by all raters. The student's intra-rater reliability proved to be moderate (Kappa coefficient 0.49). Results for inter-rater reliability showed that the reliability degree between the senior physiotherapist and student before and after their educational path is good (Kappa coefficient 0.60 and 0.62, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed SFMA intra-rater reliability to be moderate, while inter-rater reliability can be considered good. These characteristics make it a valuable tool for sport's needs, even when used by students.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper extremity Physical Performance Tests (PPTs) have been used in sports contexts to provide functional status of the athletes. However, whether these tests present appropriate measurement properties to be considered a valuable measurement is not clear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the measurement properties of upper extremity PPTs in athletes. METHODS: Databases (e.g., Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, CENTRAL) were searched in March 2021. Two reviewers independently rated the methodological quality using the 4-point Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Quality of evidence was graded by measurement property for each test, considering the adequacy, the sample size, and the methodological quality of the studies. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included with a pooled sample of 684 athletes. The PPTs analyzed were Arm-Jump Board Test, Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test (CKCUEST), Finger Hang Test, Medicine Ball Explosive Power Test, One-Arm Hop Test, Posterior Shoulder Endurance Test, Pull-Up Shoulder Endurance Test, Repetition to Failure Assessment, Seated Medicine Ball Throw Test (SMBT), Seated Single-Arm Shot-Put Test (SSPT), Shoulder Endurance Test, Two-Arm Bent Hang Test, Unilateral Seated Shot-Put Test, and Upper Limb Rotation Test. Evidence synthesis provided moderate and high-quality evidence for sufficient inter-session and intra-session reliability of the CKCUEST, respectively. There was moderate evidence for sufficient inter-session reliability of the SSPT and for insufficient validity of the SMBT. CONCLUSION: The CKCUEST and the SSPT are sufficiently reliable in athletes. More studies are needed to investigate other psychometric properties for these tests and other upper extremity PPTs.},

Subjects were able to hold many of the positions for a mean score of approximately 40 seconds. There were no side-to-side differences in test position hold times per gender. Males were able to hold some positions significantly longer than their female counterparts. Males with a lower BMI were able to hold 8 of the 10 positions significantly longer than those with a higher BMI. Bunkie test scores in subjects with a prior history of musculoskeletal injury were similar to those with no history of injury. The normative data presented in this study may be used by rehabilitation professionals when assessing and rehabilitating their patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical therapy intervention is often sought to treat cervical spine conditions and a comprehensive physical therapy examination has been associated with more favourable outcomes. The cervical relocation test (CRT) is one method used to assess joint position sense (PS) integrity of the cervical spine. Previous research has found significant differences in the CRT between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Impaired kinaesthetic awareness in the cervical spine may be associated with degenerative joint disease, chronicity of the complaint and increased susceptibility to re-injury. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the intertester and intratester reliability of cervical relocation using the cervical range of motion instrument (CROM) and an affixed laser (AL) device among subjects with and without a history of neck pain. In addition, it was hypothesised that those individuals with a history of neck pain would have greater difficulty on the CRT. METHODS: A total of 50 asymptomatic subjects (n\,=\,50) were assigned to two researchers. The CRT was performed for each tester by the subject rotating the cervical spine for three trials to the right and left for the CROM and AL. RESULTS: The results indicate a significant intertester reliability of the CROM (interclass correlation coefficient (ICC)\,=\,0.717[0.502-0.839]; 0.773[0.595-0.873]) for the subjects in this sample. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the CROM is a reliable device for measuring cervical relocation between different testers. Future research should investigate if the CRT is predictive of prognosis in patients with cervical pathology.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aims of this systematic review were to identify the different versions of the Tampa Scale of kinesiophobia (TSK) and to report on the psychometric evidence relating to these different versions for people experiencing musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: Medline [Ovid] CINAHL and Embase databases were searched for publications reporting on the psychometric properties of the TSK in populations with musculoskeletal pain. Risks of bias were evaluated using the COSMIN risk of the bias assessment tool. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were included, mainly with a low risk of bias. Five versions of the TSK were identified: TSK-17, TSK-13, TSK-11, TSK-4, and TSK-TMD (for temporomandibular disorders). Most TSK versions showed good to excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass coefficient correlation 0.77 to 0.99) and good internal consistency (ɑ=0.68 to 0.91), except for the TSK-4 as its reliability has yet to be defined. The minimal detectable change was lower for the TSK-17 (11\% to 13\% of total score) and the TSK-13 (8\% of total score) compared with the TSK-11 (16\% of total score). Most TSK versions showed good construct validity, although TSK-11 validity was inconsistent between studies. Finally, the TSK-17, -13, and -11 were highly responsive to change, while responsiveness has yet to be defined for the TSK-4 and TSK-TMD. DISCUSSION: Clinical guidelines now recommend that clinicians identify the presence of kinesiophobia among patients as it may contribute to persistent pain and disability. The TSK is a self-report questionnaire widely used, but 5 different versions exist. Based on these results, the use of TSK-13 and TSK-17 is encouraged as they are valid, reliable, and responsive.},

  abstract = {AIM: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) admitted to a specialized rehabilitation unit in a regional hospital. A secondary aim was to identify patient characteristics and functioning that predicted changes in the PSFS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cohort study, 59 patients with ABI were assessed for the ability to complete the PSFS. A trained multidisciplinary team applied the PSFS as part of a collaborative development of rehabilitation goals. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS), the Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC), the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT), the Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment (NBAA) and the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) were used to identify characteristics of the sample. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between changes in the PSFS score from admission to discharge and a selected set of participant baseline characteristics and functioning. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (92\%) of the patients with ABI were able to complete the PSFS. The five (8\%) who were unable to complete the PSFS had severe cognitive or language impairment. The PSFS score improved by a mean of 2.6 (SD 2.0) points from admission to discharge. The LOTCA score made the strongest unique contribution to explain the change in the PSFS score (beta = 0.477, p= 0.020). CONCLUSION: In the present study, most patients with ABI (92\%) were able to complete the PSFS. Cognitive function on admission was a predictor of improved functioning on the PSFS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the validity, reliability, responsiveness, and interpretability of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) in subacute stroke rehabilitation to determine its suitability to measure patient-identified rehabilitation goals. METHODS: A prospective observational study was designed according to the checklist from Consensus-Based Standards for Selecting Health Measurement Instruments. Seventy-one patients diagnosed with stroke were recruited in the subacute phase from a rehabilitation unit in Norway. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health was used to assess the content validity. Assessment of construct validity was based on hypotheses for correlation of the PSFS and comparator measurements. We assessed reliability by calculating the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) (3.1) and the standard error of measurement. The assessment of responsiveness was based on hypotheses for the correlation of change scores between the PSFS and the comparator measurements. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to assess responsiveness. The smallest detectable change and minimal important change were calculated. RESULTS: Eighty percent of the PSFS items were classified as activities and participation in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, indicating satisfactory content validity. The reliability was satisfactory with an ICC of 0.81 (95\% CI\,=\,0.69-0.89). The standard error of measurement was 0.70 point, and the smallest detectable change was 1.94 points. Five of 7 hypotheses were confirmed for construct validity, and 5 of 6 were confirmed for responsiveness, indicating moderate construct validity and high responsiveness. Assessing responsiveness with a criterion approach resulted in an area under the curve of 0.74. A ceiling effect was identified for 25\% of the participants 3~months after discharge. The minimal important change was estimated to be 1.58 points. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates satisfactory measurement properties for the PSFS in individuals undergoing inpatient stroke rehabilitation. IMPACT: This study supports the use of the PSFS to document and monitor patient-identified rehabilitation goals in patients receiving subacute stroke rehabilitation when applied using a shared decision approach.},

There is a lack of evidence for its use with diverse pain populations who have high-impact chronic pain (HICP). The primary aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the PSFS with a heterogeneous sample of patients with HICP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study of prospective functional outcomes collected before and after participation in an intensive pain management program: PSFS, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, Lower Extremity Functional Scale, Neck Disability Index, Oswestry Disability Index, multidimensional patient impression of change, pain intensity, pain limitation, and fear-avoidance from the charts of 509 intensive pain management program completers. The reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the PSFS were analyzed using Cronbach {$\alpha$}, Pearson correlations, and receiver operating characteristics. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were found for all outcomes after program participation (all P {$<$} 0.0001). Correlations of the PSFS with similar outcomes (convergent validity) were lower than expected ( r = 0.16 to 0.33). A low correlation ( r = -0.12) with an unrelated measure, fear avoidance, supported divergent validity. PSFS change score correlations with similar outcome measures ranged from 0.46 to 0.53. The area under the curve values for the PSFS ranged from 0.801 to 0.857, suggesting a moderate ability for the PSFS to detect improvement. DISCUSSION: The psychometric properties of the PSFS showed mixed support for construct validity but good support for the responsiveness of the PSFS when used with a heterogeneous sample of patients with HICP.},

METHODS: Patients completed the PSFS, Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI), and numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) at baseline and follow-up, and were categorized as improved, stable, or worsened, using the global rating of change. Construct validity was assessed by comparing the change scores of the stable and improved groups, using independent-samples t tests. Reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1) with 95\% confidence intervals. Bland-Altman plots determined limits of agreement. Responsiveness and minimal important difference (MID) were determined with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: One hundred eighty patients met the inclusion criteria. Construct validity was supported for the PSFS and the UEFI (P{$<$}.001). Reliability was moderate to good for the PSFS (ICC2,1 = 0.713) and UEFI (ICC2,1 = 0.848). Reported estimates of reliability may be lower than true values because the group of "stable" patients from this cohort had, on average, a small positive change. Bland-Altman plots indicated good agreement. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was significantly different from the null value of 0.5 for the PSFS (0.887) and the UEFI (0.877), indicating good accuracy in distinguishing improved patients from stable patients. MID was 1.2 for the PSFS (scale, 0-10) and 8.5 for the UEFI (scale, 0-80). CONCLUSION: The PSFS is a valid, reliable, and responsive outcome measure for patients with upper extremity problems.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To identify, analyze, and synthesize the literature to determine which physical examination tests, if any, accurately diagnose a torn tibial meniscus. BACKGROUND: Knee pain has a lifetime prevalence of up to 45\%, and as many as 31\% of individuals with knee pain will consult a general practitioner. Roughly 5\% of these individuals will undergo a tibial meniscectomy and many more will undergo partial meniscectomy or meniscus repair. Determining which of these individuals is appropriate for surgical consult depends on clinical examination findings. METHODS AND MEASURES: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus from1966 to August 2006 and extracted all English- and German-language studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of individual physical examination tests for a torn meniscus. We retrieved data regarding true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives to create 2-by-2 tables for each article and test. Like tests were then subjected to meta-analysis and subanalysis. Cochran Q test and the 12 statistic were used to examine for the presence of heterogeneity and the extent of the effect of heterogeneity, respectively. A qualitative analysis was also performed using the QUADAS tool. RESULTS: Eighteen studies qualified for the final analyses. Three physical examination tests (McMurray's, Apley's, and joint line tenderness) were examined in more than 7 studies and had enough data to consider meta-analysis. However, study results were heterogeneous. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 70\% and 71\% for McMurray's, 60\% and 70\% for Apley's, and 63\% and 77\% for joint line tenderness. Large between-study differences could not be explained by prevalence, study quality, or how well an index test was described. CONCLUSIONS: No single physical examination test appears to accurately diagnose a torn tibial meniscus and the value of history plus physical examination is unknown. Differences between studies in diagnostic performance remain unexplained, presumably due to local differences in the way the tests are defined, performed, and interpreted. We recommend a more standardized approach to performing and interpreting these tests and the development of a clinical prediction rule to aid clinicians in the diagnosis of a torn tibial meniscus.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) is an individualized patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess the limitations and changes in self-determined functional activities most important to an older patient in the acute care setting. However, its clinimetric properties have not yet been evaluated in these patients. The study aimed to investigate the construct validity, test-retest reliability, sensitivity to change, and feasibility of the PSFS in acutely hospitalized older patients with and without cognitive impairment (CI). METHODS: The clinimetric properties of the PSFS were investigated by secondary data analysis from a prospective observational cohort study examining physical activity and mobility in acutely hospitalized older patients. In this analysis, 120 older patients-83.0 (6.4) years-with and without CI (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score 18-23, n = 52, and MMSE {$\geq$}24, n = 68, respectively) receiving early multidisciplinary geriatric rehabilitation in acute care were included. Construct validity was assessed by Spearman correlations (rs) with the Activity-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC-6), Short Falls Efficacy Scale-International (Short FES-I), EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), de Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI), and Barthel Index (BI); test-retest reliability within 24 hours by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs); sensitivity to change by standardized response means (SRMs) calculated for treatment effects, and feasibility by completion rates/times and floor/ceiling effects. RESULTS: The PSFS showed fair to moderate correlations with all construct variables in patients with CI (rs = 0.31 to 0.53). In patients without CI, correlations were fair for the ABC-6, FES-I, EQ-5D, and BI (rs = {\textbar}0.27 to 0.36{\textbar}), but low for the SPPB and DEMMI (rs =-0.04 to 0.14). Test-retest reliability (both: ICC = 0.76) and sensitivity to change (CI: SRM = 1.10, non-CI: SRM = 0.89) were excellent in both subgroups. Excellent feasibility was documented by high completion rates ({$>$}94\%), brief completion times ({$<$}8 min), and no floor/ceiling effects in either subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: The PSFS has adequate clinimetric properties for assessing patient-specific functional limitations and changes in acutely hospitalized older patients with and without CI. It might be an appropriate complement to traditional functional scales to enhance patient-centeredness in clinical geriatric assessment.},

Investigators have categorized this condition as vascular versus neurogenic, where vascular TOS can be subcategorized as either arterial or venous and neurogenic TOS can subcategorized as either true or disputed. The thoracic outlet anatomical container presents with several key regional components, each capable of compromising the neurovascular structures coursing within. Bony and soft tissue abnormalities, along with mechanical dysfunctions, may contribute to neurovascular compromise. Diagnosing TOS can be challenging because the symptoms vary greatly amongst patients with the disorder, thus lending to other conditions including a double crush syndrome. A careful history and thorough clinical examination are the most important components in establishing the diagnosis of TOS. Specific clinical tests, whose accuracy has been documented, can be used to support a clinical diagnosis, especially when a cluster of positive tests are witnessed.},

A comprehensive examination process, as described in Part 1 of this review, can reveal the bony and soft tissue abnormalities and mechanical dysfunctions contributing to an individual's TOS symptoms. OBJECTIVE: Part 2 of this review focuses on management of TOS. CONCLUSION: The clinician uses clinical examination results to design a rehabilitation program that focuses on correcting specific problems that were previously identified. Disputed neurogenic TOS is best managed with a trial of conservative therapy before surgical treatment options are considered. Cases that are resistant to conservative treatment may require surgical intervention. True neurogenic TOS may require surgical intervention to relieve compression of the neural structures in the thoracic outlet. Surgical management is required for cases of vascular TOS because of the potentially serious complications that may arise from venous or arterial compromise. Post-operative rehabilitation is recommended after surgical decompression to address factors that could lead to a reoccurrence of the patient's symptoms.},

OBJECTIVE: To summarize peer-reviewed literature on the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), and to identify its use as an outcome measure. METHODS: Searches were performed of several electronic databases from 1995 to May 2010. Studies included were published articles containing (1) primary research investigating the psychometric and clinimetrics of the PSFS or (2) the implementation of the PSFS as an outcome measure. We assessed the methodological quality of studies included in the first category. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-two articles published from 1994 to May 2010 were identified. Of these, 66 met the inclusion criteria for this review, with 13 reporting the measurement properties of the PSFS, 55 implementing the PSFS as an outcome measure, and 2 doing both of the above. The PSFS was reported to be valid, reliable, and responsive in populations with knee dysfunction, cervical radiculopathy, acute low back pain, mechanical low back pain, and neck dysfunction. The PSFS was found to be reliable and responsive in populations with chronic low back pain. The PSFS was also reported to be valid, reliable, or responsive in individuals with a limited number of acute, subacute, and chronic conditions. This review found that the PSFS is also being used as an outcome measure in many other conditions, despite a lack of published evidence supporting its validity in these conditions. CONCLUSION: Although the use of the PSFS as an outcome measure is increasing in physiotherapy practice, there are gaps in the research literature regarding its validity, reliability, and responsiveness in many health conditions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently available hand-held dynamometers (HHD) offer a more objective and reliable assessment of muscle force production as compared to a manual muscle test (MMT). Yet, their clinical utility is limited due to high cost. The ActivForce (AF) digital dynamometer is a new low-cost HHD with unknown psychometric properties, and its utilization may benefit clinical practice. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the AF intra- and inter-tester reliabilities, standard error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), and criterion validity for assessing shoulder isometric force as compared to the microFET2 (MF2) across testers with different experiences. DESIGN: Descriptive observational study. METHODS: A convenience sample of 29 healthy adults were assessed twice by each of three testers (two experienced clinicians and a novice PT student) on shoulder external rotation (ER), internal rotation (IR), and forward elevation (FE) using both the AF and MF2 devices. Tester, HHD, and shoulder motion assignment orders were randomized. All testing was performed in a standardized seated position. ER and IR were tested with the shoulder fully adducted. FE was tested at 45{$^\circ$} at the scapular plane. All testing and rest periods between testers and tested motions were standardized and monitored via a stopwatch. RESULTS: Both devices had high intra- [~ER (.95-.98), IR (.97 - .99), FE (.96 - .99)] and inter-tester [~ER (.85-.96), IR (.95 - .97), FE (.88 - .95)] intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with comparable intra- (1.68-1.80) and inter-tester (2.36-2.98) SEM, and intra- (4.64-4.97) and inter-tester (6.50-8.24) MDC values across all motions. Tester experience did not affect these values. High (.89-.93) statistically significant Pearson correlations were found between HHDs for all shoulder motions. CONCLUSION: Both the AF and MF2 HHDs were found to have high reliability levels across all shoulder motions regardless of tester clinical experience. The AF was also found to be valid for measuring shoulder isometric force production compared to the criterion standard device, the MF2. Its low-cost and electronic accessibility features may promote better compliance for clinicians using dynamometry to objectively assess and store muscle force data in a cost-effective manner.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adaptations in glenohumeral range of motion in overhead athletes lead to injuries of the upper extremity, specifically in the shoulder or elbow. DATA SOURCES: An electronic database search was performed using Medline, Embase, and SportDiscus from 1950 to 2016. The following keywords were used: GIRD, glenohumeral internal rotation deficit, glenohumeral deficit, shoulder, sport, injury, shoulder joint, baseball, football, racquet sports, volleyball, javelin, cricket, athletic injuries, handball, lacrosse, water polo, hammer throw, and throwing injury. STUDY SELECTION: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Of those 17 studies, 10 included specific range of motion measurements required for inclusion in the meta-analysis. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on demographics and methodology as well as shoulder range of motion in various planes were collected when possible. The primary outcome of interest was upper extremity injury, specifically shoulder or elbow injury. RESULTS: The systematic review included 2195 athletes (1889 males, 306 females) with a mean age of 20.8 years. Shoulders with GIRD favored an upper extremity injury, with a mean difference of 3.11{$^\circ$} (95\% CI, -0.13{$^\circ$} to 6.36{$^\circ$}; P = 0.06). Shoulder total range of motion suggested increased motion (mean difference, 2.97{$^\circ$}) correlated with no injury ( P = 0.11), and less total motion (mean difference, 1.95{$^\circ$}) favored injury ( P = 0.14). External rotational gain also favored injury, with a mean difference of 1.93{$^\circ$} ( P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: The pooled results of this systematic review and meta-analysis did not reach statistical significance for any shoulder motion measurement and its correlation to shoulder or elbow injury. Results, though not reaching significance, favored injury in overhead athletes with GIRD, as well as rotational loss and external rotational gain.},

BACKGROUND: The cervical rotation lateral flexion (CRLF) test is frequently used in clinical practice to determine whether a thrust manipulation targeting the first rib should be performed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the predictive validity of the CRLF test and manual examination in determining whether patients with neck pain are likely to benefit from manipulative treatment to the first and second rib. METHODS: A physical examination incorporating the CRLF test was performed on 50 participants with neck pain followed by manipulation treatment to the first and second ribs. Clinical improvement was assessed immediately and one week after treatment. Participants who experienced at least a 30\% improvement in their Neck Disability Index (NDI) score were considered "improved." Predictive validity was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive likelihood ratios. RESULTS: Neither the CRLF test nor manual examination were predictive of clinical improvement after manipulative treatment to the first and second rib. However, being male, of older age, and exhibiting T1 and/or T2 restricted end-feel were associated with improved neck related-disability at one-week follow-up. CONCLUSION: The CRLF test does not appear to be helpful in determining whether patients with neck pain are likely to benefit from manipulative treatment to the first and second rib. Other factors from the history and clinical examination may be more helpful when selecting manipulative treatment including age and gender and possibly the presence of T1/T2 restricted end-feel.},

  abstract = {The Rancho Los Amigos Scale (RLAS), also known as the Ranchos Scale, is a widely accepted medical scale used to describe the cognitive and behavioral patterns found in brain injury patients as they recover from injury. It was originally developed by the head injury team at the Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in Downey, California to assess patients emerging from a coma. It is often used in conjunction with the Glasgow Coma Scale during the initial assessment of a brain injury patient. However, unlike the Glasgow Coma Scale, it is used throughout the recovery period and not limited to the initial assessment. It takes into account a patient's state of consciousness as well as their reliance on assistance to carry out their cognitive and physical functions. The original scale consisted of eight levels, with level 1 representing the lowest level of function and level 8, the highest level of function. As a patient progresses to higher levels, they demonstrate improved cognitive and behavioral states and move toward greater independence. Individuals move through the different levels in a sequential pattern. However, the amount of time spent in each level and the maximum level achieved is variable among individuals. Individuals can also demonstrate an overlap of behaviors between two different levels and they can skip levels during their recovery. The original scale has since been revised and is known as the Rancho Los Amigos Revised Scale (RLAS-R). One of the limitations of the original eight level scale was that it did not accurately reflect the individuals with higher levels of recovery. Two more levels were added to the initial eight level Ranchos Scale to create a more comprehensive ten level scale named the Rancho Los Amigos Revised Scale (RLAS-R). Each level will be further described in detail below. Level I: No Response: Total Assistance:  No response to external stimuli ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~. Level II: Generalized Response: Total Assistance:  Responds inconsistently and non-purposefully to external stimuli. Responses are often the same regardless of the stimulus. Level III: Localized Response:~ Total Assistance:  Responds inconsistently and specifically to external stimuli. Responses are directly related to the stimulus, for example, patient withdraws or vocalizes to painful stimuli. Responds more to familiar people (friends and family) versus strangers. Level IV: Confused/Agitated: Maximal Assistance:  The individual is in a~hyperactive state with bizarre and non-purposeful behavior. Demonstrates agitated behavior that originates more from internal confusion than the external environment. Absent short-term memory.  Level V: Confused, Inappropriate Non-Agitated:~ Maximal Assistance:  Shows increase in~consistency with following and responding to simple commands. Responses are non-purposeful and random to more complex commands. Behavior and verbalization is often inappropriate, and individual appears confused and often confabulates. If action or tasks is demonstrated individual can~perform but does not initiate tasks on own. Memory is severely impaired and learning new information is difficult. Different from level IV in that individual does not demonstrate agitation to internal stimuli. However, they can show agitation to unpleasant external stimuli. Level VI: Confused,~Appropriate: Moderate~Assistance:  Able to follow simple commands consistently. Able to retain learning for familiar tasks they performed pre-injury (brushing teeth, washing face)~however unable to retain learning for new tasks. Demonstrates increased awareness of self, situation, and environment but unaware of specific impairments and safety concerns~. Responses may be incorrect secondary to memory impairments but appropriate to the situation. Level VII: Automatic, Appropriate: Minimal Assistance for Daily Living Skills:  Oriented in familiar settings. Able to perform daily routine automatically with minimal to absent confusion. Demonstrates carry over for new tasks and learning in addition to familiar tasks. Superficially aware of one's diagnosis but unaware of specific impairments. Continues to demonstrate lack of insight, decreased judgment and safety awareness. Beginning to show interest in social and recreational activities in structured settings. Requires at least minimal supervision for learning and safety purposes. Level VIII: Purposeful, Appropriate: Stand By Assistance:  Consistently oriented to person, place and time. Independently carries out familiar tasks in a non-distracting environment. Beginning to show awareness of specific impairments and how they interfere with tasks, however, requires standing by assistance to compensate. Able to use assistive memory devices to recall daily schedule. Acknowledges other's~emotional states and requires only minimal assistance to respond appropriately~. Demonstrates improvement of memory and ability to consolidate the past and future events. Often depressed, irritable and with low frustration threshold. Level IX: Purposeful, Appropriate: Stand By Assistance on Request:  Able to shift between different tasks and complete them independently. Aware of and acknowledges impairments when they interfere with tasks and able to use compensatory strategies to cope. Unable to independently anticipate obstacles that may arise secondary to impairment. With assistance able to think about consequences of actions and decisions. Acknowledges the emotional needs of others with stand by-assistance. Continues to demonstrate depression and low frustration threshold. Level X: Purposeful, Appropriate: Modified Independent~:  Able to multitask~in many different environments with extra time or devices to assist. Able to create own methods and tools for memory retention. Independently anticipates obstacles that may occur as a result of impairments and take corrective actions. Able to independently make decisions and act appropriately but may require more time or compensatory strategies. Demonstrate intermittent periods of depression and low frustration threshold when under stress. Able to appropriately interact with others in social situations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study's purpose was to investigate the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) for measuring mobility-related goals in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Data from 32 participants with MS who underwent 8 to 10 weeks of rehabilitation were analyzed (Expanded Disability Status Scale scores 1.0-7.0). For the PSFS, participants identified 3 mobility-related areas where they had difficulty and rated them at baseline, 10 to 14 days later (before starting intervention), and immediately after intervention. Test-retest reliability and response stability of the PSFS were calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2,1 ) and minimal detectable change (MDC 95 ), respectively. Concurrent validity of the PSFS was determined with the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) and the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (T25FW). PSFS responsiveness was determined using Cohen's d , and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was calculated based on patient-reported improvements on a Global Rating of Change (GRoC) scale. RESULTS: The PSFS total score demonstrated moderate reliability (ICC 2,1 = 0.70, 95\% CI: 0.46 to 0.84) and the MDC was 2.1 points. At baseline, the PSFS was fairly and significantly correlated with the MSWS-12 ( r = -0.46, P = 0.008) but not with the T25FW. Changes in the PSFS were moderately and significantly correlated with the GRoC scale ({$\rho$} = 0.63, P {$<$} 0.001), but not with MSWS-12 or T25FW changes. The PSFS was responsive ( d = 1.7), and the MCID was 2.5 points or more to identify patient-perceived improvements based on the GRoC scale (sensitivity = 0.85, specificity = 0.76). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of the PSFS as an outcome measure in people with MS to assess mobility-related goals.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A423 ).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine which hip provocation maneuvers best predict the presence of an intra-articular hip pathology. DESIGN: Prospective diagnostic study. SETTING: Musculoskeletal clinic at a university-based multispecialty group practice. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty subjects referred for intra-articular hip injection under fluoroscopic guidance. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were examined with 4 pain provocation maneuvers before and after anesthetic intra-articular hip injection administered under fluoroscopic guidance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Presence of intra-articular hip pain generator was confirmed by {$>$} or =80\% improvement on visual analog scale after intra-articular hip injection. RESULTS: The most sensitive tests were flexion abduction external rotation (FABER) test and internal rotation over pressure (IROP) maneuver. For the FABER test, sensitivity was 0.82 (95\% CI 0.57-0.96); sensitivity for the IROP maneuver was 0.91 (95\% CI 0.68-0.99). The most specific test was the Stinchfield maneuver, with specificity at 0.32 (95\% CI 0.14-0.55). FABER and IROP had the highest positive predictive value, with 0.46 (95\% CI 0.28-0.65) and 0.47 (95\% CI 0.29-0.64), respectively. IROP had the highest negative predictive value at 0.71 (95\% CI 0.25-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: IROP and FABER may be worthwhile components of the clinical evaluation of hip pain to determine intra-articular hip pathology. These tests are nonspecific and therefore not necessarily negative in the absence of intra-articular hip pathology. These hip provocation maneuvers are a useful part of an evaluation that includes history, further examination findings, and other diagnostic studies.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The shoulder manual resistance test is one of the common clinical assessments for patients with muscle weakness. However, there have been no studies investigating the threshold for muscle weakness. The purpose of this study was to clarify the threshold for muscle weakness in the shoulder manual muscle resistance test. METHODS: Fifty-three patients (37.9~{\textpm}~20.6~years old) with either rotator cuff tear (21 patients), superior labrum anterior-to-posterior (SLAP) lesion (7 patients), or Bankart lesion (25 patients) of one shoulder were administered three manual muscle resistance tests (abduction strength, external rotation, and belly press tests). Positive results in these tests were defined as a subjective weakness in the involved shoulder compared to the opposite shoulder. Based on this result, the patients were divided into positive and negative groups. Another observer measured isometric strength using a hand-held dynamometer and calculated the side-to-side ratio. Comparing instrument measurement with manual measurement, the cut-off point, at which we can recognise that there is a side-to-side difference, was calculated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: The cases with less than 60\% of the muscle strength in the contralateral shoulder were judged as positive in all examinations, whereas among the cases with 60-90\% of muscle strength, there was a mixture of negative and positive determinations. The cut-off point was 78.9\% in the abduction strength test, 73.8\% in the external rotation test, and 84.0\% in the belly press test. CONCLUSION: The side-to-side difference could be manually detected, when muscle strength was less than 75-85\% of that on the contralateral side. This finding suggests that it is necessary to understand the limitation of these manual tests in the case of clinical examinations. Therefore, care must be taken for the shoulder manual muscle resistance test as muscle weakness cannot be fully detected by manual measurement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case-control study, Level IV.},

We assess a short alternative, the Sickness Impact Profile 68 (SIP68), for retest and proxy reliability, validity, and scaling properties, in a population of adults with disability (PWD). For convergent validity, the SIP68 was compared to the instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), activities of daily living (ADLs) and the short-form 36 (SF-36). We completed 398 interviews with PWD, 131 index-proxy sets, and 40 retests. Retest intraclass correlations were above 0.75 for all scales and dimensions except the physical dimension (0.61). Proxy reliability ranged from 0.26 (psychological autonomy and communication) to 0.85 (somatic autonomy). Correlation between the SIP68 and SIP was 0.94 overall; between the SIP68 and similar scales of the SF-36 correlations was moderate, and highest for physical health scales. We repeated the SIP68 development factor analysis and reproduced a structure of the full SIP that included 65 of SIP68 items. However, 36 additional items were retained that are not part of the SIP68. Overall, the SIP68 shows promise for use as a disability outcomes tool.},

We included prospective measurement studies that reported on the psychometric properties (reliability, validity, responsiveness) of the PSFS in people with low back pain or pathology. We followed the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments 2018 guideline for systematic reviews. We performed both quantitative and qualitative syntheses in which the results were summarized on the basis of the reported measurement properties and study quality. Results: Ten eligible studies were included. The pooled PSFS reliability measure was excellent (intra-class correlation coefficient~=~0.89; 95\% CI: 0.75, 0.95). Validity measures displayed correlations that ranged from -0.47 to 0.69 when compared with other patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) or other tests. Eight studies had assessed the responsiveness of the PSFS. Effect sizes reported were large ({$\geq~$}0.91).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Generic upper extremity disability questionnaires utilize standardized items. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) allows the patient to identify specific self-reported items. This study evaluated the validity of the PSFS to assess outcome in patients with hand fractures or dislocations. METHODS: Adults with hand fractures or dislocations, who completed hand therapy between January 2012 and January 2013, were eligible for inclusion. At the initial and final assessment, each patient was asked to complete the PSFS. Each patient identified three items that were difficult or they were unable to perform, and the degree of difficulty was ranked from 0 to 10 (able to perform at pre-injury level). We excluded patients with an incomplete PSFS. Statistical analyses evaluated the relationships between the PSFS and the independent variables. RESULTS: There were 63 patients (37 men, 26 women); 21 of the 63 patients underwent surgery for fracture fixation. The mean duration of hand therapy treatment was 2.2\,{\textpm}\,1.4~months. The mean PSFS scores were as follows: initial 3.2\,{\textpm}\,2.2; final 8.1\,{\textpm}\,2.2. There was a significant improvement in PSFS scores from initial to final assessment (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and a moderate correlation (r\,=\,0.3, p\,=\,0.02). There was no statistical difference in PSFS scores between men and women or surgery and no surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with hand fractures or dislocations, the PSFS indicated significant improvement in function. Using items identified by the patient, the PSFS provides a valuable perspective of outcome and may be used in conjunction with generic disease-specific questionnaire for assessment of the upper extremity.},

DESIGN: Systematic review of a patient-reported outcome measure using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) guidelines. LITERATURE SEARCH: We searched 11 databases from January 2010 to July 2020 for articles on measurement properties or use of PSFS. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Published primary articles without language restrictions. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers screened all records, extracted data, and performed risk of bias assessments using COSMIN guidelines. We qualitatively synthesized findings for each measurement property in musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal conditions, and 2 reviewers independently performed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation assessments. This study was preregistered with the Open Science Framework (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/42UZT). RESULTS: Of the 985 articles screened, we included 57 articles on measurement properties and 255 articles on the use of PSFS. The PSFS had sufficient test-retest reliability in musculoskeletal (22 studies, 845 participants, low-to-moderate certainty) and nonmusculoskeletal conditions (6 studies, 197 participants, very low certainty), insufficient construct validity as a measure of physical function (21 studies, 2 945 participants, low-to-moderate certainty), and sufficient responsiveness (32 studies, 13 770 participants, moderate-to-high certainty). The standard error of measurement ranged from 0.35 to 1.5. The PSFS was used in 87 unique health conditions, some without prior evidence of validity. CONCLUSION: The PSFS is an easy-to-use, reliable, and responsive scale in numerous musculoskeletal conditions, but the construct validity of PSFS remains uncertain. Further study of the measurement properties of the PSFS in nonmusculoskeletal conditions is necessary before clinical use. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2022;52(5):262-275.

METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study was performed in a medical school and affiliated emergency medicine residency program setting. Participants included healthy adult volunteers without symptoms of TOS. The shoulder maneuvers AT, CCM, EAST, and SCP were performed in randomized order for 30 sec, 30 sec, 3 min, and 30 sec, respectively. Pulse quality and the presence and timing of pain or paresthesias were assessed. RESULTS: 53 subjects were enrolled, including 27 women, aged 29.7 +/- 6.4 years (range 21-58 years). AT, CCM, EAST, and SCP resulted in an altered pulse in 11\%, 11\%, 62\%, and 21\%; pain in 0\%, 0\%, 21\%, and 2\%; and paresthesias in 11\%, 15\%, 36\%, and 15\% of cases, respectively. The following outcomes had reasonable false-positive rates (upper 95\% confidence limit): pain with the AT (7\%), CCM (7\%), SCP (10\%), or any 2 TOS shoulder maneuvers (10\%); discontinuing the EAST because of symptoms (16\%); or any symptom with 3 (13\%) or 4 (7\%) TOS shoulder maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS: In a study of TOS shoulder maneuvers in healthy subjects, the outcomes of pulse alteration or paresthesias were unreliable in general. However, TOS shoulder maneuvers have reasonably low false-positive rates when a positive outcome is defined as pain after AT, CCM, or SCP; discontinuation of the EAST secondary to pain; pain in the same arm with {$>$} or =2 maneuvers; or any symptom in the same arm with {$>$} or =3 maneuvers.},

Useful clinical utility of these measures is necessary to support diagnostic imaging and subsequent surgical decision-making. OBJECTIVE: Summarise/evaluate the current diagnostic accuracy of various clinical tests germane to hip FAI/ALT pathology. METHODS: A computer-assisted literature search of MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE databases using keywords related to diagnostic accuracy of the hip joint, as well as the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the search and reporting phases of the study. Quality assessment of bias and applicability was conducted using the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Random effects models were used to summarise sensitivities (SN), specificities (SP), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and respective confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The employed search strategy revealed 21 potential articles, with one demonstrating high quality. Nine articles qualified for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated that flexion-adduction-internal rotation (pooled SN ranging from 0.94 (95\% CI 0.90 to 0.97) to 0.99 (95\% CI 0.98 to 1.00); DOR 5.71 (95\% CI 0.84 to 38.86) to 7.82 (95\% CI 1.06 to 57.84)) and flexion-internal rotation (pooled SN 0.96 (95\% CI 0.81 to 0.99); DOR 8.36 (95\% CI 0.41 to 171.3) tests possess only screening accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Few hip physical examination tests for diagnosing FAI/ALT have been investigated in enough studies of substantial quality to direct clinical decision-making. Further high-quality studies across a wider spectrum of hip pathology patients are recommended to discern the confirmed clinical utility of these tests.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this review was to investigate the reliability and validity of palpatory clinical tests of sacroiliac mobility. The secondary objective was to investigate which palpatory clinical tests of sacroiliac mobility exist in the literature. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Medline, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database were searched. There was no restriction on the study design or participants. The data extracted from each study were sample size, study deign, and clinical test used. If there was information on reliability values, number of examiners, concurrent validity values, gold standard used, or inferential statistical test used, that was also extracted. For intraexaminer reliability, the data were expressed as {$\kappa$} values that were meta-analyzed using random effects. RESULTS: Fifteen palpatory clinical tests of sacroiliac mobility were identified from 28 studies; 14 studies performed inferential statistical analysis, all including analysis of interexaminer reliability, with {$\kappa$} values ranging from -0.05 to 0.77. Analysis of intraexaminer reliability was performed in 8 studies, with {$\kappa$} values ranging from 0.08 to 0.73. No study included in this systematic review verified the concurrent validity of the tests. Our meta-analysis of intraexaminer reliability showed moderate to good agreement results for the Gillet test ({$\kappa$}\,=\,0.46), the standing flexion test ({$\kappa$}\,=\,0.61), and the sitting flexion test ({$\kappa$}\,=\,0.68). CONCLUSION: We found 15 palpatory clinical tests of sacroiliac mobility in this systematic review. According to our meta-analysis, only the sitting flexion test obtained a good and statistically significant intraexaminer agreement. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the reliability and validity of these tests.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the accuracy of the McMurray test in the adolescent and pediatric population. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Tertiary care, institutional. PATIENTS: Inclusion criteria included patients who presented with unilateral knee pain and were seen by pediatric sports medicine physicians. Patients were excluded if their knee pain was related to any underlying conditions. Three hundred patient charts were reviewed, and 183 patients (age range: 8-18 years, mean: 14 years; 74 male) met the inclusion criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Symptoms at initial visit (knee pain). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of a meniscal tear using the McMurray test. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent (160/191) of patients had a McMurray test documented as performed by the physician, and 17\% (27/160) elucidated a positive response. Of 26 patients who had a positive McMurray and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 16 (62\%) showed a meniscal tear on their MRI. However, of the 87 patients who had a negative McMurray and still underwent MRI, 25 (29\%) had a positive meniscal tear. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 39\%, 86\%, 62\%, and 71\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In a pediatric and adolescent population, the McMurray test was negative for 61\% (23/38) of meniscal tears identified on MRI. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although the test can be a useful tool as a part of a thorough evaluation, combining it with mechanical symptoms, patient history and imaging may be more helpful to diagnose a meniscus tear.},

  abstract = {The Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) is a neuropsychological test extensively used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute, well-known as the Stroop Effect. The aim of the present work is to verify the theoretical adequacy of the various scoring methods used to measure the Stroop effect. We present a systematic review of studies that have provided normative data for the SCWT. We referred to both electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar) and citations. Our findings show that while several scoring methods have been reported in literature, none of the reviewed methods enables us to fully assess the Stroop effect. Furthermore, we discuss several normative scoring methods from the Italian panorama as reported in literature. We claim for an alternative scoring method which takes into consideration both speed and accuracy of the response. Finally, we underline the importance of assessing the performance in all Stroop Test conditions (word reading, color naming, named color-word).},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Eliciting tenderness in the region of the ulnar fovea is a possibly useful clinical test for defining the source of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Until now, no reports of the clinical sensitivity and specificity of this test have been available. Based on anecdotal observations, a hypothesis was developed stating that ulnar fovea tenderness (positive "ulnar fovea sign") is sensitive and specific in detecting two ulnar-sided wrist conditions: foveal disruption of the distal radioulnar ligaments and ulnotriquetral (UT) ligament injuries. METHODS: The clinical records of 272 consecutive patients with wrist arthroscopy performed by the senior author from 1998 through to 2005 were reviewed. Relevant clinical and surgical data were abstracted. The ulnar fovea sign test is executed by pressing the examiner's thumb distally into the interval between the ulnar styloid process and flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, between the volar surface of the ulnar head and the pisiform. A positive ulnar fovea sign is designated when there is exquisite tenderness that the patient claims replicates their pain, with comparisons made with the contralateral side. RESULTS: There were a total of 90 foveal disruptions and 68 UT ligament injuries diagnosed during wrist arthroscopy. The ulnar fovea sign was positive in 156 patients. The sensitivity of the fovea sign in detecting foveal disruptions and/or UT ligament injuries was 95.2\%. Its specificity was 86.5\%. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis stating that the ulnar fovea sign is a useful clinical maneuver to detect foveal disruptions and UT ligament tears is supported. The conditions represent 2 common sources of ulnar-sided wrist pain. The differentiation between the 2 conditions may be made clinically, where UT ligament tears are typically associated with a stable distal radioulnar joint and foveal disruptions are typically associated with an unstable distal radioulnar joint. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic II.},

The processing methods of the electronic dynamometer-derived signal may influence the outcome measures. This study determined the influence of filtering and sample rate (SR) on isometric torque-time parameters and provides specific signal processing recommendations for future studies. Twenty-three subjects performed 49 isometric maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the knee extensors on an isokinetic dynamometer. Outcome measures included peak torque (PT), and rate of torque development at peak (RTDPEAK), 50 (RTD50) and 200\,(RTD200) ms for seven filter conditions including low-pass filter cutoffs at 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 150\,Hz and a notch filter at 100 and 200\,Hz. Comparisons were also made across four SR conditions at 100, 500, 1000 and 2000\,Hz. The RTDPEAK variable was markedly changed (-5.4 to -37.9\%) for all filter frequencies compared to the 150\,Hz condition and the RTD50 variable was altered for all frequencies between 50 and 5\,Hz. No differences were found for RTD200. For SR, compared to the 2000\,Hz condition, differences were revealed for the 100\,Hz condition for the RTDPEAK and RTD50 variables. The filtering or SR did not alter PT across any of the conditions. The filter and SR applied to the signal was capable of distorting the MVC signal and skewing the torque-time parameters, specifically for the early and maximum RTD variables of the MVC curve (RTD50 and RTDPEAK). For traditional isokinetic dynamometers, a low-pass filter cutoff of 150\,Hz and a SR of at least 1000\,Hz is recommended when assessing early isometric force- or torque-time MVC parameters.},

This study examines the reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale when applied to persons with neck dysfunction. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale and Neck Disability Index were applied at the initial visit, within 72 hours of the initial visit, and following 1-4 weeks of treatment in 31 patients with cervical dysfunction. At the time of the initial visit, the clinician made an estimate of patients' prognoses on a five-point scale. This estimate served as an priori construct for change: patients with better ratings would change more. The results demonstrate excellent reliability (R = .92) validity (r = .73-.83 compared with the Neck Disability Index, and r = .52-.64 compared with the prognosis rating), and sensitivity of change (r = .79-.83 compared with Neck Disability Index change scores, and r = .46-.53 compared with the prognosis rating). No difference was found between the Patient-Specific Functional Scale and Neck Disability Index in their ability to detect change over time. The results of this study are consistent with previous investigations which have concluded that the Patient-Specific Functional Scale is an efficient and valid measure for assessing disability and change in disability in persons with low back pain and knee dysfunction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Shoulder instability is extremely common, with various outcome scores used to assess its progression after treatment. This review was performed to identify the scores most commonly used and to evaluate them according to the 4 core domains of shoulder trials (according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [COMET] initiative) and their respective psychometric qualities. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature of 3 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed) was undertaken. Studies were identified using eligibility criteria and critically appraised by 2 authors. Data were extracted using an a priori template. Outcome scores were identified and assessed regarding COMET domain inclusion and their psychometric properties. RESULTS: The most frequently used scores were the Rowe (58\%), Constant (33\%), Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI; 24\%), and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (23\%) scores. The majority of outcome scores assessed pain and all assessed physical functioning. Quality of life and a global assessment of treatment success were rarely incorporated. No single outcome score considered all core COMET domains. The WOSI was the most acceptable measure of those assessed with respect to its validity, reliability, and responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The WOSI incorporated 3 of the 4 core domains for shoulder trials (pain, physical functioning, and health-related quality of life). It had the most psychometric testing of the identified scores, confirming its reliability, validity, and responsiveness in the setting of shoulder instability. We recommend its use in this setting; however, it should be supplemented with additional outcome scores, such as the University of California-Los Angeles score, to cover all of the core COMET domains.},

These factors make it well-suited to play a crucial role in influencing the appropriate patient progression through a rehabilitation program and assisting in determining return to play readiness following injury or surgery.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Determining the correct diagnosis can be challenging in patients presenting with hip pain. The physical examination is an essential tool that can aid in diagnosis of hip pathology. The purpose of this review is to provide an updated summary of recent literature on the physical exam of the hip, particularly as it relates to diagnosis of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, labral injury, and hip microinstability. RECENT FINDINGS: Physical exam findings consistent with the diagnosis of FAI include reduced supine hip internal rotation and positive flexion-adduction-internal rotation maneuvers. Labral tears can be detected on exam with the Scour test. Studies demonstrate altered hip biomechanics in patients with FAI during activities such as walking and squatting. Those with FAI have slower squat velocities, slower sit-to-stand tests, and increased hip flexion moments during ambulation. Hip microinstability is a dynamic process, which can occur after prior hip arthroscopy. For hip microinstability, the combination of the three following positive tests (anterior apprehension, abduction-extension-external rotation, and prone external rotation) is associated with a 95\% likelihood of microinstability as confirmed by examination under anesthesia at the time of surgery. A comprehensive hip physical exam involves evaluation of the hip in multiple positions and assessing hip range of motion, strength, as well as performing provocative testing. A combination of physical exam maneuvers is necessary to accurately diagnose FAI syndrome and labral pathology as individual tests vary in their sensitivity and specificity. While an elevated level of suspicion is needed to diagnose hip microinstability, the provocative tests for microinstability are highly specific.},

Concordantly, mapping paired values of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) and the bicarbonate concentration ([HCO3 -]) on a Cartesian coordinate system visually defines an acid-base disorder and validates the ratiometric methodology.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature Service System, VIP Database and CNIK from inception to February 2019. Two reviewers independently assessed articles' eligibility and risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-II (QUADAS-2). We used a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) model to conduct the meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy. RESULT: Twenty-four studies were included, involving 16 scales and 15,199 patients in intensive care settings. Results indicated that the top four risk assessment scales were the Cubbin \& Jackson Index (SEN~=~0.84, SPE~=~0.84, AUC~=~0.90), the EVRUCI scale (SEN~=~0.84, SPE~=~0.68, AUC~=~0.82), the Braden scale (SEN~=~0.78, SPE~=~0.61, AUC~=~0.78), the Waterlow scale (SEN~=~0.63, SPE~=~0.46, AUC~=~0.56). The Norton scale and the other eleven scales were tested in less than two studies and need to be further researched. CONCLUSION: The Braden scale, most frequently used in hospitals, is not the best risk assessment tool for critically ill patients. The Cubbin \& Jackson Index has good diagnostic test accuracy. However, low quality of evidence and important heterogeneity were observed.},
