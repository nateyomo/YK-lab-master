Tomorrow's best physicians will be those who continually learn, adjust, and innovate as new information and best practices evolve, reflecting adaptive expertise in response to practice challenges. As the first volume in the American Medical Association's MedEd Innovation Series, The Master Adaptive Learner is an instructor-focused guide that presents models used to train and teach future clinicians who need to develop these adaptive skills and utilize them throughout their careers. Explains and clarifies the concept of a Master Adaptive Learner : a metacognitive approach to learning based on self-regulation that fosters the success and use of adaptive expertise in practice. Contains both theoretical and practical material for instructors and administrators, including guidance on how to implement a Master Adaptive Learner approach in today's institutions. Gives instructors the tools needed to empower students to become efficient and successful adaptive learners. Helps medical faculty and instructors address gaps in physician training and prepare new doctors to practice effectively in 21st century health care systems. Written and edited by members of the ACE (Accelerating Change in Medical Education) Consortium - a unique, innovative collaborative that allows for the sharing and dissemination of groundbreaking ideas and projects - as one of the American Medical Association Change MedEd initiatives and innovations."--taken from back cover},

  abstract = {"Treatment of traumatic injuries is increasing in importance for physical therapists active in hospitals and private practice. In addition to the bone, joint, and soft tissue injuries incurred in sports, physical therapists are seeing more and more traumas associated with aging and with high-speed accidents. This great variety of injury types increases the complexity of treatment. Moreover, in recent years there has been a growing demand for the most complete restoration possible of both physical and psychological function. This is the principal objective of aftercare. Accordingly, this book focuses on a comprehensive presentation of individual injuries and their effect on function, as well as the guidelines and potential results of physical therapy treatment. It is addressed to students, practitioners, and teachers of physical therapy who must master and apply an understanding of the whole range of injuries, their consequences, and their treatment.

Indeed, one may find evidence of this phenomenon across the ancient world. For example, in Ayurvedic medicine, a system that developed in India approximately 3,000 years ago, the word "kampa" denoted tremor, and "kampavata" was an imbalance due to tremor [1, 2]. In the Edwin Smith Surgical papyrus, a medical-surgical case-based text that dates back at least to the middle Kingdom in Egypt, hieroglyphs denoting tremor or shuddering were used numerous times [1] (Figure 1). In Greece, the Aphorisms of Hippocrates contain the following reference to tremor - "when tremors occur in ardent fevers, they are terminated by delirium" [1]"},

Comprehensive in scope and concise in format, this reference describes the spectrum of injury from mild to severe and the continuum of care from initial injury to management of chronic sequelae. Chapters are designed with a practical clinical focus, for targeted retrieval of content by topic area and self-review. The text is organized into five sections. Part I addresses fundamental concepts necessary for understanding the underpinning of clinical decision-making. Part II is dedicated to mild TBI, including sport-related concussion, with chapters covering topics from natural history to associated somatic disorders, post-concussion syndrome, and PTSD. Part III covers moderate to severe TBI and details prehospital emergency and ICU care, rehabilitation, treatment of related conditions, and postinjury outcomes. Part IV focuses on TBI-related complications, including posttraumatic seizures, spasticity, behavioral and sleep disturbances, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Part V reviews special considerations in selected populations such as pediatric TBI and TBI in the military, as well as medicolegal and ethical considerations in TBI, complementary and alternative medicine, and return to work considerations. Each chapter includes boxed Key Points which underscore major clinical takeaways, Study Questions to facilitate self-assessment and further emphasize core chapter content, and an Additional Reading list for a deeper dive into chapter concepts. Significant updates incorporating recent advancements in the field, combined with the clinical acumen of its experienced contributors, make this third edition the essential manual for healthcare professionals caring for individuals with traumatic brain injury"--},
