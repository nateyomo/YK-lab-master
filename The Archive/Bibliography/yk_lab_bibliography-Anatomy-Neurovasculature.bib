  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our goal was to revisit the innervation of the adductor muscles of the thigh and add new evidence to currently existing knowledge. METHODS: Ten thighs from five fresh frozen cadavers were dissected. Obturator nerve innervation to the pectineus, obturator externus, adductor brevis, adductor magnus, adductor longus, and gracilis was documented. RESULTS: The adductor longus and gracilis were innervated by the anterior branch in 100\%, and the adductor magnus was innervated by the posterior branch in 100\%. The adductor brevis was supplied by both the anterior and posterior branches in 90\%. The obturator externus was innervated by the posterior branch in 60\% and a direct branch from the main trunk in 10\%. No innervation of the obturator externus by the obturator nerve was found in 30\%. CONCLUSIONS: The obturator externus and adductor brevis need to be explored further to clarify their innervation.},

  abstract = {The myotome of a muscle is the basis for diagnosing spinal and peripheral nerve disorders. Despite its critical importance in clinical neurology, myotome charts presented in many textbooks, surprisingly, show non-negligible discordances with each other. Many authors do not even clearly state the bases of their charts. Studies that have presented with raw data regarding myotome identification are rather rare. A classic study in the 19th century that pursued the nerve course in cadavers still has a substantial influence on existing charts, despite its definite limitations. Other scarce studies in humans include identification by root stimulation during surgery, clinical observations in root avulsion or spinal cord injury and clinical and electromyographical investigations in patients with single radiculopathies or certain plexopathies. A few recent studies have proposed new theories regarding the myotomes of some muscles. T1 innervation of the median intrinsic hand muscles is a typical example. We have added a number of new findings, such as T1 innervation of the forearm flexor muscles innervated by the median nerve except the pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis, C5 innervation of the brachioradialis, and two C6 indicator muscles, pronator teres and extensor carpi radialis brevis. Increased accuracy of the myotome charts will improve the localisation in neurology.},

  abstract = {Image-guided diagnostic block and radiofrequency ablation of the knee joint to manage pain require detailed understanding of joint innervation in relation to soft tissue and bony landmarks. In this article, the origin, course, and relationship to anatomic landmarks of articular nerves supplying the knee joint are discussed. The innervation pattern of the anterior and posterior aspects of the knee joint capsule is relatively consistent, with some variation in supply by the saphenous, anterior division of obturator, and common fibular nerves. To improve nerve capture rates for diagnostic block and radiofrequency ablation, multiple target sites could be beneficial.},
