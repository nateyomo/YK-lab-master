  abstract = {Chronic orchialgia can be the result of pathological processes of the scrotal contents or stem from non-intrascrotal structures. Successful pain management depends on identifying the source of localized or referred pain. This is a case report of a 39-year-old male sports coach who presented with low back pain, right orchialgia, and sciatica refractory to conservative management. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed disc protrusion at L3/L4 and L4/L5 levels. Positive outcomes in relieving back and testicular pain were obtained after a total of 30 chiropractic sessions over a 9-week period. The evidence of the subjective improvement was corroborated by regression of the herniated discs documented on the repeat MR imaging. While chronic orchialgia is not an uncommon problem for men of all ages, it has seldom been described in association with lumbar discogenic disease. The current study provided preliminary support for a link between orchialgia and lumbar disc herniation. Chiropractic manipulation had provided a mechanistic alleviation of noxious lumbar stimuli, leading to symptomatic and functional improvements.},

This allows the innominates to rotate slightly downwards on the sacrum with fixation and an apparent increase in the length of the legs, which in turn irritates the sciatic nerve. This commonly occurs bilaterally but may occur on just one side. Flexion of the innominate(s) on the sacrum restores function to the sacroiliac joint, causes an apparent shortening of the legs and gives excellent relief of pain in the low back and sciatic pain.J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 1979;1(1):23-35.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Evidence comparing the effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation is controversial. We sought to compare short-term and long-term effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment in sciatica symptom severity and quality of life in patients with lumbar disc herniation in a routine clinical setting. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of a routine clinical practice registry consisting of 370 patients. Outcome measures were the North American Spine Society questionnaire and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey to assess patient-reported back pain, physical function, neurogenic symptoms and quality of life. Primary outcomes were back pain at 6 and 12\>weeks. Standard open discectomy was assessed versus conservative interventions at 6, 12, 52 and 104\>weeks. We filled in missing outcome variable values with multiple imputation, accounted for repeated measures within patients with mixed-effects models and adjusted baseline group differences in relevant prognostic indicators by inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Surgical treatment patients reported less back pain at 6 weeks than those receiving conservative therapy (-0.97; 95\% CI -1.89 to -0.09), were more likely to report {$\geq$}50\% decrease in back pain symptoms from baseline to 6\>weeks (48\% vs 17\%, risk difference: 0.34; 95\% CI 0.16 to 0.47) and reported less physical function disability at 52\>weeks (-3.7; 95\% CI -7.4 to -0.1). The other assessments showed minimal between-group differences with CIs, including the null effect. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conservative therapy, surgical treatment provided faster relief from back pain symptoms in patients with lumbar disc herniation, but did not show a benefit over conservative treatment in midterm and long-term follow-up.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: In vitro force and deformation measurements formed the basis for determinate, quasistatic analysis of principal forces in the seated lumbar spine. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between seated postures and the mechanical response in component tissues of lumbar intervertebral joints. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite the high prevalence of low back pain syndrome, the precise mechanisms relating specific mechanical loads to spinal degeneration are not well understood. Simultaneous, time-dependent measurement of anterior column forces and articular facet forces has not been presented previously. consequently, a determinate analysis of principal component forces has not been possible. METHODS: Twelve lumbar spines (L1-S1) were subjected to constant loading conditions while in flexed and extended seated postures. Time-dependent forces were measured in the anterior column at the L4 and L5 superior endplates and in the four facets of the L3-L4 and L4-L5 motion segments. A quasi-static analysis of sagittal plane forces was used to compute the remaining principal joint forces, including ligament, disc shear, and facet impingement forces. RESULTS: Component forces changed under static loading in both postures. There were significant differences between the mechanical responses of the two postures. Although the vertical creep displacement was greater in the extended seated posture (3.22 mm versus 2.11 mm), the escalation of forces was more severe in the flexed posture. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a mechanism of force balancing in lordotic postures under static loads, whereas flexed postures produce large increases to the tensile forces in the region of the posterior anulus.},

  abstract = {[Purpose] This study aimed to examine the effects of pelvic movements on the back function of patients with lumbar disc herniation when lumbar stabilization exercise was applied to the patients, suggest an intervention method that can be used in future clinical therapies. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty patients with lumbar disc herniation underwent the intervention 30 minutes per day, three times per week for 4 weeks. Of them, 15 patients were assigned to the balance center stabilization resistance exercise group (experimental group I) and the other 15 were assigned to the three-dimensional stabilization exercise group (experimental group II). Before the intervention, disc herniation index was measured using magnetic resonance imaging, sacral angle was measured using X-ray, and back function was measured using the KODI. Four weeks later, these three factors were re-measured and analyzed. [Results] There was a significant pre- versus post-intervention difference in disc herniation index, sacral angle, and KODI in experimental group I and a significant difference in disc herniation index and KODI in experimental group II, and each group of disc herniation index and sacral angle had a significant difference. In experimental group I, each disc herniation index and sacral angle had a negative correlation. [Conclusion] The lumbar stabilization exercise, which controls balance using pelvic movements, improves mobility and stability of the sacroiliac joint; therefore, it increases pelvic and back movements. These kinds of movements not only improved proprioception sense, they also had positive effects on lumbar disc function recovery.},

Recent studies have measured the physiological effects of physical therapy interventions, including manual therapy and traction, on the intervertebral discs (IVD), and these findings may have implications for the long-term management or even prevention of low back pain. PURPOSE: The objective of this systematic review is to investigate the literature regarding possible physiological effects of physical therapy interventions on the intervertebral disc (IVD). STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Review. METHODS: A literature search of published articles through December 2014 resulted in the retrieval of 8 clinical studies assessing the influence of physical therapy interventions on the physiology of the IVD. RESULTS: Three studies, including two using animal models, investigated the effects of 30-minute intermittent traction on disc height. One in vivo animal study and two studies using human subjects assessed changes of disc height associated with static traction. Three studies investigated the effects of lumbar spine manipulation and mobilization on changes in water diffusion within the IVD. All studies confirmed, either directly or indirectly, that their respective intervention influenced disc physiology primarily through water flow. CONCLUSION: Physical therapy interventions may have an effect on the physiology of the IVD, primarily through water diffusion and molecular transport, which are important for the health of the IVD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most often diagnosed degenerative pathologies within the lumbar spine. Paraspinal muscle involvement could be a possible mediator in the pathophysiology of disc herniation and influences the course of pain and disability after both surgical or nonsurgical treatment. To potentially improve treatment, it may be important to assess multifidus muscle morphology in patients diagnosed with a LDH. OBJECTIVE: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis regarding the multifidus morphology in patients diagnosed with a LDH was conducted to assess the differences in multifidus muscle morphology between persons with LDH and healthy controls, and between the involved and the uninvolved side within subjects experiencing unilateral LDH. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of articles published up to and including November 2019 using the Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and MEDLINE Ovid search engines. The articles obtained from this search were screened based on title and abstract using the predetermined eligibility criteria. Included full text articles were assessed for their methodologic quality using the modified Downs and Black checklist. Heterogeneous data regarding multifidus muscle morphology was included in the descriptive analysis; data that was homogenous was included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified 3,176 articles. Based on the screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, 18 articles were included. Studies were either cross sectional or case-control studies assessing side-to-side differences or comparing patients diagnosed with a LDH to a healthy control group. Nine studies investigated whole muscle atrophy, six looked at muscle fat infiltration, seven studies assessed microscopic muscle properties including muscle fiber size, distribution, and muscle fibrosis. From the 18 articles, 10 were included in the meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, a comparison was made between side-to-side differences for muscle fiber size, distribution, and whole muscle size. Descriptive analysis showed increased fat infiltration and atrophy (muscle and individual fiber) of the multifidus muscle when comparing side-to-side differences or comparing cases to controls. Meta-analysis showed a significant decrease in type I and II muscle fiber size (p=.002, .01, respectively) combined with a significant increase in the number of type I muscle fibers (p=.008) at the side of LDH. Regarding whole muscle size, no significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the presence of ipsilateral multifidus muscle changes in persons with unilateral LDH.},
