Initial emphasis is placed on clinical history, examination, diagnostic testing, and medical decision making, while subsequent focus is placed on examining specific inflammatory optic neuropathies. Clinical clues, examination findings, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing that differentiate autoimmune, granulomatous, demyelinating, infectious, and paraneoplastic causes of optic neuritis are assessed, and current treatments are evaluated.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in technology and immunology have enhanced our understanding of the pathologies driving inflammatory optic nerve injury. Clinicians are now able to interrogate optic nerve structure and function during inflammatory injury, rapidly identify disease-relevant autoimmune targets, and deliver timely therapeutics to improve visual outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Optic neuritis is a common clinical manifestation of central nervous system inflammation. Depending on the etiology, visual prognosis and the risk for recurrent injury may vary. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of optic neuritis may be critical for limiting vision loss, future neurologic disability, and organ damage. This article will aid neurologists in formulating a systematic approach to patients with optic neuritis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The contribution of rods and cones to the pupillary light reflex has long been known. A third photosensitive cell type, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell, has recently been discovered. This cell type employs melanopsin to mediate a portion of the pupillary light reflex independent of rods and cones (the postillumination pupillary response) and photic regulation of circadian rhythm.                                         SUMMARY               The autonomic nervous system regulates pupil size in response to stimuli. The parasympathetic nervous system causes miosis in response to light and near visual stimuli. These stimuli activate supranuclear pathways that project to the Edinger-Westphal nuclei. The sympathetic nervous system causes mydriasis in response to a variety of arousing factors, both physiologic (wakefulness) and pathologic (pain). Abnormalities of physiologic function cause disturbances of pupil size, shape, and response to stimuli. The clinical approach to pupillary abnormalities should focus on the clinical and pharmacologic assessment of the pupil's expected response to diverse stimuli.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               ``Double vision'' is a commonly encountered concern in neurologic practice; the experience of diplopia is always sudden and is frequently a cause of great apprehension and potential disability for patients. Moreover, while some causes of diplopia are benign, others require immediate recognition, a focused diagnostic evaluation, and appropriate treatment to prevent vision- and life-threatening outcomes. A logical, easy-to-follow approach to the clinical evaluation of patients with diplopia is helpful in ensuring accurate localization, a comprehensive differential diagnosis, and optimal patient care. This article provides a foundation for formulating an approach to the patient with diplopia and includes practical examples of developing the differential diagnosis, effectively using confirmatory examination techniques, determining an appropriate diagnostic strategy, and (where applicable) providing effective treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent population-based analyses have determined that diplopia is a common presentation in both ambulatory and emergency department settings, with 850,000 such visits occurring annually. For patients presenting to an outpatient facility, diagnoses are rarely serious. However, potentially life-threatening causes (predominantly stroke or transient ischemic attack) can be encountered. In patients presenting with diplopia related to isolated cranial nerve palsy, immediate neuroimaging can often be avoided if an appropriate history and examination are used to exclude worrisome etiologies.                                         SUMMARY               Binocular diplopia is most often due to a neurologic cause. The onset of true ``double vision'' is debilitating for most patients and commonly prompts immediate access to health care services as a consequence of functional impairment and concern for worrisome underlying causes. Although patients may seek initial evaluation through the emergency department or from their primary care/ophthalmic provider, elimination of an ocular cause will not infrequently result in the patient being referred for neurologic consultation. A logical, localization-driven, and evidence-based approach is the most effective way to arrive at the correct diagnosis and provide the best outcome for the patient.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Paraneoplastic syndromes can affect the afferent and efferent visual systems. Paraneoplastic syndromes may result in reduced visual acuity from retinal degeneration, alterations in melanocyte proliferation and uveal thickening, or acquired nystagmus. Ocular motor abnormalities related to paraneoplastic syndromes may present with symptoms from opsoclonus or from neuromuscular junction disease. Diagnosis remains challenging, but serologic identification of some specific antibodies may be helpful or confirmatory.

Such pathology most often affects the anterior portion of the nerve and is visible on funduscopic examination. Ischemic optic neuropathy is associated with typical vascular risk factors and with one systemic disease in particular: giant cell arteritis (GCA). This article provides an overview of the three major classes of ischemic optic neuropathy, including information on risk factors, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Optical coherence tomography provides precise anatomic imaging in ischemic optic neuropathy, showing neural loss weeks before it is visible on examination. Refinements of optical coherence tomography reveal optic nerve microvasculature and may assist in understanding pathogenesis and verifying diagnosis. New diagnostic algorithms and cranial vascular imaging techniques help define the likelihood of GCA in patients with ischemic optic neuropathy. Finally, intraocular drug and biological agent delivery holds promise for nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, whereas newer immunologic agents may provide effective steroid-sparing treatment for GCA.                                         SUMMARY               It is essential to recognize ischemic optic neuropathy upon presentation, especially to determine the likelihood of GCA and the need for immediate steroid therapy. A broad differential diagnosis should be considered so as not to miss alternative treatable pathology, especially in cases with retrobulbar optic nerve involvement.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Modern ophthalmic imaging can be used to monitor the effects of diseases of the optic chiasm and tract on the retinal ganglion cells.

This article reviews the diagnostic criteria, clinical features, neuroimaging findings, differential diagnosis, and management options for this condition.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent population studies have found that the annual incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is increasing in association with obesity rates, whereas recent scientific studies indicate a possible role for androgen sex hormones and adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of the disease. Prospective clinical trials have demonstrated a role for weight loss, acetazolamide, and topiramate in the management of mild disease. A recently begun randomized multicenter trial of surgical interventions will provide insight into the indications for surgical intervention, optimal timing and choice of intervention, and long-term outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder producing symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of an alternative cause. The main goals of treatment are to preserve visual function and alleviate symptoms, which can usually be achieved with a combination of weight loss, medical therapies, and surgical interventions depending on the severity of symptoms and vision loss, response to treatment, and subsequent clinical course.},
