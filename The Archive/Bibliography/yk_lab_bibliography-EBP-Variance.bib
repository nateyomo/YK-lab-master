  abstract = {When several treatment methods are available for the same problem, many clinicians are faced with the task of deciding which treatment to use. Many clinicians may have conducted informal "mini-experiments" on their own to determine which treatment is best suited for the problem. These results are usually not documented or reported in a formal manner because many clinicians feel that they are "statistically challenged." Another reason may be because clinicians do not feel they have controlled enough test conditions to warrant analysis. In this update, a statistic is described that does not involve complicated statistical assumptions, making it a simple and easy-to-use statistical method. This update examines the use of two statistics and does not deal with other issues that could affect clinical research such as issues affecting credibility. For readers who want a more in-depth examination of this topic, references have been provided. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis-of-variance-by-ranks test (or H test) is used to determine whether three or more independent groups are the same or different on some variable of interest when an ordinal level of data or an interval or ratio level of data is available. A hypothetical example will be presented to explain when and how to use this statistic, how to interpret results using the statistic, the advantages and disadvantages of the statistic, and what to look for in a written report. This hypothetical example will involve the use of ratio data to demonstrate how to choose between using the nonparametric H test and the more powerful parametric F test.},

  abstract = {Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This fourth installment of Explorations in Statistics explores the bootstrap. The bootstrap gives us an empirical approach to estimate the theoretical variability among possible values of a sample statistic such as the sample mean. The appeal of the bootstrap is that we can use it to make an inference about some experimental result when the statistical theory is uncertain or even unknown. We can also use the bootstrap to assess how well the statistical theory holds: that is, whether an inference we make from a hypothesis test or confidence interval is justified.},

  abstract = {Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This series in Advances in Physiology Education provides an opportunity to do just that: we will investigate basic concepts in statistics using the free software package R. Because this series uses R solely as a vehicle with which to explore basic concepts in statistics, I provide the requisite R commands. In this inaugural paper we explore the essential distinction between standard deviation and standard error: a standard deviation estimates the variability among sample observations whereas a standard error of the mean estimates the variability among theoretical sample means. If we fail to report the standard deviation, then we fail to fully report our data. Because it incorporates information about sample size, the standard error of the mean is a misguided estimate of variability among observations. Instead, the standard error of the mean provides an estimate of the uncertainty of the true value of the population mean.},
