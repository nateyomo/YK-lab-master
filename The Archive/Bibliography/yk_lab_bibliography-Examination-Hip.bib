  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine which hip provocation maneuvers best predict the presence of an intra-articular hip pathology. DESIGN: Prospective diagnostic study. SETTING: Musculoskeletal clinic at a university-based multispecialty group practice. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty subjects referred for intra-articular hip injection under fluoroscopic guidance. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were examined with 4 pain provocation maneuvers before and after anesthetic intra-articular hip injection administered under fluoroscopic guidance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Presence of intra-articular hip pain generator was confirmed by {$>$} or =80\% improvement on visual analog scale after intra-articular hip injection. RESULTS: The most sensitive tests were flexion abduction external rotation (FABER) test and internal rotation over pressure (IROP) maneuver. For the FABER test, sensitivity was 0.82 (95\% CI 0.57-0.96); sensitivity for the IROP maneuver was 0.91 (95\% CI 0.68-0.99). The most specific test was the Stinchfield maneuver, with specificity at 0.32 (95\% CI 0.14-0.55). FABER and IROP had the highest positive predictive value, with 0.46 (95\% CI 0.28-0.65) and 0.47 (95\% CI 0.29-0.64), respectively. IROP had the highest negative predictive value at 0.71 (95\% CI 0.25-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: IROP and FABER may be worthwhile components of the clinical evaluation of hip pain to determine intra-articular hip pathology. These tests are nonspecific and therefore not necessarily negative in the absence of intra-articular hip pathology. These hip provocation maneuvers are a useful part of an evaluation that includes history, further examination findings, and other diagnostic studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgery for hip femoroacetabular impingement/acetabular labral tear (FAI/ALT) is exponentially increasing despite lacking investigation of the accuracy of various diagnostic measures. Useful clinical utility of these measures is necessary to support diagnostic imaging and subsequent surgical decision-making. OBJECTIVE: Summarise/evaluate the current diagnostic accuracy of various clinical tests germane to hip FAI/ALT pathology. METHODS: A computer-assisted literature search of MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE databases using keywords related to diagnostic accuracy of the hip joint, as well as the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the search and reporting phases of the study. Quality assessment of bias and applicability was conducted using the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Random effects models were used to summarise sensitivities (SN), specificities (SP), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and respective confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The employed search strategy revealed 21 potential articles, with one demonstrating high quality. Nine articles qualified for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated that flexion-adduction-internal rotation (pooled SN ranging from 0.94 (95\% CI 0.90 to 0.97) to 0.99 (95\% CI 0.98 to 1.00); DOR 5.71 (95\% CI 0.84 to 38.86) to 7.82 (95\% CI 1.06 to 57.84)) and flexion-internal rotation (pooled SN 0.96 (95\% CI 0.81 to 0.99); DOR 8.36 (95\% CI 0.41 to 171.3) tests possess only screening accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Few hip physical examination tests for diagnosing FAI/ALT have been investigated in enough studies of substantial quality to direct clinical decision-making. Further high-quality studies across a wider spectrum of hip pathology patients are recommended to discern the confirmed clinical utility of these tests.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Determining the correct diagnosis can be challenging in patients presenting with hip pain. The physical examination is an essential tool that can aid in diagnosis of hip pathology. The purpose of this review is to provide an updated summary of recent literature on the physical exam of the hip, particularly as it relates to diagnosis of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, labral injury, and hip microinstability. RECENT FINDINGS: Physical exam findings consistent with the diagnosis of FAI include reduced supine hip internal rotation and positive flexion-adduction-internal rotation maneuvers. Labral tears can be detected on exam with the Scour test. Studies demonstrate altered hip biomechanics in patients with FAI during activities such as walking and squatting. Those with FAI have slower squat velocities, slower sit-to-stand tests, and increased hip flexion moments during ambulation. Hip microinstability is a dynamic process, which can occur after prior hip arthroscopy. For hip microinstability, the combination of the three following positive tests (anterior apprehension, abduction-extension-external rotation, and prone external rotation) is associated with a 95\% likelihood of microinstability as confirmed by examination under anesthesia at the time of surgery. A comprehensive hip physical exam involves evaluation of the hip in multiple positions and assessing hip range of motion, strength, as well as performing provocative testing. A combination of physical exam maneuvers is necessary to accurately diagnose FAI syndrome and labral pathology as individual tests vary in their sensitivity and specificity. While an elevated level of suspicion is needed to diagnose hip microinstability, the provocative tests for microinstability are highly specific.},
