  abstract = {The recommendation to limit dietary saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake has persisted despite mounting evidence to the contrary. Most recent meta-analyses of randomized trials and observational studies found no beneficial effects of reducing SFA intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality, and instead found protective effects against stroke. Although SFAs increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in most individuals, this is not due to increasing levels of small, dense LDL particles, but rather larger LDL particles, which are much less strongly related to CVD risk. It is also apparent that the health effects of foods cannot be predicted by their content in any nutrient group without considering the overall macronutrient distribution. Whole-fat dairy, unprocessed meat, and dark chocolate are SFA-rich foods with a complex matrix that are not associated with increased risk of CVD. The totality of available evidence does~not support further limiting the intake of such foods.},

  abstract = {This article has been corrected. The original version (PDF) is appended to this article as a Supplement. BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence has continuously increased over the past few centuries and represents a major health burden worldwide. PURPOSE: To evaluate the possible causal relationship between intake of red and processed meat and cancer mortality and incidence. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest from inception until July 2018 and MEDLINE from inception until April 2019 without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies that included more than 1000 adults and reported the association between consumption of unprocessed red and processed meat and cancer mortality and incidence. DATA EXTRACTION: Teams of 2 reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias; 1 reviewer evaluated the certainty of evidence, which was confirmed or revised by the senior reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 118 articles (56 cohorts) with more than 6 million participants, 73 articles were eligible for the dose-response meta-analyses, 30 addressed cancer mortality, and 80 reported cancer incidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that an intake reduction of 3 servings of unprocessed meat per week was associated with a very small reduction in overall cancer mortality over a lifetime. Evidence of low to very low certainty suggested that each intake reduction of 3 servings of processed meat per week was associated with very small decreases in overall cancer mortality over a lifetime; prostate cancer mortality; and incidence of esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancer. LIMITATION: Limited causal inferences due to residual confounding in observational studies, risk of bias due to limitations in diet assessment and adjustment for confounders, recall bias in dietary assessment, and insufficient data for planned subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION: The possible absolute effects of red and processed meat consumption on cancer mortality and incidence are very small, and the certainty of evidence is low to very low. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None. (PROSPERO: CRD42017074074).},

Nutrients found in beef are associated with outcomes of wellbeing such as physical and cognitive function, lean body mass, and mood in older adults and individuals with chronic disease. However, it is unclear how beef and nutrients found in beef impact wellbeing in healthy adults {$\geq$}50~years of age. This study systematically reviewed evidence linking the intake of beef and nutrients found in beef to markers of wellbeing in healthy adults. PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched up to August 31, 2021 for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Nutrients included in the analysis were beef, red meat, dietary protein, essential amino acids, branched chain amino acids, tryptophan, arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, choline, zinc, and iron. We identified nine RCTs with results from 55 measurements of markers of wellbeing. An overall positive effect was found of beef and beef's nutrients on wellbeing. There was an overall positive effect of amino acids and protein on wellbeing, with no effect of arginine, vitamin B-12, leucine, and zinc. Physical function was also influenced by beef and nutrients found in beef. Eight of the studies found focused on specific nutrients found in beef, and not beef itself in older adults with one or more chronic diseases. This study identified a need for further research regarding the effect of beef and nutrients found in beef on defined functional outcomes of wellbeing in healthy adults {$\geq$}50~years of age.},

  abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of reducing dietary fiber on patients with idiopathic constipation. METHODS: Sixty-three cases of idiopathic constipation presenting between May 2008 and May 2010 were enrolled into the study after colonoscopy excluded an organic cause of the constipation. Patients with previous colon surgery or a medical cause of their constipation were excluded. All patients were given an explanation on the role of fiber in the gastrointestinal tract. They were then asked to go on a no fiber diet for 2 wk. Thereafter, they were asked to reduce the amount of dietary fiber intake to a level that they found acceptable. Dietary fiber intake, symptoms of constipation, difficulty in evacuation of stools, anal bleeding, abdominal bloating or abdominal pain were recorded at 1 and 6 mo. RESULTS: The median age of the patients (16 male, 47 female) was 47 years (range, 20-80 years). At 6 mo, 41 patients remained on a no fiber diet, 16 on a reduced fiber diet, and 6 resumed their high fiber diet for religious or personal reasons. Patients who stopped or reduced dietary fiber had significant improvement in their symptoms while those who continued on a high fiber diet had no change. Of those who stopped fiber completely, the bowel frequency increased from one motion in 3.75 d ({\textpm} 1.59 d) to one motion in 1.0 d ({\textpm} 0.0 d) (P {$<$} 0.001); those with reduced fiber intake had increased bowel frequency from a mean of one motion per 4.19 d ({\textpm} 2.09 d) to one motion per 1.9 d ({\textpm} 1.21 d) on a reduced fiber diet (P {$<$} 0.001); those who remained on a high fiber diet continued to have a mean of one motion per 6.83 d ({\textpm} 1.03 d) before and after consultation. For no fiber, reduced fiber and high fiber groups, respectively, symptoms of bloating were present in 0\%, 31.3\% and 100\% (P {$<$} 0.001) and straining to pass stools occurred in 0\%, 43.8\% and 100\% (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Idiopathic constipation and its associated symptoms can be effectively reduced by stopping or even lowering the intake of dietary fiber.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypercholesterolemia is a well-established risk factor for coronary heart disease, but the association between cholesterol level change and mortality is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the association of 2 year (2002-2003 to 2004-2005) change in cholesterol with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort study. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study population consisted of 269,391 participants aged more than 40 years who were free of myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort. Cholesterol levels were classified into 1st, 2nd and 3rd tertiles during each of the first and second health examinations, respectively. The participants were followed-up for all-cause and cause-specific mortality from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013. Compared to participants who stayed within the 2nd tertile group for cholesterol during both the first and second examinations, participants who became or maintained cholesterol levels to the 1st tertile during the second examination had increased risk of all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 1.28 (1.18-1.38) in 1st/1st, 1.16 (1.07-1.26) in 2nd/1st and 1.47 (1.32-1.64) in 3rd/1st tertile levels, respectively]. In addition, increased or persistent high cholesterol levels to the 3rd tertile was associated with elevated risk for all-cause mortality [aHR (95\% CI) = 1.10 (1.01-1.20) in 1st/2nd, 1.16(1.03-1.31) in 1st/3rd and 1.15(1.05-1.25) in 3rd/3rd tertile levels]. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in cholesterol levels in either direction to low cholesterol or persistently low cholesterol levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Particularly, spontaneous decline in cholesterol levels may be a marker for worsening health conditions.},

OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the effects of healthy diets that include small or large amounts of red meat on the maintenance of lost weight after successful weight loss, and secondarily on body composition (DXA), resting energy expenditure (REE; indirect calorimetry), and cardiometabolic risk factors. METHODS: In this 5-mo parallel randomized intervention trial, 108 adults with BMI 28-40~kg/m2 (45 males/63 females) underwent an 8-wk rapid weight loss period, and those who lost~{$\geq$}8\% body weight (n~=~80) continued to ad libitum weight maintenance diets for 12 wk: a moderate-protein diet with 25~g beef/d (B25, n~=~45) or a high-protein diet with 150~g beef/d (B150, n~=~35). RESULTS: In per protocol analysis (n~=~69), mean body weight (-1.2 kg; 95\% CI: -2.1, -0.3 kg), mean fat mass (-2.7 kg; 95\% CI: -3.4, -2.0 kg), and mean body fat content (-2.6\%; 95\% CI: -3.1, -2.1\%) decreased during the maintenance phase, whereas mean lean mass (1.5 kg; 95\% CI: 1.0, 2.0 kg) and mean REE (51 kcal/d; 95\% CI: 15, 86 kcal/d) increased, with no differences between groups (all P~{$>~$}0.05). Results were similar in intention-to-treat analysis with multiple imputation for dropouts (20 from B150 compared with 19 from B25, P~=~0.929). Changes in cardiometabolic risk factors were not different between groups, the general pattern being a decrease during weight loss and a return to baseline during weight maintenance (and despite the additional mild reduction in weight and fat mass). CONCLUSIONS: Healthy diets consumed ad libitum that contain a little or a lot of unprocessed beef have similar effects on body weight, energy metabolism, and cardiovascular risk factors during the first 3 mo after clinically significant rapid weight loss.},

The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the effects of egg consumption on inflammation. A systematic search of online databases (Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), Scopus, Ovid, PubMed, Cochrane) was used to gather clinical trials that assessed the effect of egg consumption on circulating inflammatory biomarkers. Using a random-effects model, pooled weighted mean differences (WMD) and corresponding standard deviations (SD) were calculated. Of the 21 eligible studies found, nine trials were eligible for analysis. Eight trials assessed high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), four trials assessed interleukin-6 (IL-6), and five trials assessed tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-               {$\alpha$}               ).

Coconut sugar is a healthier, sweetener option than the majority of other sugars that are commercially available. Sap is collected from trees to be transported, stored, and evaporated during processing, which are labor- and resource-intensive operations. Consequently, the cost of production is higher than it is for cane sugar. Given its high nutritional value and low glycemic index, people are willing to pay higher prices for it. However, one barrier is ignorance of its health benefits. This review examines and deals in-depth with the most significant features of coconut sugar chemical analyses to focus on several analytical methodologies given the increasing demand for naturally derived sweeteners in the last 10 years. A deeper understanding of the quality control, safety, health effects, nutritional profile, and sustainability issues corresponding to coconut sugar is necessary to effectively implement them in the food industry.},

In a handful of papers, associations between pesticides and NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicides and the organophosphorus herbicide glyphosate. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicide exposure. Despite compelling evidence that NHL is associated with certain chemicals, this review indicates the need for investigations of a larger variety of pesticides in more geographic areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which, despite producing a large portion of the world's agriculture, were missing in the literature that were reviewed.},

  abstract = {Glyphosate is an active ingredient of the most widely used herbicide and it is believed to be less toxic than other pesticides. However, several recent studies showed its potential adverse health effects to humans as it may be an endocrine disruptor. This study focuses on the effects of pure glyphosate on estrogen receptors (ERs) mediated transcriptional activity and their expressions. Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer, T47D cells, but not in hormone-independent breast cancer, MDA-MB231 cells, at 10{$^{-12}$} to 10{$^{-6}$}M in estrogen withdrawal condition. The proliferative concentrations of glyphosate that induced the activation of estrogen response element (ERE) transcription activity were 5-13 fold of control in T47D-KBluc cells and this activation was inhibited by an estrogen antagonist, ICI 182780, indicating that the estrogenic activity of glyphosate was mediated via ERs. Furthermore, glyphosate also altered both ER{$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} expression. These results indicated that low and environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate possessed estrogenic activity. Glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used for soybean cultivation, and our results also found that there was an additive estrogenic effect between glyphosate and genistein, a phytoestrogen in soybeans. However, these additive effects of glyphosate contamination in soybeans need further animal study.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Aims               Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading global cause of death. For decades, the conventional wisdom has been that the consumption of saturated fat (SFA) undermines cardiovascular health, clogs the arteries, increases risk of CVD, and leads to heart attacks. It is timely to investigate whether this claim holds up to scientific scrutiny. The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss recent scientific evidence on the association between dietary SFA and CVD.                                         Methods and results               PubMed, Google scholar, and Scopus were searched for articles published between 2010 and 2021 on the association between SFA consumption and CVD risk and outcomes. A review was conducted examining observational studies and prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, and long-term RCTs. Collectively, neither observational studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, RCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have conclusively established a significant association between SFA in the diet and subsequent cardiovascular risk and coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or mortality nor a benefit of reducing dietary SFAs on CVD rick, events, and mortality. Beneficial effects of replacement of SFA by polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat or carbohydrates remain elusive.                                         Conclusion               Findings from the studies reviewed in this paper indicate that the consumption of SFA is not significantly associated with CVD risk, events, or mortality. Based on the scientific evidence, there is no scientific ground to demonize SFA as a cause of CVD. SFA naturally occurring in nutrient-dense foods can be safely included in the diet.},

  abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of dietary fiber intake on constipation by a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946 to October 2011), Cochrane Library (2011), PubMed for articles on dietary fiber intake and constipation using the terms: constipation, fiber, cellulose, plant extracts, cereals, bran, psyllium, or plantago. References of important articles were searched manually for relevant studies. Articles were eligible for the meta-analysis if they were high-quality RCTs and reported data on stool frequency, stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and gastrointestinal symptoms. The data were extracted independently by two researchers (Yang J and Wang HP) according to the described selection criteria. Review manager version 5 software was used for analysis and test. Weighted mean difference with 95\%CI was used for quantitative data, odds ratio (OR) with 95\%CI was used for dichotomous data. Both I(2) statistic with a cut-off of {$\geq$} 50\% and the {$\chi$}(2) test with a P value {$<$} 0.10 were used to define a significant degree of heterogeneity. RESULTS: We searched 1322 potential relevant articles, 19 of which were retrieved for further assessment, 14 studies were excluded for various reasons, five studies were included in the analysis. Dietary fiber showed significant advantage over placebo in stool frequency (OR = 1.19; 95\%CI: 0.58-1.80, P {$<$} 0.05). There was no significant difference in stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and painful defecation between the two groups. Stool frequency were reported by five RCTs, all results showed either a trend or a significant difference in favor of the treatment group, number of stools per week increased in treatment group than in placebo group (OR = 1.19; 95\%CI: 0.58-1.80, P {$<$} 0.05), with no significant heterogeneity among studies (I(2)= 0, P = 0.77). Four studies evaluated stool consistency, one of them presented outcome in terms of percentage of hard stool, which was different from others, so we included the other three studies for analysis. Two studies reported treatment success. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (P {$<$} 0.1, I(2) {$>$} 50\%). Three studies reported laxative use, quantitative data was shown in one study, and the pooled analysis of the other two studies showed no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups in laxative use (OR = 1.07; 95\%CI 0.51-2.25), and no heterogeneity was found (P = 0.84, I(2)= 0). Three studies evaluated painful defecation: one study presented both quantitative and dichotomous data, the other two studies reported quantitative and dichotomous data separately. We used dichotomous data for analysis. CONCLUSION: Dietary fiber intake can obviously increase stool frequency in patients with constipation. It does not obviously improve stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and painful defecation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between a plant-based diet (vegetarianism) and extended life span is increasingly criticised since it may be based on the lack of representative data and insufficient removal of confounders such as lifestyles. AIM: We examined the association between meat intake and life expectancy at a population level based on ecological data published by the United Nations agencies. METHODS: Population-specific data were obtained from 175 countries/territories. Scatter plots, bivariate, partial correlation and linear regression models were used with SPSS 25 to explore and compare the correlations between newborn life expectancy (e(0)), life expectancy at 5 years of life (e(5)) and intakes of meat, and carbohydrate crops, respectively. The established risk factors to life expectancy - caloric intake, urbanization, obesity and education levels - were included as the potential confounders. RESULTS: Worldwide, bivariate correlation analyses revealed that meat intake is positively correlated with life expectancies. This relationship remained significant when influences of caloric intake, urbanization, obesity, education and carbohydrate crops were statistically controlled. Stepwise linear regression selected meat intake, not carbohydrate crops, as one of the significant predictors of life expectancy. In contrast, carbohydrate crops showed weak and negative correlation with life expectancy. CONCLUSION: If meat intake is not incorporated into nutrition science for predicting human life expectancy, results could prove inaccurate.},
