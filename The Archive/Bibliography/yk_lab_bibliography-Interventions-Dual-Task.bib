  abstract = {Older adults' difficulties in performing two tasks concurrently have been well documented (Kramer \& Madden, 2008). It has been observed that the age-related differences in dual-task performance are larger when the two tasks require similar motor responses (2001) and that in some conditions older adults also show greater susceptibility than younger adults to input interference (Hein \& Schubert, 2004). The authors recently observed that even when the two tasks require motor responses, both older and younger adults can learn to perform a visual discrimination task and an auditory discrimination task faster and more accurately (Bherer et al., 2005). In the present study, the authors extended this finding to a dual-task condition that involves two visual tasks requiring two motor responses. Older and younger adults completed a dual-task training program in which continuous individualized adaptive feedback was provided to enhance performance. The results indicate that, even with similar motor responses and two visual stimuli, both older and younger adults showed substantial gains in performance after training and that the improvement generalized to new task combinations involving new stimuli. These results suggest that dual-task skills can be substantially improved in older adults and that cognitive plasticity in attentional control is still possible in old age.},

  abstract = {Dual-process and dual-system theories in both cognitive and social psychology have been subjected to a number of recently published criticisms. However, they have been attacked as a category, incorrectly assuming there is a generic version that applies to all. We identify and respond to 5 main lines of argument made by such critics. We agree that some of these arguments have force against some of the theories in the literature but believe them to be overstated. We argue that the dual-processing distinction is supported by much recent evidence in cognitive science. Our preferred theoretical approach is one in which rapid autonomous processes (Type 1) are assumed to yield default responses unless intervened on by distinctive higher order reasoning processes (Type 2). What defines the difference is that Type 2 processing supports hypothetical thinking and load heavily on working memory.},

  abstract = {Athletes must distribute their attention to many relevant cues during a match. Therefore, athletes' ability to deal with dual-tasks may be different from the non-athlete population, demanding a deeper investigation within the sports domain. This study aimed to systematically review the acute and chronic effects of dual-tasks in motor and cognitive performances in athletes from different modalities. The search for articles followed all the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The keywords used were: ``dual-task'' OR ``double task'' OR ``multi-task'' OR ``divided attention'' OR ``secondary task'' OR ``second task'' AND ``working memory'' OR ``visual'' OR ``decision making'' OR ``gaze behavior'' OR ``attention'' AND ``sports'' OR ``athletes'' OR ``players''. The Scopus, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases were screened for studies comparing single and dual-tasks, in which the participants were athletes competing at any level, and in which at least one of the following variables were investigated: working memory, decision-making, visual search behavior, perception, anticipation, attention, or motor tasks. Articles were screened using pre-defined selection criteria, and methodological quality was assessed by two researchers independently. Following the eligibility criteria, we included 18 articles in the review: 13 on the acute effects, and five on the chronic effects. This review showed that the acute effect of dual-tasks impairs the motor and cognitive performances of athletes (dual-task cost). However, training with dual-tasks (chronic effect) improved working memory skills and attentional control. We conclude that dual-tasks acutely and chronically impacts motor and cognitive performance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several systematic reviews have evaluated the role of dual-task assessment in individuals with concussion. However, no systematic reviews to date have investigated dual-task protocols with implications for individuals with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury or ACL reconstruction (ACLR). PURPOSE: To systematically review the evidence on dual-task assessment practices applicable to those with ACL deficiency/ACLR, specifically with the aim to identify motor-cognitive performance costs. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic literature review was undertaken on those with ACL-deficient or ACL-reconstructed knees performing dual-task activities. The following databases were searched from inception to June 8, 2018 including CINAHL, PsychInfo, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and gray literature. Three primary search categories (knee, cognition, and motor task) were included. Only one reviewer independently performed the database search, data extraction, and scored each article for quality. All studies were assessed for quality and pertinent data were extracted, examined and synthesized. RESULTS: Ten studies were included for analysis, all of which were published within the prior ten years. Performance deficits were identified in those with either ACL deficiency or ACLR while dual-tasking, such as prioritization of postural control at the expense of cognitive performance, impaired postural control in single limb stance, greater number of cognitive errors, and increased step width coefficient of variation while walking. No studies examined those with prior ACL injury or ACLR during tasks that mimicked ACL injury mechanisms such as jump-landing or single-leg cutting. CONCLUSION: The results of the current systematic review suggests that postural control, gait, and/or cognitive deficits exist when evaluated under a dual-task paradigm in those with ACL deficiency or ACLR. This systematic review highlights the need for future research on dual-task assessment for individuals who have sustained an ACL injury or undergone ACLR, specifically utilizing more difficult athletic movements. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3a.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate whether performance in a multiple object tracking (MOT) task could be improved incrementally with sports expertise, and whether differences between experienced and less experienced athletes, or non-athletes, were modulated by load. METHODS: We asked 22 elite and 20 intermediate basketball players, and 23 non-athletes, to perform an MOT task under three attentional load conditions (two, three, and four targets). Accuracies were analyzed to examine whether different levels of sports expertise influence MOT task performance. RESULTS: The elite athletes displayed better tracking performance compared with the intermediate or non-athletes when tracking three or four targets. However, no significant difference was found between the intermediate athletes and the non-athletes. Further, no differences were observed among the three groups when tracking two targets. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the effects of expertise in team ball sports could transfer to a non-sports-specific attention task. These transfer effects to general cognitive functions occur only in elite athletes with extensive training under higher attentional load.},

  abstract = {The Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) is a neuropsychological test extensively used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute, well-known as the Stroop Effect. The aim of the present work is to verify the theoretical adequacy of the various scoring methods used to measure the Stroop effect. We present a systematic review of studies that have provided normative data for the SCWT. We referred to both electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar) and citations. Our findings show that while several scoring methods have been reported in literature, none of the reviewed methods enables us to fully assess the Stroop effect. Furthermore, we discuss several normative scoring methods from the Italian panorama as reported in literature. We claim for an alternative scoring method which takes into consideration both speed and accuracy of the response. Finally, we underline the importance of assessing the performance in all Stroop Test conditions (word reading, color naming, named color-word).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomechanical analyses suggest that the loss of neuromuscular control is associated with noncontact anterior cruciate ligament sprains; however, previous research has not explored the link between neurocognitive function and unintentional knee injuries. PURPOSE: To determine if athletes who suffer a noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury demonstrate decreased baseline neurocognitive performance when compared with matched controls. STUDY DESIGN: Case control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The baseline scores from a computerized neurocognitive test battery (ImPACT) were analyzed to compare verbal memory, visual memory, processing speed, and reaction time. Eighty intercollegiate athletes who, subsequent to testing, experienced noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries, were matched with 80 controls based on height, weight, age, gender, sport, position, and years of experience at the collegiate level. RESULTS: Statistical differences were found between the noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury group and the matched controls on all 4 neurocognitive subtests. Noncontact anterior cruciate ligament-injured athletes demonstrated significantly slower reaction time (F(1,158) = 9.66, P = .002) and processing speed (F(1,158) = 12.04, P = .001) and performed worse on visual (F(1,158) = 19.16, P = .000) and verbal memory (F(1,158) = 4.08, P = .045) composite scores when compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Neurocognitive differences may be associated with the loss of neuromuscular control and coordination errors, predisposing certain intercollegiate athletes to noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries.},
