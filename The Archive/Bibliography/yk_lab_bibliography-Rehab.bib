  abstract = {CONTEXT: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) and postoperative rehabilitation continues to be a multidisciplinary focus in both research and clinical environments. Recent research on ACLR warrants a reexamination of clinicians' current rehabilitation practices to optimize the strikingly variable clinical outcomes after ACLR and return to sport. The purpose of the article and updated guidelines is to use contemporary evidence to systematically revisit our practice guidelines and validate our clinical milestones with data from our university-based practice. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Using the PubMed search engine, articles that reported on ACLR rehabilitation and protocols, guidelines, graft type, healing and strain, return to sport, psychological considerations, and secondary injury prevention published from 1979 to 2020 were identified using the search terms ACLR protocols, guidelines, ACLR rehabilitation, ACL graft, ACL open kinetic chain (OKC) exercise and closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercise, ACLR return to sport, ACLR psychological factors, and ACL injury prevention. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5. RESULTS: Clinical milestones after ACLR were validated using clinical data collected from 2013 to 2017 at a university-based practice. Variables including knee joint range of motion, effusion, Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale, and quadriceps strength index were tracked throughout rehabilitation and analyzed to help inform an updated ACLR rehabilitation guideline. CONCLUSION: Incorporating the latest research, combined with direct clinical data, provides a current, realistic, and clinically benchmarked strategy for ACLR rehabilitation. Commonly held clinical beliefs regarding rehabilitation after ACL injury must be challenged by the latest research to improve patient outcomes and decrease the risk of reinjury. Key updates to the practice guidelines include the use of frequent and accurate quadriceps strength testing, delayed return-to-sport timeline, immediate use of open kinetic chain exercise, criterion-based progressions for running, sprinting, plyometrics, agility, cutting/pivoting, return to competition, and the inclusion of a secondary prevention program after return to sport.

Various anatomical and functional predispositions combine with abrupt changes in mechanical loading to cause characteristic histological maladaptations in tendons. The nature and latency of cellular changes in tendinopathy makes many common treatments less-than-optimal options. This Perspective presents the EdUReP model for nonsurgical management of tendinopathy, a model that considers sources of pathology at the cellular, anatomical, and functional levels. The EdUReP model addresses possible sources of symptoms at the levels of pathology, impairment, functional limitation, and disability through Educational interventions, periods of tendon Unloading and controlled Reloading, and implementation of Prevention strategies. The EdUReP model is an evidence-based treatment construct that aims to reduce functional limitation and disability through amelioration of tissue pathology.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether fear of re-injury is manifested in joint kinematics and muscle activation patterns during landings of a standardized rebound side-hop (SRSH), or in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), among individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, 38 individuals within 2 years post-ACLR were grouped into HIGH-FEAR (n = 21, median 11.2 months post-surgery) or LOW-FEAR (n = 17, median 10.1 months post-surgery) based on a discriminating question (Q9; Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-17). These individuals and 39 asymptomatic controls performed the SRSH. Three-dimensional motion recordings were used to calculate trunk, hip, and knee joint angles at initial contact and range of respective joint motion during landing. Surface electromyography registered mean amplitudes and co-contraction indexes for thigh muscles during pre-activation (50 ms) and landing phases. PROMs of knee function, knee health, and physical activity were also analyzed. RESULTS: The HIGH-FEAR and LOW-FEAR classification was corroborated by distinct Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-17 total and subscale scores and revealed distinguishable muscle activation patterns. HIGH-FEAR demonstrated higher biceps femoris electromyography amplitude and higher anterior-posterior co-contraction index during landing than both LOW-FEAR and controls. However, there were no fear-related differences for kinematics or PROMs. Instead, both ACLR subgroups showed different kinematics at initial contact to controls; HIGH-FEAR with more trunk, hip, and knee flexion, and LOW-FEAR with more hip and knee flexion. CONCLUSION: Individuals with ACLR who had high fear of re-injury seem to have adopted a protective strategy with higher muscular activation patterns, presumably to stabilize the knee joint, compared with individuals with low fear of re-injury and controls. SRSH landing kinematics or knee-related PROMs may not be as sensitive to fear of re-injury. IMPACT: Fear of reinjury following anterior cruciate ligament injury should be evaluated as an independent psychological outcome throughout rehabilitation after ACLR for improved return to sport transition. LAY SUMMARY: If you have an anterior cruciate ligament injury treated with reconstructive surgery, you might have a high fear of reinjury, and that can change how you activate the muscles around your knee. Your physical therapist can do a simple screening test in addition to functional tests to help reduce your fear and improve your treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {Achilles Tendinopathy is a complex problem, with the most common conservative treatment being eccentric exercises. Despite multiple studies assessing this treatment regime little is known about the mechanism of effect. This lack of understanding may be hindering therapeutic care and preventing optimal rehabilitation. Of the mechanisms proposed, most relate to tendon adaptation and fail to consider other possibilities. The current consensus is that tendon adaptation does not occur within timeframes associated with clinical improvements, therefore the clinical benefits must occur through another unidentified pathway. This clinical commentary critically reviews each of the proposed theories and highlights that muscle alterations are observed prior to onset of Achilles Tendinopathy and during the disease. Evidence shows that the observed muscle alterations change with treatment and that these adaptations have the ability to reduce tendon load and thereby improve tendon health. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to review previous theories regarding the mechanisms by which eccentric exercise might affect Achilles tendinopathy and offers a novel mechanism by which the plantarflexor muscles may shield the Achilles tendon.

  abstract = {Study Design Prospective cohort. Background The high risk of second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries after return to sport highlights the importance of return-to-sport decision making. Objective return-to-sport criteria frequently use limb symmetry indexes (LSIs) to quantify quadriceps strength and hop scores. Whether using the uninvolved limb in LSIs is optimal is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the uninvolved limb as a reference standard for LSIs utilized in return-to-sport testing and its relationship with second ACL injury rates. Methods Seventy athletes completed quadriceps strength and 4 single-leg hop tests before anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and 6 months after ACLR. Limb symmetry indexes for each test compared involved-limb measures at 6 months to uninvolved-limb measures at 6 months. Estimated preinjury capacity (EPIC) levels for each test compared involved-limb measures at 6 months to uninvolved-limb measures before ACLR. Second ACL injuries were tracked for a minimum follow-up of 2 years after ACLR. Results Forty (57.1\%) patients achieved 90\% LSIs for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. Only 20 (28.6\%) patients met 90\% EPIC levels (comparing the involved limb at 6 months after ACLR to the uninvolved limb before ACLR) for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. Twenty-four (34.3\%) patients who achieved 90\% LSIs for all measures 6 months after ACLR did not achieve 90\% EPIC levels for all measures. Estimated preinjury capacity levels were more sensitive than LSIs in predicting second ACL injuries (LSIs, 0.273; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.010, 0.566 and EPIC, 0.818; 95\% CI: 0.523, 0.949). Conclusion Limb symmetry indexes frequently overestimate knee function after ACLR and may be related to second ACL injury risk. These findings raise concern about whether the variable ACL return-to-sport criteria utilized in current clinical practice are stringent enough to achieve safe and successful return to sport.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed, accounting for over 200,000 cases annually. Despite the high prevalence, there is still much debate as to the optimal graft choice. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current literature and discuss the reported outcomes for the most common graft choices. RECENT FINDINGS: The most common autografts being used include bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), hamstring tendon (HT), and quadriceps tendon (QT). Hamstring tendon might have a slightly higher re-tear rate when compared with BPTB (2.84 versus 2.80). However, BPTB has a higher rate of anterior knee and kneeling pain in the short- and mid-term follow-up. This has not been shown to be the case in long-term follow-up. Allograft is a viable option for revisions and primaries in patients greater than 35~years old; however, re-tear rate increases significantly in younger patients. ACL reconstruction graft choice is a highly studied and yet still exceedingly debated topic. Most large studies report either no significant difference or a small difference in failure rate and outcome scores between the different autograft choices. Allografts have been demonstrated to have an increased risk of failure in younger athletes and should be reserved for revision cases and those aged 35~years and older. Graft choice should ultimately be decided upon based on surgeon comfort and experience and individual patient characteristics.},
