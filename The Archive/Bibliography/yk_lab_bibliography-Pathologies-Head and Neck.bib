  abstract = {In young adult, the most common etiology of acute ischemic brain infarction are arterial dissections and cardiogenic embolic stroke. Vertebral artery dissection without preceding trauma history is quite rare in young ischemic stroke patients. Postural headache is even more atypical presentation for vertebral artery dissection. It is often misdiagnosed as spontaneous intracranial hypotension. We described a 37-year-old male suffering from acute onset postural headache with stroke in evolution during hospitalization. The initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mislead to diagnosis of ischemic lesion. Nevertheless, with the aid of single photon emission computed tomography, we are confident the patient was afflicted with ischemic/hemorrhagic lesion, instead of neoplasm or demyelinating diseases. Lateral medullary syndrome was confirmed on the repeated brain MRI. His general condition improved with steady gait and clear articulation without easychoking after adequate hydration and rehabilitation training with aspirin as secondary prevention. Cranial artery dissections is a crucial differential diagnosis while thunderclap headache happens even related to postural change without obvious neurological deficit in the beginning presentations.},

  abstract = {Growing evidence supports the effectiveness of manual therapy interventions in patients with neck pain; however, considerable attention has also been afforded to the potential risks such as vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI). Despite the existence of guidelines advocating specific screening procedures, research does not support the ability to accurately identify patients at risk. The logical question becomes, "How does one proceed in the absence of certainty?" Given the lack of clear direction for decision making in the peer-reviewed literature, this commentary discusses the uncertainties that exist regarding the ability to identify patients at risk for VBI. The authors hope that this commentary adds additional perspective on manual therapy decision-making strategies in the presence of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Acute as well as chronic pain syndromes are common after whiplash trauma and exercise therapy is proposed as one possible intervention strategy. The aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate the effect of exercise therapy in patients with Whiplash-Associated Disorders for the improvement of neck pain and neck disability, compared with other therapeutic interventions, placebo interventions, no treatment, or waiting list. CONTENT: The review was registered in Prospero (CRD42017060356) and conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A literature search in PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane from inception until January 13, 2020 was combined with a hand search to identify eligible randomized controlled studies. Abstract screening, full text assessment and risk of bias assessment (Cochrane RoB 2.0) were conducted by two independent reviewers. SUMMARY: The search identified 4,103 articles. After removal of duplicates, screening of 2,921 abstracts and full text assessment of 100 articles, 27 articles that reported data for 2,127 patients were included. The included articles evaluated the effect of exercise therapy on neck pain, neck disability or other outcome measures and indicated some positive effects from exercise, but many studies lacked control groups not receiving active treatment. Studies on exercise that could be included in the random-effect meta-analysis showed significant short-term effects on neck pain and medium-term effects on neck disability. OUTLOOK: Despite a large number of articles published in the area of exercise therapy and Whiplash-Associated Disorders, the current evidence base is weak. The results from the present review with meta-analysis suggests that exercise therapy may provide additional effect for improvement of neck pain and disability in patients with Whiplash-Associated Disorders.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the reliability and diagnostic accuracy of typical dermatomes and myotomes for determining the pathologic level in surgically verified patients with cervical radiculopathy. METHODS: Patients who underwent single-level surgery due to cervical radiculopathy with at least a 60\% reduction in preoperative symptoms or recovery of muscle power after surgery were included. The observed clinical symptoms (pain, paresthesia, motor weakness) were compared to those of typical cervical dermatomes and myotomes. RESULTS: Among the 227 patients reviewed, 142 (62.6\%) had a standard dermatomal pattern, and 74 of 110 (67.3\%) had a standard myotomal pattern. The myotome of C5/6 radiculopathy showed much more variance than those of other cervical segments. Among the patients with severe motor weakness (muscle strength {$\leq$} grade 3 or obvious muscle atrophy), all those with involvement of root C5, C7, and C8 showed a typical pattern (C4/5: 13 of 13 patients, C6/7: 5 of 5 patients, C7/T1: 3 of 3 patients), while only 2 of the 6 patients (33.3\%) with severe motor weakness caused by C5/6 radiculopathy fit the typical pattern. CONCLUSION: Among various symptoms, cervical myotome is of great value in determining the pathological level. However, it should be noted that there is high variability in human dermatomes and myotomes, especially for motor weakness due to C6 root compression, which is more variable than others.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: First rib dysfunction is a possible cause of symptoms in patients with neck and/or shoulder pain. OBJECTIVES: To explore therapists' perceptions of useful diagnostic criteria to identify first rib dysfunction. METHODS: A Delphi survey over four rounds involving~international manual therapy experts~who were asked to agree on which items were most useful in identifying first rib dysfunction. RESULTS: Consensus ({$>$}70\% agreement)~was reached on key aspects of first rib dysfunction being first rib mobility restriction, upper limb symptom distribution, and a subclassification into two subgroups was suggested. The main clinical findings suggested were: painful and restricted neck movements and shoulder girdle loading activities; positive~Upper Limb Neural Test 1;~direct palpation of first rib, neural structures, and scalene muscles; pain and hypomobility of first rib accessory movements with improvement after mobilization. The~cervical rotation lateral-flexion test was considered a useful, although not widely used test among~the experts. Its diagnostic accuracy~and interpretation in isolation~was questioned. CONCLUSIONS: This Delphi study produced a cluster of clinical tests aimed to identify first rib dysfunction in patients with neck and/or shoulder conditions. However, these need to be tested out in further research to establish reliability and validity.},
