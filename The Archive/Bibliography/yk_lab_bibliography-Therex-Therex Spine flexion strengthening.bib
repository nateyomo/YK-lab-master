  abstract = {AIM: We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of stabilization exercises versus general exercises or manual therapy in patients with low back pain. DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials, Scielo, and CINAHL (from the earliest date available to November 2014) for randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy of stabilization exercises compared to general exercises or manual therapy on pain, disability, and function in patients with low back pain. Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria (413 stabilization exercises patients, 297 general exercises patients, and 185 manual therapy patients). Stabilization exercises may provide greater benefit than general exercise for pain reduction and improvement in disability. Stabilization exercise improved pain with a WMD of~-1.03 (95\% CI:~-1.29 to~-0.27) and improved disability with a WMD of~-5.41 (95\% CI:~-8.34 to~-2.49). There were no significant differences in pain and disability scores among participants in the stabilization exercise group compared to those in the manual therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Stabilization exercises were as efficacious as manual therapy in decreasing pain and disability and should be encouraged as part of musculoskeletal rehabilitation for low back pain.},

  abstract = {[Purpose] This study aimed to examine the effects of pelvic movements on the back function of patients with lumbar disc herniation when lumbar stabilization exercise was applied to the patients, suggest an intervention method that can be used in future clinical therapies. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty patients with lumbar disc herniation underwent the intervention 30 minutes per day, three times per week for 4 weeks. Of them, 15 patients were assigned to the balance center stabilization resistance exercise group (experimental group I) and the other 15 were assigned to the three-dimensional stabilization exercise group (experimental group II). Before the intervention, disc herniation index was measured using magnetic resonance imaging, sacral angle was measured using X-ray, and back function was measured using the KODI. Four weeks later, these three factors were re-measured and analyzed. [Results] There was a significant pre- versus post-intervention difference in disc herniation index, sacral angle, and KODI in experimental group I and a significant difference in disc herniation index and KODI in experimental group II, and each group of disc herniation index and sacral angle had a significant difference. In experimental group I, each disc herniation index and sacral angle had a negative correlation. [Conclusion] The lumbar stabilization exercise, which controls balance using pelvic movements, improves mobility and stability of the sacroiliac joint; therefore, it increases pelvic and back movements. These kinds of movements not only improved proprioception sense, they also had positive effects on lumbar disc function recovery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inspite of common lifting advice to maintain a lordotic posture, there is debate regarding optimal lumbar spine posture during lifting. To date, the influence of lumbar posture on trunk muscle recruitment, strength and efficiency during high intensity lifting has not been fully explored. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do differences in lumbar posture influence trunk extensor strength (moment), trunk muscle activity, and neuromuscular efficiency during maximal lifting? METHODS: Twenty-six healthy participants adopted three lumbar postures (maximal extension (lordotic), mid-range (flat-back), and fully flexed) in a free lifting position. Motion analysis and force measurements were used to determine the back extensor, hip and knee moments. Surface electromyography (EMG) of three trunk extensors and the internal obliques were recorded. Neuromuscular efficiency (NME) was expressed as a ratio of normalised extensor moment to normalised EMG. RESULTS: Significantly higher back extensor moments were exerted when moving from an extended to mid-range, and from a mid-range to fully flexed lumbar posture. This was accompanied by a decrease in activity across all three back extensor muscles (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) resulting in a higher NME of these muscles in more flexed postures. Change in lumbar posture did not influence hip or knee moments or internal oblique activation. SIGNIFICANCE: A flexed-back posture is associated with increased strength and efficiency of the back muscles compared to a lordotic posture. These findings further question the manual handling advice to lift with a lordotic lumbar spine.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether lumbar spine flexion during lifting is a risk factor for low back pain (LBP) onset/persistence or a differentiator of people with and without LBP. DESIGN: Etiology systematic review with meta-analysis. LITERATURE SEARCH: Database search of ProQuest, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase up to August 21, 2018. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: We included peer-reviewed articles that investigated whether lumbar spine position during lifting was a risk factor for LBP onset or persistence or a differentiator of people with and without LBP. DATA SYNTHESIS: Lifting-task comparison data were tabulated and summarized. The meta-analysis calculated an n-weighted pooled mean {\textpm} SD of the results in the LBP and no-LBP groups. If a study contained multiple comparisons (ie, different lifting tasks that used various weights or directions), then only 1 result from that study was included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Four studies (1 longitudinal study and 3 cross-sectional studies across 5 articles) included in meta-analysis measured lumbar flexion with intralumbar angles and found no difference in peak lumbar spine flexion when lifting (1.5{$^\circ$}; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: -0.7{$^\circ$}, 3.7{$^\circ$}; P = .19 for the longitudinal study and -0.9{$^\circ$}; 95\% CI: -2.5{$^\circ$}, 0.7{$^\circ$}; P = .29 for the cross-sectional studies). Seven cross-sectional studies measured lumbar flexion with thoracopelvic angles and found that people with LBP lifted with 6.0{$^\circ$} less lumbar flexion than people without LBP (95\% CI: -11.2{$^\circ$}, -0.9{$^\circ$}; P = .02). Most (9/11) studies reported no significant between-group differences in lumbar flexion during lifting. The included studies were of low quality. CONCLUSION: There was low-quality evidence that greater lumbar spine flexion during lifting was not a risk factor for LBP onset/persistence or a differentiator of people with and without LBP.
