  abstract = {The physical examination of the thrower's elbow presents the clinician with the clinical challenge of differentially diagnosing specific pathologies. The examination should include a thorough history and a well-organized physical examination, which relies on an extensive knowledge of the functional anatomy of the elbow. The components of an elbow examination include inspection/observation, palpation of bony and soft tissues, range of motion assessment, resisted muscle testing (both manual and mechanical), neurologic testing, and special tests. The special tests commonly performed on the thrower's elbow are the Tinel test, tennis elbow sign, ulnar collateral ligament stability testing, valgus extension overload test, and radiocapitella chondromalacia test. Other tests include radiographic examination, such as computerized tomograph arthrogram and magnetic resonance imaging testing. Information presented in this paper will provide the clinician with a systematic and thorough evaluation process for the thrower's elbow.},

  abstract = {The repetitive nature of throwing manifests characteristic adaptive changes to the shoulder, scapulothoracic, and hip/pelvis complexes that result in a set of unique physical traits in the overhead throwing athlete. An effective rehabilitation program is dependent upon an accurate evaluation and differential diagnosis to determine the causative factors for the athlete's pathologic features. The treatment program should be individualized with specific strengthening and flexibility exercises to achieve the dynamic stability that is required for overhead function. In this article we describe the characteristics of the throwing shoulder, along with a multiphased rehabilitation program that allows for the restoration of strength, mobility, endurance, and power and is aimed toward a return to unrestricted sporting activity. We also describe exercises that link the upper and lower extremities because of the importance of core control and leg strength in the development of power during the act of throwing. Additionally, proper throwing mechanics, utilization of pitch counts, appropriate rest, and proper off-season conditioning will help decrease overall injury risk in the overhead throwing athlete.},

  abstract = {The overhead throwing motion is an extremely stressful athletic movement. The high velocity and repetitive nature of this activity places immense pressure on the entire body, which can frequently result in injury to the throwing arm. Extensive literature exists with regards to the management of these injuries in the collegiate and professional level athlete; and it is well understood that a multiphasic approach is required to return an individual to prior level of play. However, there is a gap in the literature which fails to address the management of youth individuals. This article presents a new and innovative approach to the rehabilitation, training and management of the youth overhead throwing athlete, The Youth Throwers Ten Exercise Program. This program addresses principles of: coactivation, coordination, dynamic stabilization, neuromuscular control, proprioception, muscle strength, endurance and scapular rhythm all of which are vital for successful performance. This exercise series utilizes bodyweight and Theraband exercises that cater to the unique characteristics of the youth athlete making it a safe way to prepare for the demands of overhead throwing activities.},
