  abstract = {Statistical procedures underpin the process of scientific discovery. As researchers, one way we use these procedures is to test the validity of a null hypothesis. Often, we test the validity of more than one null hypothesis. If we fail to use an appropriate procedure to account for this multiplicity, then we are more likely to reach a wrong scientific conclusion-we are more likely to make a mistake. In physiology, experiments that involve multiple comparisons are common: of the original articles published in 1997 by the American Physiological Society, approximately 40\% cite a multiple comparison procedure. In this review, I demonstrate the statistical issue embedded in multiple comparisons, and I summarize the philosophies of handling this issue. I also illustrate the three procedures-Newman-Keuls, Bonferroni, least significant difference-cited most often in my literature review; each of these procedures is of limited practical value. Last, I demonstrate the false discovery rate procedure, a promising development in multiple comparisons. The false discovery rate procedure may be the best practical solution to the problems of multiple comparisons that exist within physiology and other scientific disciplines.},

  abstract = {The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is a popular nonparametric test for comparing two independent populations (groups). In recent years, there have been renewed attempts in extending the Wilcoxon rank sum test for clustered data, one of which (Datta and Satten, 2005, Journal of the American Statistical Association 100, 908-915) addresses the issue of informative cluster size, i.e., when the outcomes and the cluster size are correlated. We are faced with a situation where the group specific marginal distribution in a cluster depends on the number of observations in that group (i.e., the intra-cluster group size). We develop a novel extension of the rank-sum test for handling this situation. We compare the performance of our test with the Datta-Satten test, as well as the naive Wilcoxon rank sum test. Using a naturally occurring simulation model of informative intra-cluster group size, we show that only our test maintains the correct size. We also compare our test with a classical signed rank test based on averages of the outcome values in each group paired by the cluster membership. While this test maintains the size, it has lower power than our test. Extensions to multiple group comparisons and the case of clusters not having samples from all groups are also discussed. We apply our test to determine whether there are differences in the attachment loss between the upper and lower teeth and between mesial and buccal sites of periodontal patients.},

  abstract = {The Newman-Keuls (NK) procedure for testing all pairwise comparisons among a set of treatment means, introduced by Newman (1939) and in a slightly different form by Keuls (1952) was proposed as a reasonable way to alleviate the inflation of error rates when a large number of means are compared. It was proposed before the concepts of different types of multiple error rates were introduced by Tukey (1952a, b; 1953). Although it was popular in the 1950s and 1960s, once control of the familywise error rate (FWER) was accepted generally as an appropriate criterion in multiple testing, and it was realized that the NK procedure does not control the FWER at the nominal level at which it is performed, the procedure gradually fell out of favor. Recently, a more liberal criterion, control of the false discovery rate (FDR), has been proposed as more appropriate in some situations than FWER control. This paper notes that the NK procedure and a nonparametric extension controls the FWER within any set of homogeneous treatments. It proves that the extended procedure controls the FDR when there are well-separated clusters of homogeneous means and between-cluster test statistics are independent, and extensive simulation provides strong evidence that the original procedure controls the FDR under the same conditions and some dependent conditions when the clusters are not well-separated. Thus, the test has two desirable error-controlling properties, providing a compromise between FDR control with no subgroup FWER control and global FWER control. Yekutieli (2002) developed an FDR-controlling procedure for testing all pairwise differences among means, without any FWER-controlling criteria when there is more than one cluster. The empirica example in Yekutieli's paper was used to compare the Benjamini-Hochberg (1995) method with apparent FDR control in this context, Yekutieli's proposed method with proven FDR control, the Newman-Keuls method that controls FWER within equal clusters with apparent FDR control, and several methods that control FWER globally. The Newman-Keuls is shown to be intermediate in number of rejections to the FWER-controlling methods and the FDR-controlling methods in this example, although it is not always more conservative than the other FDR-controlling methods.},
