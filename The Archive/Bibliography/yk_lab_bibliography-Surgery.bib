  abstract = {Total joint arthroplasty has traditionally been performed as an inpatient procedure to mitigate the risks of perioperative complications, limited mobility, and pain control issues. Reducing readmissions and complications is increasingly important with the push toward outcomes based reimbursement. Nonetheless, there is a definite trend toward not only shortening postoperative length of stay but also toward considering a same day discharge arthroplasty model in appropriately selected patients. In this review, we outline the literature evidence regarding same day discharge in total joint arthroplasty and discuss our own institutional guidelines for appropriate patient selection as well as contraindications.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With the removal of both total knee and total hip arthroplasty from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' inpatient-only list, efforts to improve efficiency of the perioperative management of total joint patients have increased recently. The publication of several recent studies examining the impact of anesthesia type on outcomes has prompted the need to review the overall state of evidence for spinal versus general anesthesia for outpatient total joint arthroplasty. RECENT FINDINGS: Overall complication rates are low in this carefully selected patient population. The majority of patients who are preselected for outpatient total joint arthroplasty appear to successfully achieve this outcome. Some retrospective studies have suggested a benefit for spinal anesthesia in terms of same-day discharge success but direct comparisons in prospective studies are lacking. SUMMARY: The type of anesthesia used for total joint arthroplasty may have an important effect on outcomes. Until randomized control trials are performed we must rely on existing evidence, which suggests that both spinal and general anesthesia can lead to successful outcomes after ambulatory total joint arthroplasty.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-stay joint replacement programmes are used in many countries but there has been little scrutiny of safety outcomes in the literature. We aimed to systematically review evidence on the safety of short-stay programmes versus usual care for total hip (THR) and knee replacement (KR), and optimal patient selection. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies including a comparator group reporting on 14 safety outcomes (hospital readmissions, reoperations, blood loss, emergency department visits, infection, mortality, neurovascular injury, other complications, periprosthetic fractures, postoperative falls, venous thromboembolism, wound complications, dislocation, stiffness) within 90~days postoperatively in adults\,{$\geq$}\,18~years undergoing primary THR or KR were included. Secondary outcomes were associations between patient demographics or clinical characteristics and patient outcomes. Four databases were searched between January 2000 and May 2023. Risk of bias and certainty of the evidence were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies were included. Based upon low certainty RCT evidence, short-stay programmes may not reduce readmission (OR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.12-7.43); blood transfusion requirements (OR 1.75, 95\% CI 0.27-11.36); neurovascular injury (OR 0.31, 95\% CI 0.01-7.92); other complications (OR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.26-1.53); or stiffness (OR 1.04, 95\% CI 0.53-2.05). For registry studies, there was no difference in readmission, infection, neurovascular injury, other complications, venous thromboembolism, or wound complications but there were reductions in mortality and dislocations. For interrupted time series studies, there was no difference in readmissions, reoperations, blood loss volume, emergency department visits, infection, mortality, or neurovascular injury; reduced odds of blood transfusion and other complications, but increased odds of periprosthetic fracture. For other observational studies, there was an increased risk of readmission, no difference in blood loss volume, infection, other complications, or wound complications, reduced odds of requiring blood transfusion, reduced mortality, and reduced venous thromboembolism. One study examined an outcome relevant to optimal patient selection; it reported comparable blood loss for short-stay male and female participants (p\,=\,0.814). CONCLUSIONS: There is low certainty evidence that short-stay programmes for THR and KR may have non-inferior 90-day safety outcomes. There is little evidence on factors informing optimal patient selection; this remains an important knowledge gap.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spinal anesthesia is the predominant regimen in outpatient total joint arthroplasty (TJA), but induction often is unsuccessful, unobtainable, or against patient preference. We compared outcomes of same-day discharge (SDD) TJA with spinal versus general anesthesia in a free-standing ambulatory surgery center (ASC). METHODS: We took 105 general anesthesia TJA and one-to-one nearest-neighbor matched them to 105 spinal anesthesia TJA over 7 years at 1 ASC. The rate of successful SDD, minutes to discharge, postoperative pain and nausea, and 90-day complications were compared. Postanesthesia care unit outcomes were additionally stratified by spinal anesthetic (mepivacaine versus bupivacaine). RESULTS: All spinal anesthetic patients underwent SDD compared with 103 (98\%) general anesthetic patients (P~= .498). Mepivacaine spinal anesthesia patients spent the fewest minutes in postanesthesia care unit prior to discharge from the facility (206), followed by general anesthesia (227), and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia (291; P {$<$} .001). General anesthesia patients had the highest levels of pain at 1~hour (5.2 versus 1.5 versus 1.5) and 2~hours (3.2 versus 2.0 versus 1.3) postoperatively, and rates of nausea (48 versus 22 versus 28\%) compared with mepivacaine and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia, respectively. The 90-day complications (6 versus 7), admissions (1 versus 3), and reoperations (5 versus 2) were similar among spinal and general anesthesia, respectively (P {$\geq$} .445). CONCLUSIONS: Both spinal and general anesthesia led to reliable SDD with similar 90-day complication rates. General anesthesia facilitated faster discharge from the ASC compared with bupivacaine spinal anesthesia but led to higher levels of pain and incidence of nausea postoperatively.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orthostatic intolerance (OI)-type events following hip and knee arthroplasty increase the risk of falls, hospital length of stay, and health-care costs. There is a limited understanding of the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events in patients during the acute hospital stay. Our aim was to systematically review the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events during the acute hospital stay following hip and knee arthroplasty. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that investigated the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events was undertaken. A comprehensive search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL from their inception to October 2021. The methodological quality of identified studies was assessed using the modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (14,055 patients) were included. The incidence was 2\% to 52\% for an OI event, 1\% to 46\% for orthostatic hypotension, and 0\% to 18\% for syncope/vasovagal events. Two studies reported female sex, high peak pain levels ({$>$}5 out of 10) during mobilization, postoperative use of gabapentin, and the absence of postoperative intravenous dexamethasone as risk factors. There was no consensus on the definition and assessment of an OI-type event. CONCLUSIONS: OI-type events are common during the acute hospital stay following hip and knee arthroplasty, and 4 risk factors have been reported for OI-type events. High-quality prospective cohort studies are required to systematically and reliably determine the incidence of and risk factors for OI-type events. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level IV.

  abstract = {BACKGOUND: Balance and proprioceptive deficits are frequently persistent after total joint replacement, limiting functionality and involving altered movement patterns and difficulties in walking and maintaining postural control among patients. RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate the short- and mid-term effects of proprioceptive and balance training for patients undergoing total knee and hip replacement. METHODS: This is a systematic review of literature. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PEDro, and Scopus were the databases searched. The review included randomized clinical trials in which the experimental groups underwent a training aimed at improving balance and proprioception, in addition to conventional care. The studies had to assess at least one of the following outcomes: self-reported functionality or balance (primary outcomes), knee function, pain, falls, or quality of life. RESULTS: Eight trials were included, involving 567 participants. The quantitative synthesis found a moderate to high significant effect of balance and proprioceptive trainings on self-reported functionality and balance after total knee replacement. The effects were maintained at mid-term in terms of balance alone. Conversely, preoperative training did not enhance outcomes after total hip arthroplasty. SIGNIFICANCE: The synthesis showed that, in clinical terms, balance trainings are a convenient complement to conventional physiotherapy care to produce an impact on balance and functionality after knee replacement. If outcomes such as improvement in pain, knee range of movement, or patient quality of life are to be promoted, it would be advisable to explore alternative proposals specifically targeting these goals. Further research is needed to confirm or discard the current evidence ultimately, predominantly in terms of the effects on the hips and those yielded by preoperative interventions.},

This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with persistent pain after total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) surgeries. To meet the inclusion criteria, studies were required to assess variables before or at the time of surgery, include a persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) outcome measure at least 2 months after a TKR or THR surgery, and include a statistical analysis of the effect of the risk factor(s) on the outcome measure. Outcomes from studies implementing univariate and multivariable statistical models were analyzed separately. Where possible, data from univariate analyses on the same factors were combined in a meta-analysis. Eighty-one studies involving 171,354 patients were included in the review. Because of the heterogeneity of assessment methods, only 44\% of the studies allowed meaningful meta-analysis. In meta-analyses, state anxiety (but not trait anxiety) scores and higher depression scores on the Beck Depression Inventory were associated with an increased risk of PPSP after TKR. In the qualitative summary of multivariable analyses, higher preoperative pain scores were associated with PPSP after TKR or THR. This review systematically assessed factors associated with an increased risk of PPSP after TKR and THR and highlights current knowledge gaps that can be addressed by future research.},

The aim of our quality improvement project is to reduce the acute hospitalization length of stay to less than 2 days and decrease the percentage of TKA patients discharged to inpatient rehabilitation using an enhanced recovery after surgery bundle. METHODS: This study used a before-and-after design. The pre-intervention period was January to December 2017 and the post-intervention period was January 2018 to August 2019. A root cause analysis was performed by a multidisciplinary team to identify barriers for rapid recovery and discharge. Four new interventions were chosen as part of an improvement bundle based on existing local practices, literature review, and feasibility analysis: (1) perioperative peripheral nerve block; (2) prophylactic antiemetic medication; (3) avoidance of routine preoperative urinary catheterization; and (4) preoperative patient education. RESULTS: The pre-intervention and post-intervention groups included 232 and 383 patients, respectively. Mean length of stay decreased from 2.82 to 2.13 days (P {$<$} .001). The need for inpatient rehabilitation decreased from 20.2\% to 10.7\% (P~= .002). Mean 24-hour oral morphine consumption decreased from 60 to 38 mg (P {$<$} .001). The percentage of patients experiencing moderate-to-severe pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting within the first 24 hours decreased by 25\% and 15\%, respectively (P {$<$} .001). Thirty-day emergency department visits following discharge decreased from 12.9\% to 7.3\% (P~= .030). CONCLUSION: Significant improvements in the recovery of patients after TKA were achieved by performing a root cause analysis and implementing a multidisciplinary, patient-centered enhanced recovery after surgery bundle.

Risk factors are emerging to better stratify patients at high risk for CPOP. Perioperative analgesia plays an important role in managing acute postoperative pain and in some cases may limit its transition to CPOP. Acute postoperative pain is adaptive, normal, expected, and has a well-defined trajectory, while CPOP is maladaptive and, as a form of chronic pain, is challenging to treat. Good analgesia, early ambulation, and rehabilitation efforts may be helpful in preventing CPOP following certain surgeries.

The objectives of this study were (1) to identify our institution's most common causes for failed SDD, and (2) to evaluate risk factors associated with failed SDD. METHODS: A retrospective review of SDD patients undergoing primary TKA or THA from January 2021 to September 2022 was conducted. Reasons for SDD failure were recorded and differences between successful and failed SDD cases were assessed via a multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 85.3\% (651 of 753) of patients included were successful SDDs. Failed SDD occurred in 16.8\% (74 of 441) of TKA and 11.8\% (38 of 322) of THA cases. Primary reasons included failure to clear physical therapy (33.0\%, 37 of 112), postoperative hypotension (20.5\%, 23 of 112), and urinary retention (16.9\%, 19 of 112). Analysis revealed that overall failed SDD cases were more likely to have had prior opioid use and a longer surgical time. Failed TKA SDD cases were more likely to have had a longer surgical time and not have receive a preoperative nerve block, while failed THA SDD cases were more likely to be older. CONCLUSIONS: The SDD selection criteria and pathways continue to evolve, with multiple factors contributing to failed SDD. Improving patient selection algorithms and optimizing post-operative pathways can enhance the ability to successfully choose SDD candidates. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.},

This study evaluated the cardiovascular response and tissue oxygenation to mobilization before and after surgery in relation to OI in fast-track THA patients. METHODS: OI and the cardiovascular response to standing were evaluated with a standardized mobilization protocol, before, 6, and 24 h after surgery in 26 patients undergoing THA with spinal anaesthesia and an opioid-sparing analgesic regime. Haemoglobin, fluid balance, and opioid use were recorded. Systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance were measured non-invasively (Nexfin({\textregistered})) and cerebral ( ) and muscle tissue oxygenation by non-infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: No patients demonstrated OI before surgery, whereas 11 (42\%) and five (19\%) patients experienced OI 6 and 24 h after surgery, respectively. OI was associated with decreased orthostatic responses in SAP, DAP, SV, CO, and compared with orthostatic tolerant patients (P{$<$}0.05). There was no difference in postoperative haemoglobin concentrations or opioid use between orthostatic intolerant and tolerant patients. CONCLUSIONS: Early postoperative OI is common in patients undergoing THA and is associated with an impaired cardiovascular orthostatic response and decreased cerebral oxygenation.},

Experts in rehabilitation content and complex interventions independently coded rehabilitation interventions. The team assessed strength of evidence. Large heterogeneity across evaluated rehabilitation programs limited conclusions. Evidence from 15 studies suggests that diverse rehabilitation programs may not differ in terms of risk of harm or outcomes of pain, strength, activities of daily living, or quality of life (all low strength of evidence). Evidence is insufficient for other outcomes. In conclusion, no differences in outcomes were found between different rehabilitation programs after THA. Further evidence is needed to inform decisions on what attributes of rehabilitation programs are most effective for various outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative orthostatic intolerance can limit mobilization after hip and knee arthroplasty. The literature is lacking on the incidence and risk factors associated with orthostatic intolerance after elective arthroplasty. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study of primary total hip, total knee, and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty patients was conducted. Patients with orthostatic events were identified, and potential demographic and perioperative risk factors were recorded. Orthostatic intolerance was defined as postoperative syncope, lightheadedness, or dizziness, limiting ambulation and/or requiring medical treatment. Statistical analysis was completed using Pearson's chi-square test for categorical data and t-tests for continuous data. Binary logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: A total of 500 consecutive patients were included. The overall incidence of orthostatic intolerance was 18\%; 25\% in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 11\% in total knee arthroplasty. On univariate analysis, significant risk factors for developing postoperative orthostatic intolerance include older age, female gender, THA surgery, lower American Society of Anesthesiologists class, absence of recreational drug use, lower estimated blood volume, lower preoperative diastolic blood pressure, spinal with monitored anesthesia care (MAC), posterior approach for THA, bupivacaine use in spinal, percent of blood loss, postoperative oxycodone or tramadol use, higher postoperative intravenous fluid volume, and lower postoperative hemoglobin. Multivariate analysis demonstrated persistent significance of female gender, THA surgery, spinal with MAC, bupivacaine use in spinal, and more intravenous fluid administered postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Orthostatic intolerance affects a significant number of arthroplasty patients. Awareness of risk factors and modification of perioperative variables linked to orthostatic intolerance may assist the surgeon in choosing the appropriate surgical setting, educating patients, and improving early postoperative recovery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis and subsequent total hip arthroplasty (THA) lead to damages to hip joint mechanoceptors, which in turns lead to impairments in proprioception. One of the abilities mainly affected by an altered joint proprioception is balance. The aim of this work was to investigate the balance and proprioception impairments, current assessment tools, and rehabilitation training after THA. METHODS: A systematic literature revision was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Articles reporting balance and proprioception impairments, current assessment tools, or rehabilitation interventions were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. A total of 41 articles were included, 33 discussing balance and proprioception assessment, and 8 dealing with training. Data related to type of surgical approach, type and timing of assessment protocols, assessment instrumentation, and type, volume and duration of the rehabilitation training were extracted from each study. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were of high quality, 2 of moderate quality and 8 of low-quality. Literature review showed an improvement in balance following THA in comparison with the pre-operative performance, although balance abnormalities persist up to 5\,years after surgery, with THA patients showing an increased risk for falls. Balance training is effective in all the rehabilitation phases if specifically structured for balance enhancement and consistent in training volume. It remains unclear which assessments are more appropriate for the different rehabilitation phases, and if differences exist between the different surgical procedures used for THA. Only two studies assessed proprioception. CONCLUSION: Balance and proprioception show impairments up to 5\,years after THA, increasing the risk of falls. However, patients with THA may benefit of an adequate balance training. Further research is needed to investigate the gaps in balance and proprioception assessment and training following THA surgery.},

METHODS               Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the authors conducted an exhaustive review of multiple electronic databases. Potential articles were screened using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two authors independently analyzed these studies using predefined data fields, including study quality indicators such as level of evidence and availability of accepted patient-reported outcomes measures. These findings were synthesized in a narrative format. A third author resolved disagreements regarding the inclusion of a study.                                         RESULTS               Twenty-one articles with I or II levels of evidence were included in the review. The authors divided the findings of the literature review into several groups: rehabilitation terminology, timing and duration of postfusion rehabilitation, the need for rehabilitation relative to surgery-related morbidity, rehabilitation's relationship to outcomes, and cognitive and psychosocial aspects of postsurgical rehabilitation. Current evidence generally supports formal rehabilitation after lumbar fusion surgery. Starting physical therapy at the 12-week postoperative mark results in better outcomes at lower cost than an earlier, 6-week start. Where available, psychosocial support improves outcomes. However, a number of the questions could not be answered with high-grade evidence. In these cases, the authors used ``best evidence available'' to make recommendations. There are many cases in which different types of caregivers use clinical terminology differently. The data supporting an optimal protocol for postfusion rehabilitation remains elusive but, using the data available, the authors have crafted recommendations and a model protocol, which is currently undergoing prospective study.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Rehabilitation has long been a common feature in the postoperative management of patients undergoing spinal fusion. Although caregivers from multiple disciplines agree that the majority of their patients will benefit from this effort, the supporting data remain sparse. In creating a model protocol for postlumbar fusion rehabilitation, the authors hope to share a starting point for future postoperative lumbar fusion rehabilitation research.},

We aimed to study postoperative changes in vascular tone and their potential association with OI in various orthopedic surgical settings. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 350 patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty under neuraxial anesthesia or spine surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. We determined the augmentation index (AI) as a measure of vascular tone and studied symptoms of OI using a validated questionnaire at various postoperative time points. RESULTS: The AI was significantly reduced postoperatively (at spinal resolution in patients with neuraxial anesthesia or two hours postoperatively in general anesthesia) compared with baseline values in all procedures and did not subsequently return to baseline throughout the postoperative period in the majority of patients [252/335 (75.2\%); P {$<$} 0.001]. The majority [260/342 (76.0\%); P {$<$} 0.001] of patients had postoperative symptoms of OI. Nevertheless, no association was found between postoperative change in AI from baseline and postoperative symptoms of OI. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly prolonged decrease in AI and symptoms of OI are common after orthopedic surgery. Nevertheless, an association between the two measures was not observed. While compensatory mechanisms may limit the influence of an AI decrease on symptoms of OI, more research is needed to understand the contributing factors and aid in the identification of patients at risk of OI.},

RESULTS: Overall, there were 47 cases (0.44\%) of foot drop, but over time the incidence dropped from 0.6\% to 0.3\% (p = 0.033). Preoperative protrusio acetabulae (p {$<$} 0.001), female sex (p {$<$} 0.001) and junior grade of surgeon (p {$<$} 0.009) were all significant risk factors.

The purpose of this study was to identify both preoperative and postoperative reasons for readmission within 30 days following primary total hip and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: Retrospective data were collected for patients who underwent elective primary total hip arthroplasty (THA; CPT code 27130) and TKA (27447) from 2008 to 2013 at our institution. The sample was separated into readmitted and nonreadmitted cohorts. Demography, comorbidities, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), operative parameters, readmission rates, and causes of readmission were compared between the groups using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: There were 42 (3.4\%) and 28 (2.2\%) readmissions within 30 days for THA and TKA, respectively. The most common cause of readmission within 30 days following total joint arthroplasty was infection. Trauma was the second most common reason for readmission of a THA while wound dehiscence was the second most common cause for readmission following TKA. With univariate regression, there were multiple associated factors for readmission among THA and TKA patients, including body mass index, metabolic equivalent (MET), and CCI. Multivariate regression revealed that hospital length of stay was significantly associated with 30-day readmission after THA and TKA. CONCLUSION: Patient comorbidities and preoperative functional capacity significantly affect 30-day readmission rate following total joint arthroplasty. Adjustments for these parameters should be considered and we recommend the use of CCI and METs in risk adjustment models that use 30-day readmission as a marker for quality of patient care.

The purpose of the study is to identify the causes for failed same-day discharge (SDD) and perioperative factors leading to failed SDD. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study followed pre-selected patients for SDD THA from 1 August 2018 to 31 December 2020. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing unilateral THA with appropriate social support, age 18 to 75 years, and BMI {$<$} 37 kg/m2. Patients with opioid dependence, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease were excluded. Demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative data were collected from the electronic medical records. Possible risk factors for failed SDD were identified using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In all, 278 patients were identified with a mean age of 57.1 years (SD 8.1) and a mean BMI of 27.3 kg/m2 (SD 4.5). A total of 96 patients failed SDD, with the most common reasons being failure to clear physical therapy (26\%), dizziness (22\%), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (11\%). Risk factors associated with failed SDD included smokers (odds ratio (OR) 6.24; p = 0.009), a maximum postoperative pain score {$>$} 8 (OR 4.76; p = 0.004), and procedures starting after 11 am (OR 2.28; p = 0.015). A higher postoperative tolerable pain goal (numerical rating scale 4 to 10) was found to be associated with successful SDD (OR 2.7; p = 0.001). Age, BMI, surgical approach, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, and anaesthesia type were not associated with failed SDD. CONCLUSION: SDD is a safe and viable option for pre-selected patients interested in rapid recovery THA. The most common causes for failure to launch were failing to clear physical thereapy and patient symptomatology. Risk factors associated with failed SSD highlight the importance of preoperative counselling regarding smoking cessation and postoperative pain to set reasonable expectations. Future interventions should aim to improve patient postoperative mobilization, pain control, and decrease symptomatology.Cite this article: Bone Jt Open~2022;3(9):684-691.},

In this study, 19 patients with a documented neurologic complication were identified after a retrospective review of 1,476 primary TKAs performed between January 1970 and December 1998 at the New York Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia University, for an overall incidence of 1.3\%. Contrary to previously published data, valgus deformity, flexion contracture, the use of postoperative epidural anesthesia, the prolonged use of pneumatic tourniquets, and preexisting neuropathy were not associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy after TKA based on our data. A larger percentage of rheumatoid knees experienced a neurologic injury than was expected, however. No other significant risk factors for peripheral neuropathy after TKA were identified based on data from our patients. Immediately after discovery of the nerve palsy, conservative treatment was employed for each of our patients. All patients showed at least a partial recovery at the end of follow-up, with most experiencing a complete recovery from symptoms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early postoperative mobilisation is important for enhanced recovery, but can be hindered by orthostatic intolerance, characterised by dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling of heat, blurred vision and ultimately syncope. Although the incidence of orthostatic intolerance following total hip arthroplasty has been identified, few studies have yet investigated potential risk factors for developing orthostatic intolerance after hip arthroplasty. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of orthostatic intolerance on the first postoperative day after total hip arthroplasty, potential predisposing risk factors for developing orthostatic intolerance and its effect on length of stay. DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary hospital, Auckland, New Zealand, May to September 2015. PATIENTS: One hundred and seventeen consecutive patients undergoing unilateral total hip arthroplasty. Patients were excluded if they had revision surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of orthostatic intolerance during mobilisation on the first postoperative day. Significant peri-operative risk factors for developing orthostatic intolerance were identified using logistic regression. Length of stay was compared between orthostatic intolerant and orthostatic tolerant patients using the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: On the first postoperative day, 22\% of patients failed mobilisation due to orthostatic intolerance. Factors independently associated with orthostatic intolerance were female sex; OR (95\% CI), 3.11 (1.01 to 9.57), postoperative use of gabapentin; OR 3.55 (1.24 to 10.15) and high peak pain levels ({$\geq$}5/10) during mobilisation; OR 4.05 (1.30 to 12.61). Overall, 78\% of patients were correctly identified. The model was more accurate at predicting those who would not get orthostatic intolerance (89\% correct), compared with those who did have orthostatic intolerance (39\% correct). Length of stay was longer in patients with orthostatic intolerance (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.019). CONCLUSION: Orthostatic intolerance is common after total hip arthroplasty. Optimising pain control prior to mobilisation and limiting gabapentin use may modify the risk of developing postoperative orthostatic intolerance. Although personalised recovery pathways appear attractive, at present, the ability to predict at-risk individuals is still limited.},

OA affects millions of Americans, and with an incidence of 88 symptomatic cases per 100,000 patients per year,~translating to hip OA claiming the top underlying diagnosis leading to THA. Other underlying diagnoses include hip osteonecrosis (ON), congenital hip disorders, and inflammatory arthritis. The underlying diagnosis that leads to a degenerative hip is an important consideration as this has been shown to impact overall outcome. Overall, THA provides consistent short-term and long-term pain relief and positive patient-reported clinical and functional outcomes. In general, THA provides even more reliable and consistent positive results compared to its counterpart procedure, the total knee arthroplasty (TKA).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sciatic nerve injury following total hip arthroplasty (THA) predominantly affects the peroneal division of the sciatic nerve, often causing a foot drop. This can result from a focal etiology (hardware malposition, prominent screw, or postoperative hematoma) or nonfocal/traction injury. The objective of this study was to compare the clinicoradiological features and define the extent of nerve injury resulting from these two distinct mechanisms. METHODS: Patients who developed a postoperative foot drop within 1 year after primary or revision THA with a confirmed proximal sciatic neuropathy based on MRI or electrodiagnostic studies were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two cohorts: group 1 (focal injury), including patients with an identifiable focal structural etiology, and group 2 (nonfocal injury), including patients with a presumed traction injury. Patient demographics, clinical examinations, subsequent surgeries, electrodiagnostic study results, and MRI abnormalities were noted. The Student t-test was used to compare time to onset of foot drop and time to secondary surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, treated by one surgeon, met inclusion criteria (8 men and 13 women; 14 primary THAs and 7 revision THAs). Group 1 had a significantly longer time from THA to the onset of foot drop, with a mean of 2 months, compared with an immediate postoperative onset in group 2 (p = 0.02). Group 1 had a consistent pattern of localized focal nerve abnormality on imaging. In contrast, the majority of patients in group 2 (n = 11) had a long, continuous segment of abnormal size and signal intensity of the nerve, while the other 3 patients had a segment of less abnormal nerve in the midthigh on imaging. All patients with a long continuous lesion had Medical Research Council grade 0 dorsiflexion prior to secondary nerve surgeries compared with 1 of 3 patients with a more normal midsegment. CONCLUSIONS: There are distinct clinicoradiological findings in patients with sciatic injuries resulting from a focal structural etiology versus a traction injury. While there are discrete localized changes in patients with a focal etiology, those with traction injuries demonstrate a diffuse zone of abnormality within the sciatic nerve. A proposed mechanism involves anatomical tether points of the nerve acting as points of origin and propagation for traction injuries, resulting in an immediate postoperative foot drop. In contrast, patients with a focal etiology have localized imaging findings but a highly variable time to the onset of foot drop.},

METHODS: Between May 2001 and May 2013, a total of 495 patients undergoing routine TKA were analyzed retrospectively. Independent risk factors related to postoperative acute hypotension after TKA were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of the 495 patients undergoing TKA, 61 (12.32\%) developed postoperative acute hypotension after surgery. Univariate analysis showed that preoperative Neu, time of surgery, time of anesthesia, pressure of tourniquet, time of using tourniquet, preoperative hypertension, age and type of surgery were significant influencing factors, whereas by multivariate analysis, only age, pressure of tourniquet and type of surgery were significant influencing factors. CONCLUSION: Factors those were associated with a significantly increased postoperative acute hypotension after TKA included age, pressure of tourniquet and type of surgery. Achieving a good preoperative and postoperative evaluation and monitoring vital signs and disease change contribute to the detection, intervention and salvage for the acute hypotension.},

However, the incidence of preoperative anemia in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and its relationship to postoperative outcomes has not been previously reported. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search through PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Sincien, and Embase from inception to July 2023 to investigate the prevalence of preoperative anemia in patients undergoing Total Joint Arthroplasty, comorbidities between anemic and non-anemicpatients before surgery, and postoperative outcomes. postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Overall prevalence was calculated using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity between studies was examined by Cochran's Q test and quantified by the I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and validated by Egger's test. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies with 369,101 samples were included, all of which were retrospective cohort studies. 3 studies were of high quality and 18 studies were of moderate quality. The results showed that the prevalence of preoperative anemia was 22\% in patients awaiting arthroplasty; subgroup analyses revealed that the prevalence of preoperative anemia was highest in patients awaiting revision of total knee arthroplasty; the highest prevalence of preoperative anemia was found in the Americas; preoperative anemia was more prevalent in the female than in the male population; and preoperative anemia with a history of preoperative anemia was more common in the female than in the male population. patients with a history of preoperative anemia; patients with joint replacement who had a history of preoperative anemia had an increased risk of infection, postoperative blood transfusion rate, postoperative blood transfusion, Deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs, days in hospital, readmission within three months, and mortality compared with patients who did not have preoperative anemia. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of preoperative anemia in patients awaiting total joint arthroplasty is 22\%, and is higher in TKA and female patients undergoing revision, while preoperative anemia is detrimental to the patient's postoperative recovery and will increase the risk of postoperative complications, transfusion rates, days in the hospital, readmission rates, and mortality.},
