  abstract = {AIM: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) admitted to a specialized rehabilitation unit in a regional hospital. A secondary aim was to identify patient characteristics and functioning that predicted changes in the PSFS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cohort study, 59 patients with ABI were assessed for the ability to complete the PSFS. A trained multidisciplinary team applied the PSFS as part of a collaborative development of rehabilitation goals. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS), the Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC), the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT), the Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment (NBAA) and the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) were used to identify characteristics of the sample. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between changes in the PSFS score from admission to discharge and a selected set of participant baseline characteristics and functioning. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (92\%) of the patients with ABI were able to complete the PSFS. The five (8\%) who were unable to complete the PSFS had severe cognitive or language impairment. The PSFS score improved by a mean of 2.6 (SD 2.0) points from admission to discharge. The LOTCA score made the strongest unique contribution to explain the change in the PSFS score (beta = 0.477, p= 0.020). CONCLUSION: In the present study, most patients with ABI (92\%) were able to complete the PSFS. Cognitive function on admission was a predictor of improved functioning on the PSFS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the validity, reliability, responsiveness, and interpretability of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) in subacute stroke rehabilitation to determine its suitability to measure patient-identified rehabilitation goals. METHODS: A prospective observational study was designed according to the checklist from Consensus-Based Standards for Selecting Health Measurement Instruments. Seventy-one patients diagnosed with stroke were recruited in the subacute phase from a rehabilitation unit in Norway. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health was used to assess the content validity. Assessment of construct validity was based on hypotheses for correlation of the PSFS and comparator measurements. We assessed reliability by calculating the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) (3.1) and the standard error of measurement. The assessment of responsiveness was based on hypotheses for the correlation of change scores between the PSFS and the comparator measurements. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to assess responsiveness. The smallest detectable change and minimal important change were calculated. RESULTS: Eighty percent of the PSFS items were classified as activities and participation in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, indicating satisfactory content validity. The reliability was satisfactory with an ICC of 0.81 (95\% CI\,=\,0.69-0.89). The standard error of measurement was 0.70 point, and the smallest detectable change was 1.94 points. Five of 7 hypotheses were confirmed for construct validity, and 5 of 6 were confirmed for responsiveness, indicating moderate construct validity and high responsiveness. Assessing responsiveness with a criterion approach resulted in an area under the curve of 0.74. A ceiling effect was identified for 25\% of the participants 3~months after discharge. The minimal important change was estimated to be 1.58 points. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates satisfactory measurement properties for the PSFS in individuals undergoing inpatient stroke rehabilitation. IMPACT: This study supports the use of the PSFS to document and monitor patient-identified rehabilitation goals in patients receiving subacute stroke rehabilitation when applied using a shared decision approach.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) has been used to assess physical functioning in various chronic pain populations. There is a lack of evidence for its use with diverse pain populations who have high-impact chronic pain (HICP). The primary aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the PSFS with a heterogeneous sample of patients with HICP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study of prospective functional outcomes collected before and after participation in an intensive pain management program: PSFS, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, Lower Extremity Functional Scale, Neck Disability Index, Oswestry Disability Index, multidimensional patient impression of change, pain intensity, pain limitation, and fear-avoidance from the charts of 509 intensive pain management program completers. The reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the PSFS were analyzed using Cronbach {$\alpha$}, Pearson correlations, and receiver operating characteristics. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were found for all outcomes after program participation (all P {$<$} 0.0001). Correlations of the PSFS with similar outcomes (convergent validity) were lower than expected ( r = 0.16 to 0.33). A low correlation ( r = -0.12) with an unrelated measure, fear avoidance, supported divergent validity. PSFS change score correlations with similar outcome measures ranged from 0.46 to 0.53. The area under the curve values for the PSFS ranged from 0.801 to 0.857, suggesting a moderate ability for the PSFS to detect improvement. DISCUSSION: The psychometric properties of the PSFS showed mixed support for construct validity but good support for the responsiveness of the PSFS when used with a heterogeneous sample of patients with HICP.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Clinical measurement, longitudinal; multicenter prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To examine the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) in patients with musculoskeletal upper extremity problems being treated in physical therapy. BACKGROUND: The clinimetric properties of the PSFS have not been established nor compared with region-specific outcome measures in patients with upper extremity problems. METHODS: Patients completed the PSFS, Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI), and numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) at baseline and follow-up, and were categorized as improved, stable, or worsened, using the global rating of change. Construct validity was assessed by comparing the change scores of the stable and improved groups, using independent-samples t tests. Reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1) with 95\% confidence intervals. Bland-Altman plots determined limits of agreement. Responsiveness and minimal important difference (MID) were determined with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: One hundred eighty patients met the inclusion criteria. Construct validity was supported for the PSFS and the UEFI (P{$<$}.001). Reliability was moderate to good for the PSFS (ICC2,1 = 0.713) and UEFI (ICC2,1 = 0.848). Reported estimates of reliability may be lower than true values because the group of "stable" patients from this cohort had, on average, a small positive change. Bland-Altman plots indicated good agreement. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was significantly different from the null value of 0.5 for the PSFS (0.887) and the UEFI (0.877), indicating good accuracy in distinguishing improved patients from stable patients. MID was 1.2 for the PSFS (scale, 0-10) and 8.5 for the UEFI (scale, 0-80). CONCLUSION: The PSFS is a valid, reliable, and responsive outcome measure for patients with upper extremity problems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) is an individualized patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess the limitations and changes in self-determined functional activities most important to an older patient in the acute care setting. However, its clinimetric properties have not yet been evaluated in these patients. The study aimed to investigate the construct validity, test-retest reliability, sensitivity to change, and feasibility of the PSFS in acutely hospitalized older patients with and without cognitive impairment (CI). METHODS: The clinimetric properties of the PSFS were investigated by secondary data analysis from a prospective observational cohort study examining physical activity and mobility in acutely hospitalized older patients. In this analysis, 120 older patients-83.0 (6.4) years-with and without CI (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score 18-23, n = 52, and MMSE {$\geq$}24, n = 68, respectively) receiving early multidisciplinary geriatric rehabilitation in acute care were included. Construct validity was assessed by Spearman correlations (rs) with the Activity-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC-6), Short Falls Efficacy Scale-International (Short FES-I), EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), de Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI), and Barthel Index (BI); test-retest reliability within 24 hours by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs); sensitivity to change by standardized response means (SRMs) calculated for treatment effects, and feasibility by completion rates/times and floor/ceiling effects. RESULTS: The PSFS showed fair to moderate correlations with all construct variables in patients with CI (rs = 0.31 to 0.53). In patients without CI, correlations were fair for the ABC-6, FES-I, EQ-5D, and BI (rs = {\textbar}0.27 to 0.36{\textbar}), but low for the SPPB and DEMMI (rs =-0.04 to 0.14). Test-retest reliability (both: ICC = 0.76) and sensitivity to change (CI: SRM = 1.10, non-CI: SRM = 0.89) were excellent in both subgroups. Excellent feasibility was documented by high completion rates ({$>$}94\%), brief completion times ({$<$}8 min), and no floor/ceiling effects in either subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: The PSFS has adequate clinimetric properties for assessing patient-specific functional limitations and changes in acutely hospitalized older patients with and without CI. It might be an appropriate complement to traditional functional scales to enhance patient-centeredness in clinical geriatric assessment.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature. OBJECTIVE: To summarize peer-reviewed literature on the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), and to identify its use as an outcome measure. METHODS: Searches were performed of several electronic databases from 1995 to May 2010. Studies included were published articles containing (1) primary research investigating the psychometric and clinimetrics of the PSFS or (2) the implementation of the PSFS as an outcome measure. We assessed the methodological quality of studies included in the first category. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-two articles published from 1994 to May 2010 were identified. Of these, 66 met the inclusion criteria for this review, with 13 reporting the measurement properties of the PSFS, 55 implementing the PSFS as an outcome measure, and 2 doing both of the above. The PSFS was reported to be valid, reliable, and responsive in populations with knee dysfunction, cervical radiculopathy, acute low back pain, mechanical low back pain, and neck dysfunction. The PSFS was found to be reliable and responsive in populations with chronic low back pain. The PSFS was also reported to be valid, reliable, or responsive in individuals with a limited number of acute, subacute, and chronic conditions. This review found that the PSFS is also being used as an outcome measure in many other conditions, despite a lack of published evidence supporting its validity in these conditions. CONCLUSION: Although the use of the PSFS as an outcome measure is increasing in physiotherapy practice, there are gaps in the research literature regarding its validity, reliability, and responsiveness in many health conditions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study's purpose was to investigate the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) for measuring mobility-related goals in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Data from 32 participants with MS who underwent 8 to 10 weeks of rehabilitation were analyzed (Expanded Disability Status Scale scores 1.0-7.0). For the PSFS, participants identified 3 mobility-related areas where they had difficulty and rated them at baseline, 10 to 14 days later (before starting intervention), and immediately after intervention. Test-retest reliability and response stability of the PSFS were calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2,1 ) and minimal detectable change (MDC 95 ), respectively. Concurrent validity of the PSFS was determined with the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) and the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (T25FW). PSFS responsiveness was determined using Cohen's d , and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was calculated based on patient-reported improvements on a Global Rating of Change (GRoC) scale. RESULTS: The PSFS total score demonstrated moderate reliability (ICC 2,1 = 0.70, 95\% CI: 0.46 to 0.84) and the MDC was 2.1 points. At baseline, the PSFS was fairly and significantly correlated with the MSWS-12 ( r = -0.46, P = 0.008) but not with the T25FW. Changes in the PSFS were moderately and significantly correlated with the GRoC scale ({$\rho$} = 0.63, P {$<$} 0.001), but not with MSWS-12 or T25FW changes. The PSFS was responsive ( d = 1.7), and the MCID was 2.5 points or more to identify patient-perceived improvements based on the GRoC scale (sensitivity = 0.85, specificity = 0.76). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of the PSFS as an outcome measure in people with MS to assess mobility-related goals.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A423 ).},

We performed both quantitative and qualitative syntheses in which the results were summarized on the basis of the reported measurement properties and study quality. Results: Ten eligible studies were included. The pooled PSFS reliability measure was excellent (intra-class correlation coefficient~=~0.89; 95\% CI: 0.75, 0.95). Validity measures displayed correlations that ranged from -0.47 to 0.69 when compared with other patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) or other tests. Eight studies had assessed the responsiveness of the PSFS. Effect sizes reported were large ({$\geq~$}0.91).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Generic upper extremity disability questionnaires utilize standardized items. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) allows the patient to identify specific self-reported items. This study evaluated the validity of the PSFS to assess outcome in patients with hand fractures or dislocations. METHODS: Adults with hand fractures or dislocations, who completed hand therapy between January 2012 and January 2013, were eligible for inclusion. At the initial and final assessment, each patient was asked to complete the PSFS. Each patient identified three items that were difficult or they were unable to perform, and the degree of difficulty was ranked from 0 to 10 (able to perform at pre-injury level). We excluded patients with an incomplete PSFS. Statistical analyses evaluated the relationships between the PSFS and the independent variables. RESULTS: There were 63 patients (37 men, 26 women); 21 of the 63 patients underwent surgery for fracture fixation. The mean duration of hand therapy treatment was 2.2\,{\textpm}\,1.4~months. The mean PSFS scores were as follows: initial 3.2\,{\textpm}\,2.2; final 8.1\,{\textpm}\,2.2. There was a significant improvement in PSFS scores from initial to final assessment (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and a moderate correlation (r\,=\,0.3, p\,=\,0.02). There was no statistical difference in PSFS scores between men and women or surgery and no surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with hand fractures or dislocations, the PSFS indicated significant improvement in function. Using items identified by the patient, the PSFS provides a valuable perspective of outcome and may be used in conjunction with generic disease-specific questionnaire for assessment of the upper extremity.},

DESIGN: Systematic review of a patient-reported outcome measure using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) guidelines. LITERATURE SEARCH: We searched 11 databases from January 2010 to July 2020 for articles on measurement properties or use of PSFS. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Published primary articles without language restrictions. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers screened all records, extracted data, and performed risk of bias assessments using COSMIN guidelines. We qualitatively synthesized findings for each measurement property in musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal conditions, and 2 reviewers independently performed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation assessments. This study was preregistered with the Open Science Framework (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/42UZT). RESULTS: Of the 985 articles screened, we included 57 articles on measurement properties and 255 articles on the use of PSFS. The PSFS had sufficient test-retest reliability in musculoskeletal (22 studies, 845 participants, low-to-moderate certainty) and nonmusculoskeletal conditions (6 studies, 197 participants, very low certainty), insufficient construct validity as a measure of physical function (21 studies, 2 945 participants, low-to-moderate certainty), and sufficient responsiveness (32 studies, 13 770 participants, moderate-to-high certainty). The standard error of measurement ranged from 0.35 to 1.5. The PSFS was used in 87 unique health conditions, some without prior evidence of validity. CONCLUSION: The PSFS is an easy-to-use, reliable, and responsive scale in numerous musculoskeletal conditions, but the construct validity of PSFS remains uncertain. Further study of the measurement properties of the PSFS in nonmusculoskeletal conditions is necessary before clinical use. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2022;52(5):262-275.

  abstract = {Self-report measures of disability are being used more frequently to assess patients' outcomes in clinical practice. This study examines the reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale when applied to persons with neck dysfunction. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale and Neck Disability Index were applied at the initial visit, within 72 hours of the initial visit, and following 1-4 weeks of treatment in 31 patients with cervical dysfunction. At the time of the initial visit, the clinician made an estimate of patients' prognoses on a five-point scale. This estimate served as an priori construct for change: patients with better ratings would change more. The results demonstrate excellent reliability (R = .92) validity (r = .73-.83 compared with the Neck Disability Index, and r = .52-.64 compared with the prognosis rating), and sensitivity of change (r = .79-.83 compared with Neck Disability Index change scores, and r = .46-.53 compared with the prognosis rating). No difference was found between the Patient-Specific Functional Scale and Neck Disability Index in their ability to detect change over time. The results of this study are consistent with previous investigations which have concluded that the Patient-Specific Functional Scale is an efficient and valid measure for assessing disability and change in disability in persons with low back pain and knee dysfunction.},
