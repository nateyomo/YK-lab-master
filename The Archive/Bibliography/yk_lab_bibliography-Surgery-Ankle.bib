  abstract = {The modified Brostr{\"o}m procedure (MBP) is an initial treatment for symptomatic chronic ankle instability (CAI) patients. This study aimed to compare the proprioception and neuromuscular control ability of both affected and unaffected ankles at the time of return to sports after MBP for patients with scores of normal controls. 75 individuals (40 who underwent MBP, 35 normal controls) participated. The dynamic balance test scores were significantly higher in the affected ankle of the patients than in the controls (1.5\,{\textpm}\,0.6{$^\circ$} vs. 1.1\,{\textpm}\,0.4{$^\circ$}, p\,{$<$}\,0.003). The time to peak torque for dorsiflexion (60.8\,{\textpm}\,13.9~ms vs. 52.2\,{\textpm}\,17.5~ms, p\,{$<$}\,0.022) and eversion (68.9\,{\textpm}\,19.1~ms vs. 59.3\,{\textpm}\,21.1~ms, p\,{$<$}\,0.043) was significantly delayed in the affected ankle of the patients than in the controls. The dynamic balance test and time to peak torque in CAI patients remained significantly reduced at the time of return-to-sport after MBP. Clinicians and therapists should be aware of potential deficits in proprioception and neuromuscular control when determining the timing of return to sports after MBP.},
