Initial emphasis is placed on clinical history, examination, diagnostic testing, and medical decision making, while subsequent focus is placed on examining specific inflammatory optic neuropathies. Clinical clues, examination findings, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing that differentiate autoimmune, granulomatous, demyelinating, infectious, and paraneoplastic causes of optic neuritis are assessed, and current treatments are evaluated.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in technology and immunology have enhanced our understanding of the pathologies driving inflammatory optic nerve injury. Clinicians are now able to interrogate optic nerve structure and function during inflammatory injury, rapidly identify disease-relevant autoimmune targets, and deliver timely therapeutics to improve visual outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Optic neuritis is a common clinical manifestation of central nervous system inflammation. Depending on the etiology, visual prognosis and the risk for recurrent injury may vary. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of optic neuritis may be critical for limiting vision loss, future neurologic disability, and organ damage. This article will aid neurologists in formulating a systematic approach to patients with optic neuritis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The contribution of rods and cones to the pupillary light reflex has long been known. A third photosensitive cell type, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell, has recently been discovered. This cell type employs melanopsin to mediate a portion of the pupillary light reflex independent of rods and cones (the postillumination pupillary response) and photic regulation of circadian rhythm.                                         SUMMARY               The autonomic nervous system regulates pupil size in response to stimuli. The parasympathetic nervous system causes miosis in response to light and near visual stimuli. These stimuli activate supranuclear pathways that project to the Edinger-Westphal nuclei. The sympathetic nervous system causes mydriasis in response to a variety of arousing factors, both physiologic (wakefulness) and pathologic (pain). Abnormalities of physiologic function cause disturbances of pupil size, shape, and response to stimuli. The clinical approach to pupillary abnormalities should focus on the clinical and pharmacologic assessment of the pupil's expected response to diverse stimuli.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains an important cause of mortality and long-term morbidity. This article uses a case-based approach to guide readers through the fundamental epidemiology and pathogenesis of SAH, the approach to diagnosis and management, the results of clinical trials and evidence to date, prognostic considerations, controversies, recent developments, and future directions in SAH.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Historically, management of SAH focused on prevention and treatment of subsequent cerebral vasospasm, which was thought to be the primary cause of delayed cerebral ischemia. Clinical and translational studies over the past decade, including several therapeutic phase 3 randomized clinical trials, suggest that the pathophysiology of SAH-associated brain injury is multiphasic and multifactorial beyond large vessel cerebral vasospasm. The quest to reduce SAH-associated brain injury and improve outcomes is shifting away from large vessel cerebral vasospasm to a new paradigm targeting multiple brain injury mechanisms, including early brain injury, delayed cerebral ischemia, microcirculatory dysfunction, spreading cortical depolarization, inflammation, and the brain-body interaction in vascular brain injury with critical illness.               Despite multiple negative randomized clinical trials in search of potential therapeutic agents ameliorating the downstream effects after SAH, the overall outcome of SAH has improved over recent decades, likely related to improvements in interventional options for ruptured cerebral aneurysms and in critical care management. Emerging clinical evidence also suggests potential harmful impact of historic empiric treatments for SAH-associated vasospasm, such as prophylactic induction of hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution (triple H therapy).               With decreasing mortality, long-term SAH survivorship and efforts to reduce chronic morbidity and to improve quality of life and patient-centered outcome are growing areas of unmet need. Despite existing guidelines, significant variabilities in local and regional practices and in scientific terminologies have historically limited advancement in SAH care and therapeutic development. Large global collaborative efforts developed harmonized SAH common data elements in 2019, and studies are under way to examine how existing variabilities in SAH care impact long-term SAH outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Although the overall incidence and mortality of SAH is decreasing with advances in preventive and acute care, SAH remains a major cause of long-term morbidity in survivors. Significant variabilities in care settings and empiric treatment protocols and inconsistent scientific terminologies have limited advancement in patient care and therapeutic clinical studies. Large consensus efforts are under way to introduce clinical guidelines and common data elements to advance therapeutic approaches and improve patient outcome.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although death determination should be consistent among physicians and across hospitals, states, and countries to ensure that someone who is declared dead in one place would not be considered alive elsewhere, variability exists in the prerequisites, clinical evaluation, apnea testing, and use of ancillary testing to evaluate for BD/DNC. Confusion also exists about performance of an evaluation for BD/DNC in challenging clinical scenarios, such as for a patient who is on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or a patient who was treated with therapeutic hypothermia. This prompted the creation of the World Brain Death Project, which published an international consensus statement on BD/DNC that has been endorsed by five world federations and 27 medical societies from across the globe.                                         SUMMARY               The World Brain Death Project consensus statement is intended to provide guidance for professional societies and countries to revise or develop their own protocols on BD/DNC, taking into consideration local laws, culture, and resource availability; however, it does not replace local medical standards. To that end, pending publication of an updated guideline on determination of BD/DNC across the lifespan, the currently accepted medical standards for BD/DNC in the United States are the 2010 American Academy of Neurology standard for determination of BD/DNC in adults and the 2011 Society of Critical Care Medicine/American Academy of Pediatrics/Child Neurology Society standard for determination of BD/DNC in infants and children.},

It also provides a brief introduction to the concept of the glymphatic system and select cellular contributors to cerebral edema.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Cerebral edema and brain compression should be treated in a tiered approach after the patient demonstrates a symptomatic indication to start treatment. All patients with acute brain injury should be treated with standard measures to optimize intracranial compliance and minimize risk of ICP elevation. When ICP monitors are used, therapies should target maintaining ICP at 22 mm Hg or less. Evidence exists that serial clinical examination and neuroimaging may be a reasonable alternative to ICP monitoring; however, clinical trials in progress may demonstrate advantages to advanced monitoring techniques. Early decompressive craniectomy and hypothermia are not neuroprotective in traumatic brain injury and should be reserved for situations refractory to initial medical interventions. Medical therapies that acutely lower plasma osmolality may lead to neurologic deterioration from osmotic cerebral edema, and patients with acute brain injury and renal or liver failure are at elevated risk.                                         SUMMARY               A tiered approach to the management of cerebral edema and brain compression can reduce secondary brain injury when implemented according to core physiologic principles. However, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute brain injury is incomplete, and the conceptual framework underlying decades of clinical management may need to be revised in response to currently evolving discoveries regarding the pathophysiology of acute brain injury.},

Neurologic outcome prediction, or neuroprognostication, is a complex undertaking with many important ramifications. It allows patients with good prognoses to be supported aggressively, survive, and recover; conversely, it avoids inappropriate prolonged and costly care in those with devastating injuries.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Striving to maintain a high prediction performance during prognostic assessments encompasses acknowledging the shortcomings of this task and the challenges created by advances in medicine, which constantly shift the natural history of neurologic conditions. Embracing the unknowns of outcome prediction and the boundaries of knowledge surrounding neurologic recovery and plasticity is a necessary step toward refining neuroprognostication practices and improving the accuracy of prognostic impressions. The pillars of modern neuroprognostication include comprehensive characterization of neurologic injury burden (primary and secondary injuries), gauging cerebral resilience and estimated neurologic reserve, and tying it all together with individual values surrounding the acceptable extent of disability and the difficulties of an arduous convalescence journey.

Such pathology most often affects the anterior portion of the nerve and is visible on funduscopic examination. Ischemic optic neuropathy is associated with typical vascular risk factors and with one systemic disease in particular: giant cell arteritis (GCA). This article provides an overview of the three major classes of ischemic optic neuropathy, including information on risk factors, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Optical coherence tomography provides precise anatomic imaging in ischemic optic neuropathy, showing neural loss weeks before it is visible on examination. Refinements of optical coherence tomography reveal optic nerve microvasculature and may assist in understanding pathogenesis and verifying diagnosis. New diagnostic algorithms and cranial vascular imaging techniques help define the likelihood of GCA in patients with ischemic optic neuropathy. Finally, intraocular drug and biological agent delivery holds promise for nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, whereas newer immunologic agents may provide effective steroid-sparing treatment for GCA.                                         SUMMARY               It is essential to recognize ischemic optic neuropathy upon presentation, especially to determine the likelihood of GCA and the need for immediate steroid therapy.

RECENT FINDINGS               In vitro and in vivo studies have better elucidated the neurotropism of various respiratory viruses. Understanding host cell receptors that mediate viral binding and entry not only demonstrates how viruses enter host cells but also provides possible mechanisms for therapeutic interventions. Elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 binding and fusion with host cells expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor may also provide greater insights into its systemic and neurologic sequelae.

SUMMARY               Understanding the anatomic and physiologic principles of acute brain injury is necessary in managing moderate to severe TBI. Management is based on the prevention of secondary brain injury from resultant trauma. Care of patients with TBI should occur in a dedicated critical care unit with subspecialty expertise. With the advent of multimodality monitoring and targeted biomarkers in TBI, patient outcomes have a higher probability of improving in the future.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Initial screening EEG has been validated as a tool to predict which patients are at risk of future seizures. However, accepted definitions of seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus encourage a treatment trial when the diagnosis on EEG is indeterminate because of periodic or rhythmic patterns or uncertain clinical correlation. Similarly, recent data have demonstrated the diagnostic utility of intracranial EEG in increasing the yield of seizure detection. EEG has additionally been validated as a diagnostic biomarker of covert consciousness, a predictive biomarker of cerebral ischemia and impending neurologic deterioration, and a prognostic biomarker of coma recovery and status epilepticus resolution. A recent randomized trial concluded that patients allocated to continuous EEG had no difference in mortality than those undergoing intermittent EEG but could not demonstrate whether this lack of difference was because of studying heterogeneous conditions, examining a monitoring tool rather than a therapeutic approach, or examining an outcome measure (mortality) perhaps more strongly associated with early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy than to a sustained response to pharmacotherapy.                                         SUMMARY               Seizures and status epilepticus are events of synchronous hypermetabolic activity that are either discrete and intermittent or, alternatively, continuous. Seizures and status epilepticus represent the far end of a continuum of ictal-interictal patterns that include lateralized rhythmic delta activity and periodic discharges, which not only predict future seizures but may be further classified as status epilepticus on the basis of intracranial EEG monitoring or a diagnostic trial of antiseizure medication therapy. In particularly challenging cases, neuroimaging or multimodality neuromonitoring may be a useful adjunct documenting metabolic crisis. Specialized uses of EEG as a prognostic biomarker have emerged in traumatic brain injury for predicting language function and covert consciousness, cardiac arrest for predicting coma recovery, and subarachnoid hemorrhage for predicting neurologic deterioration due to delayed cerebral ischemia.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article discusses neurologic complications encountered in the postoperative care of neurosurgical patients that are common or key to recognize in the immediate postoperative period. The major neurosurgical subspecialty procedures (cerebrovascular neurosurgery, neuro-oncology, epilepsy neurosurgery, functional neurosurgery, CSF diversion, endovascular neurosurgery, and spinal surgery) are broadly included under craniotomy procedures, endovascular/vascular procedures, and spinal procedures. This article focuses on the range of complications inherent in these approaches with specific scenarios addressed as applicable.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The morbidity and mortality related to neurosurgical procedures remains high, necessitating ongoing research and quality improvement efforts in perioperative screening, intraoperative management, surgical approaches, and postoperative care of these patients. Emerging research continues to investigate safer and newer options for routine neurosurgical approaches, such as coiling over clipping for amenable aneurysms, endoscopic techniques for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, and minimally invasive spinal procedures; postoperative monitoring and care of patients after these procedures continues to be a key component in the continuum of care for improving outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Postoperative care of patients undergoing major neurosurgical procedures is an integral part of many neurocritical care practices. Neurosurgeons often enlist help from neurologists to assist with evaluation, interpretation, and management of complications in routine inpatient settings. Awareness of the common neurologic complications of various neurosurgical procedures can help guide appropriate clinical monitoring algorithms and quality improvement processes for timely evaluation and management of these patients.},

RECENT FINDINGS               PRES and RCVS are descriptive terms, each bringing together conditions with similar clinical-imaging manifestations. Headache, visual symptoms, seizures, and confusion occur in both syndromes. RCVS is usually heralded by recurrent thunderclap headaches, whereas encephalopathy and seizures are typical in PRES. In PRES, brain imaging shows reversible vasogenic edema that is typically symmetric and located in subcortical regions (mostly posterior predominant). In RCVS, brain imaging is often normal; cerebral angiography shows segmental vasoconstriction-vasodilatation affecting the circle of Willis arteries and their branches. Aside from shared clinical features, significant imaging overlap exists. Both PRES and RCVS can be complicated by ischemic and hemorrhagic brain lesions; angiographic abnormalities frequently occur in PRES and vasogenic edematous lesions in RCVS. Common triggers (eg, eclampsia, vasoconstrictive and chemotherapeutic agents) have been identified. Abnormal cerebrovascular tone and endothelial dysfunction may explain both syndromes. Management of these syndromes includes the removal of identified triggers, symptomatic treatment of headache or seizures, and moderate blood pressure control. Both syndromes are self-limited, with clinical recovery occurring within days to weeks. Long-term deficits and mortality are uncommon.                                         SUMMARY               PRES and RCVS have been well characterized and acknowledged to have significant overlap. Advances in our understanding of pathophysiology and risk factors for poor outcome are expected to optimize the management of these not uncommon syndromes.},
