  abstract = {CONTEXT: Combat sports are typically divided into weight classes, and body-mass manipulation to reach a weight class is commonplace. Previous research suggests that weight loss practices in mixed martial arts (MMA) may be more extreme than in other combat sports. PURPOSE: To investigate the magnitude of weight loss and the prevalence of weight loss strategies in different combat sports. METHODS: Competitors (N\,=\,637) from Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, judo, MMA, Muay Thai/kickboxing, taekwondo, and wrestling completed an online questionnaire seeking information regarding their weight loss practices. RESULTS: Body-mass manipulation was commonly undertaken by all combat-sport athletes, with a particularly high incidence of gradual dieting, increased exercise, and fluid restriction. Skipping meals was higher in taekwondo and wrestling (84\%) compared with the other combat sports ({$\sim$}58\%), whereas training in heated rooms and forced oral fluid loss (spitting) was higher in wrestling (83\% and 47\%, respectively) compared with other combat sports ({$\sim$}45\% and {$\sim$}19\%, respectively). MMA athletes reported the highest usage of sauna (76\%) and water loading (67\%) while also reporting the second-highest use of training in rubber/plastic suits (63\%). CONCLUSIONS: Body-mass manipulation was present in all combat sports, with the prevalence and magnitude of acute weight loss greater in MMA. The incidence of and practices reported will help support staff be fully aware of the variety of methods these athletes and coaches may use to achieve weight loss. Additionally, the results could aid regulatory bodies in the further development of policies on weight cutting.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a combat sport underpinned by techniques from other combat disciplines, in addition to strategies unique to the sport itself. These sports can be divided into two distinct categories (grappling or striking) based on differing technical demands. Uniquely, MMA combines both methods of combat and therefore appears to be physiologically complex requiring a spectrum of mechanical and metabolic qualities to drive performance. However, little is known about the physiological characteristics that distinguish higher- from lower-level MMA athletes. Such information provides guidance for training interventions, performance testing and talent identification. Furthermore, while MMA incorporates techniques from both grappling and striking sports, it is unknown precisely how these disciplines differ physiologically. Understanding the relationship between higher-level competitors in grappling and striking combat sports can provide further insight into the development of the optimal performance profile of a higher-level MMA athlete. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to analyse the scientific literature on MMA and the primary combat sports underpinning it to determine the physiological adaptations that distinguish superior competitors, with a view to defining the optimal physiological profile for higher-level MMA performance. Furthermore, this article will explore the differences in these capabilities between grappling- and striking-based combat sports in the context of MMA. METHODS: A literature search was undertaken via PubMed, Web of Science, SportDiscus and Google Scholar. The following sports were included for systematic review based on their relevance to MMA: mixed martial arts, boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, judo, karate, kickboxing, Muay Thai and wrestling. The inclusion criteria allowed studies that compared athletes of differing competition levels in the same sport using a physiological performance measure. Only male, adult (aged 17-40~years), able-bodied competitors were included. The search history spanned from the earliest record until September 2015. RESULTS: Of the eight combat sports searched for, five were represented across 23 studies. Sixteen investigations described maximal strength or neuromuscular power variables, while 19 articles reported anaerobic or aerobic measures. The results indicate that a number of strength, neuromuscular power and anaerobic variables distinguished higher- from lower-level combat sport athletes. However, these differences were less clear when groups were stratified within, rather than between competition grades. Greater aerobic power was generally not present amongst superior combat sport competitors. CONCLUSION: There appear to be differing physiological profiles between more successful grappling and striking combat sport athletes. This is represented by high-force demands of grappling sports causing an upwards shift of the entire force-velocity relationship driven by an increase in maximal strength. In comparison, smaller increases in maximal force production with more notable enhancements in lighter load, higher velocity actions may better identify superior performance in striking sports. Anaerobic capabilities largely distinguished higher- from lower-level combat sport athletes. In particular, longer-term anaerobic efforts seem to define successful grappling-based athletes, while superior competitors in striking sports tend to show dominance in shorter-term measures when compared with their lower-level counterparts. Given the demand for both forms of combat in MMA, a spectrum of physiological markers may characterize higher-level competitors. Furthermore, the performance profile of successful MMA athletes may differ based on combat sport history or competition strategy.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Some methods such as ergo nutritional aids, cooling or massage among others could improve recovery in combat sports (CS). The effects, doses, duration, and timing of these methods remains unknown. Nowadays, there is no clear consensus regarding the recovery strategies and it is necessary to understand the type of fatigue induced in CS and its underlying mechanisms. The main aim of this article is to review the update literature related to recovery strategies in CS. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search was conducted following preferred reporting items for review statement on the topic of: "combat sports," "recovery," "nutrition," "fatigue," "ergogenic aids," "weight cutting" and "hydration." EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The initial search of the literature detected 369 articles about CS. Later, 307 were excluded after being determined unrelated to recovery or after failure to fulfill the inclusion criteria. Of the 80 included articles, 19 satisfied the final inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: To optimize CS performance, adequate recovery is required during training and competition processes. Traditional ergo nutritional supplementation of carbohydrates and proteins combined. Besides, the consumption of evidence supported supplementation (green tea, beetroot gels, creatine or alkaline water) improve recovery processes. Further methods of recovery including physical (cold water immersion, massage or photobiomodulation) and physiological (types of active recovery, sleep and rest) therapies have also been shown useful. This narrative review elucidates the important role of recovery techniques in CS.},

  abstract = {Vasconcelos, BB, Protzen, GV, Galliano, LM, Kirk, C, and Del Vecchio, FB. Effects of high-intensity interval training in combat sports: A systematic review with meta-analysis. J Strength Cond Res 34(3): 888-900, 2020-Combat sports (CS) are intermittent by nature and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been used as a tool to maintain and improve physical fitness among CS athletes. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis about chronic effects of HIIT in CS athletes. An electronic search was performed in PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar using the following Boolean criteria: ("CS" OR "martial arts" OR "judo" OR "taekwondo" OR "jiu jitsu" OR "boxing" OR "karate" OR "wrestling" OR "wushu" OR "kung fu") AND ("HIIT" OR "intermittent exercise" OR "sprint interval training" OR "repeated sprint training [RST]"). To be included, the studies needed to be original, involve CS athletes, present HIIT intervention protocol (HIIT, sprint interval training [SIT] or RST), and analyze chronic physiological outcomes. From 2,211 identified studies, after screening and eligibility evaluation, 12 studies were included in this review with meta-analysis. Aerobic (aerobic capacity, heart rate, and maximum oxygen uptake), anaerobic (peak and mean power in single and successive Wingate tests, and blood lactate concentration), and anthropometric outcomes (body mass and body fat percentage) were evaluated. Data of 255 subjects from 12 studies were assessed. Regarding methodological quality, 7 studies obtained 9-10/12 on the TESTEX scale. For the interventions, 5 studies used HIIT, 4 studies used RST protocols, one used SIT protocols, and one used an intermittent protocol that could not be classified. Relating to aerobic power, was found an increase in V[Combining Dot Above]O2max, with a mean difference (MD) of 2.83 ml{$\cdot$}kg{$\cdot$}min (CI 95\% = 0.40-5.25; p {$<$} 0.001) for striking and 2.36 ml{$\cdot$}kg{$\cdot$}min (CI 95\% = 1.05-3.66; p {$<$} 0.001) for grappling athletes. No differences on anaerobic peak power for striking (MD = 0.67 W; CI 95\% = -0.43 to 1.77; p = 0.23) were found, and a statistical improvement for grappling athletes, (MD = 0.51 W; CI 95\% = 0.03-0.98; p = 0.04) was found. Seven studies analyzed anthropometric variables, with differences for body mass in striking (MD = -0.93 kg; CI 95\% = -1.68 to -0.19; p = 0.01) and no differences for grappling (MD = -0.09 kg; CI 95\% = -2.80 to 2.62; p = 0.95). Differences in body fat percentage in striking (MD = 0.50\%; CI 95\% = 0.30-0.70; p {$<$} 0.001) and no differences in grappling (MD = -0.87\%; CI 95\% = -1.77 to 0.03; p = 0.06) were found. It was concluded that HIIT positively influences maximum oxygen uptake and anaerobic power in combat sport athletes, with a minor impact on body composition.},
