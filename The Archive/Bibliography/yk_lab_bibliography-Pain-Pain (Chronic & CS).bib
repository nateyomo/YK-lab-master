  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The identification of central sensitization (CS) is an important aspect in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Several methods have been developed, including clinical indicators and psychophysical measures. However, whether clinical indicators coincide with the psychophysical test of CS-related sign and symptoms is still unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical indicators in identifying CS-related sign and symptoms in patients with musculoskeletal pain.                                         Methods               One-hundred consecutive patients with musculoskeletal pain were included. Clinical indicators (index method) based on a combination of patient self-report pain characteristics and physical examination were used to identify the phenotype of patients with musculoskeletal pain and the predominance of the CS-related sign and symptoms. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) was assessed by the Cold Pressor Test (reference standard), which is a psychophysical test used to detect impairment of CPM. Measurements of the diagnostic accuracy were performed.                                         Results               Twenty-seven patients presented predominance of CS-related sign and symptoms in the assessment of the clinical indicators, and 20 had impairment of CPM. Clinical indicators showed high accuracy (75.0\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,65.3 to 83.1), high specificity (80.0\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,69.6 to 88.1), high negative predictive value (87.7\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,81.2 to 92.1), and a relevant positive likelihood ratio (2.8, 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.5 to 5.0) when compared to the Cold Pressor Test.                                         Conclusion               Clinical indicators demonstrated a valuable tool for detecting the impaired CPM, which is a remarkable feature of the CS-related sign and symptoms. Clinicians are encouraged to use the clinical indicators in the management of patients with musculoskeletal pain.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are commonly reported by individuals with chronic pain. However, little is known about how ACE exposure influences treatment outcomes. The goal of the current study was to evaluate group and treatment-related differences among adults with varying levels of ACE exposure participating in a pain rehabilitation treatment program. METHODS: Adult participants (N=269) were categorized as 0 ACEs (n=65), 1 to 2 ACEs (n=87), or {$\geq$}3 ACEs (n=117). Participants completed self-report measures of pain, physical functioning, and psychosocial functioning at intake and discharge from a 10-week interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program. RESULTS: ACE exposure was frequently endorsed in this sample, with the majority of participants (78.5\%) reporting at least 1 form of childhood adversity. Adults in the {$\geq$}3 ACEs group reported a greater level of impairment in mental health symptoms and adjustment to chronic pain; however, all groups endorsed treatment improvements and there were no differences in response to treatment. There were also no differences between groups on measures of pain or physical functioning at intake or discharge. DISCUSSION: ACE exposure appears common among treatment-seeking adults with chronic pain and is associated with increased clinical complexity. However, adults with and without exposure to ACEs endorsed significant improvements in pain and functioning following participation in an interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program. This model of treatment may be especially well situated to address the biopsychosocial contributions to pain among those with a history of adversity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To collect the available evidence about the effectiveness of pain neuroscience education (PNE) on pain, disability, and psychosocial factors in patients with chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and central sensitization (CS). METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. Searches were performed on Pubmed, PEDro, and CINAHL, and only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients {$\geq$}18 years of age with chronic MSK pain due to CS were included. No meta-analysis was conducted, and qualitative analysis was realized. RESULTS: 15 RCTs were included. Findings were divided for diagnostic criteria (fibromyalgia-FM, chronic fatigue syndrome-CFS, low back pain-LBP, chronic spinal pain-CSP). PNE has been proposed as a single intervention or associated with other approaches, and different measures were used for the main outcomes considered. Conclusions, practice implication: PNE is effective in improving pain, disability, and psychosocial factors in patients with fibromyalgia, chronic low back pain (CLBP)-especially if associated with other therapeutic approaches-and also in patients with CFS and CSP. Overall, PNE seems to be more effective when proposed in one-to-one oral sessions and associated with reinforcement elements. However, specific eligibility criteria for chronic MSK pain due to CS are still lacking in most RCTs; therefore, for future research, it is mandatory to specify such criteria in primary studies.},
