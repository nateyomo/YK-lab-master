# Use case

- Occassional use
- Application at the *inception* of an acute injury

# Problems



:::{.callout title="via Gary Brekka"}

- cytotoxic to fibrobalsts
- ligamentous laxity
- the body naturally brings blood cells to the site of injury, but cortisone blocks this, so you are essnetially preventing natural PRP therapy the body is attempting to perform

"Overuse of cortisone has prematurely ended many professional sport careers, the most notable example being Joe Montana"
