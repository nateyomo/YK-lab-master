title: Bicep Curl Exercise
---



At my internship with *b project*, we used a bicep curl for a variety of reasons.

- We would perform biceps curls seated in order to ensure more focus on the upper extremities and minimizing compensation of the hip and distal regions.
- Function
    - Improve active ROM and strength into elbow flexion
    - Eccentric: *active-assisted range of motion* to achieve full elbow extension

- Hand position
    - Pronated: Brachialis bias
    - Neutral (thumbs up): Brachioradialis bias
    - Supinated: Biceps brachii bias
