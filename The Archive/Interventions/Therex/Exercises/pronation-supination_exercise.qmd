title: Forearm Pronation-Supination exercise
---



- Elbow flexed to 90&deg;
- Hold dumbbell
- Full pronate and supinate the arm
- Adding a 3-5 sec hold at each end range can help to work through full ROM


::: {.callout-note title="Compensations"}

- Watch for shoulder abduction by making sure the elbows stay at one's side the entire time.
    - Shoulder abduction is a compensation for lack of pronation
