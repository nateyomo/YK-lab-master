title: Sidelying Gluteal Activation Exercise
subtitle: Foundational Exercise
---


This exercise is important for glute activation.


- Start sidelying on your contralateral side with your ipsilateral side up.
- Roll forward so you are in a plane halfway between sidelying and prone.
- Keep the top (ipsilateral) leg straight
- Drive the ipsilateral leg vertically towards the ceiling.
    - Since you are between sidelying and prone, achieving purely vertical motion will require hip extension and abduction, which will optimally engage the [gluteus medius]({{< var ref-gluteus-medius.action >}}) and [minimus]({{< var ref-gluteus-minimus.action >}}).


::: {.callout-caution}
If the patient remains in pure sidelying, this will allow them to recruit the TFL alongside the glutes, which we are trying to avoid.
