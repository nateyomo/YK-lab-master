title: Modified Deadlift (MDL)
subtitle: Foundational Exercise
---


The *modified deadlift* is a deadlift variation where the knee is static in active knee extension or slight flexion (~10-0&deg; flexion).
This movement is commonly confused with the *romanian deadlift (RDL)* which also occurs with a static knee position, but the key difference is that the knee position in RDLs is more flexed.


# Bar Path

The *absolute* bar path does not follow a purely vertical line in MDLs.
due to the lack of knee translation, the trunk must translate forward as the hip posteriorly translates.
We do however observe the angle between the wrist and shoulder.
The wrist should remain directly under the shoulder at all times.
