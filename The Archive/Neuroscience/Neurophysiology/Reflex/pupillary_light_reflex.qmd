title: Pupillary Light Reflex
---


Pupillary light reflex is to prevent excess light and cause damage to the eye



If you are shining a light in the left eye, then the L CN2 senses the light and sends afferents to the CN3 and CN3 sends efferents back to both right and left pupils to constrict



# Testing

Shining light in one eye, you expect both eyes to have pupil constriction.


If both eyes have no change in pupil dilation, then this indicates either the ipsilateral CN2 or both CN3 are dysfunctional.

If only the ipsilateral eye constricts, than the contralateral CN3 is dysfunctional.
If only the contralateral eye constricts, than the ipsilateral CN3 is dysfunctional
