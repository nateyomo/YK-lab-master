Multiple sclerosis (MS) refers to a progressive autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks oligodendrocytes resulting in demyelination of the brain, spinal cord, [CNI Olfactory n.]({{< var ref-cn1.path >}}), and [CNII Optic n.]({{< var ref-cn2.path >}}) @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.
MS is characterized by inflammation, selective demyelination, and gliosis @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019. 



# Etiology

:::{layout-ncol="3"}
### Genetics
It appears that although individuals do not inherit the disease, they may inherit a genetic susceptibility to immune system dysfunction


:::

# Pathogenesis

Molecular mimicry

- An autoimmune response when individuals with a genetic susceptibility are exposed to a viral agent @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019


Major Pathologic Mechanisms that result in clinical manifestations @olekManifestationsMultipleSclerosis2023 

- Inflammation @olekManifestationsMultipleSclerosis2023 
- Demyelination @olekManifestationsMultipleSclerosis2023 
- Axonal degeneration @olekManifestationsMultipleSclerosis2023 

## Theories

Theories(Olek and Mowry 2023)

- "The most widely accepted theory is that MS begins as an inflammatory immune-mediated disorder characterized by autoreactive lymphocytes" @olekManifestationsMultipleSclerosis2023 
- "Later, the disease is dominated by microglial activation and chronic neurodegeneration" @olekManifestationsMultipleSclerosis2023

::: {.callout-note}

- Excludes cerebral function grade 1.
- Note 1: EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to patients who are fully ambulatory and the precise step number is defined by the Functional System score(s). EDSS steps 5.0 to 9.5 are defined by the impairment to ambulation and usual equivalents in Functional Systems scores are provided.
- Note 2: EDSS should not change by 1.0 step unless there is a change in the same direction of at least one step in at least one FS.

## Functional systems (FS)

| Pyramidal | P | Motor function |

| Brainstem | BS | |
| Sensory | S | |
| Bowel and Bladder | BB | |
| Visual | V | |

## FS Scoring


The FS are scored on a scale of 0 (low level of problems) to 5 or 6 (high level of problems) to best reflect the level of disability observed clinically.
The “Other” category consists of any other neurologic findings attributed to MS and is dichotomous, with 0 as none and 1 as any present.
In contrast, the total EDSS score is determined by two factors: gait and FS scores.

EDSS scores below 4.0 are determined by the FS scores alone.
People with EDSS scores of 4.0 and above may have some degree of gait impairment. Scores between 4.0 and 9.5 are determined by both gait abilities and the FS scores.
For simplicity, many experts gauge the EDSS scores between 4.0 and 9.5 entirely by gait, without considering the FS scores.
The EDSS is widely used and accepted as a valid tool to clinically measure and evaluate MS patients’ level of functioning.

# Clinical Presentation

- Onset of MS typically occurs between ages 20 and 50 years and is uncommon in children @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019 
- 9% of patients experience sx onset after 50 yeras old @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019 

### Gender

- Prevalence: MS occurs more often in women than men (2-3:1) when sx onset before 50y/o  @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019 
- Severity: Men experience more progressive disease course and more rapid disability @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019
