# Level of injury {#level-of-injury}

Level of injury can be defined using two different anatomical methods:

1. [Vertebral column level](#level-of-injury-vertebral-column)
1. [Spinal cord level](#level-of-injury-spinal-cord-level)

## Vertebral column {#level-of-injury-vertebral-column}

The level of injury could communicated relative to the vertebral column.
For example one could say a spinal cord injury at T12 *vertebral body*.

## Spinal cord level {#level-of-injury-spinal-cord-level}

# Completeness {#completeness}

Completeness of the spinal cord injury refers to how much of the the spinal cord was damaged in the injury.
For example, a "complete" spinal cord injury would injury the entire cross-section and no sensation would be able to come up the spinal cord and no motor would be able to be sent inferior of this section.


# Functional Categories

Spinal cord injuries can be divided into two functional categories: tetraplegia and paraplegia @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019

:::{layout-ncol="2"}

## Tetraplegia

- Motor and/or sensory impairment of all four extremities and trunk @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019
    - Including the respiratory muscles @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019
- Results from lesions of the cervical cord @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019


## Paraplegia

- Motor and/or sensory impairment of all or part of the trunk and both lower extremities (LEs) @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019
- Results from lesions of the thoracic or lumbar spinal cord or cauda equina @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019

# Anatomy

![Spinal Cord Cross section @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019](/The Archive/Neuroscience/Neuroanatomy/Spinal Cord/images/osullivan fig20.1 spinal cord cross section.png)

[Read more about the Anatomy and function of the spinal cord]({{< var ref-spinal-cord.path >}}).



# Determining Lesion Level and Severity

It is important for clinicians to be able to determine lesion level and completeness in order to establish prognosis.
The standardized method to assess this is the [ISNCSCI]({{< var ref-spinal-cord-injury.isncsci >}}).

# Clinical Syndromes

- Clinical syndromes refer to common patterns in SCI presentations @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.
- ~$\frac{1}{5}$ of clinical presentations follow clinical SCI syndromes @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.


:::{.callout-tip title="Clinical Significance"}

Clinicians should use clinical syndromes to anticipate sensory and motor functions, which they can use for goal-setting, predicting outcomes, and guiding the plan of care (POC) @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.

:::{layout-ncol="3"}

### Brown-Sequard Syndrome

- [Brown-Sequard Syndrome]({{< var ref-spinal-cord-injury.brown-sequard-syndrome >}})
- Generally due to penetration injuries
- Hemisection

### Anterior Cord Syndrome

- [Anterior Cord Syndrome]({{< var ref-spinal-cord-injury.anterior-cord-syndrome >}})
- Flexion injury (generally) @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019
- BIL [Corticospinal tract]({{< var ref-lateral-corticospinal-tract.path >}}) damage
- BIL [Spinothalamic tract]({{< var ref-spinothalamic-tract.path >}}) damage
- [DCML]({{< var ref-dorsal-column-medial-lemniscus.path >}}) Preservation


### Central Cord Syndrome

- The most common SCI syndrome @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019
- C/S Hyperextension injury @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019

# Cardiovascular complications

Disruptions of cardiovascular control following spinal cord injury are directly related
to the level and degree of the injury @hagenCardiovascularComplicationsSpinal2012

## Timing

:::{layout-ncol="2"}
### Acute
"Immediately after a spinal cord injury, there is in almost all patients a sudden loss of the autonomic effect of the smooth muscle in the walls of the blood vessels, and as a result vasodilation occurs. The acute loss of sympathetic stimulation results in bradycardia. During the acute phase, the arterial hypotension (neurogenic shock) may be misinterpreted as loss of volume." @hagenCardiovascularComplicationsSpinal2012
:::

## Peripheral Nerves

:::{layout-ncol="3"}

### Vagus Nerve

- The vagus nerve is hypersensitive immediately after an injury @hagenCardiovascularComplicationsSpinal2012.
- This normally lasts for 2–3 weeks, but can last longer @hagenCardiovascularComplicationsSpinal2012.
- Treatment
    - Implantation of a temporary or permanent pacemaker is required.
    - Atropine should be available @hagenCardiovascularComplicationsSpinal2012
- Precautions:
    -  During this period, it is important to avoid activating the n. vagus to avoid reinforcing the vagal reflexes.
    - Avoid Hyperventilation (Hypoxia increases vagal activity) @hagenCardiovascularComplicationsSpinal2012
    - All forms of tube in the nose/mouth and throat may cause bradycardia and increased vagal reflexes @hagenCardiovascularComplicationsSpinal2012.
- This can be a life-long problem in patients with high, complete injuries, whereas in patients with lower and/or incomplete injuries the situation may normalise after 4–5 weeks @hagenCardiovascularComplicationsSpinal2012
:::

## Complete Cervical

"complete cervical injury, the connection between the upper autonomic centres in the brain and the intermediolateral cell column at level T1–L2 of the spinal cord will be destroyed. Patients with cervical injuries have a higher risk of bradycardia (29 %), sudden unprovoked cardiac arrest (16 %) and conduction system disturbances, particularly in the first few weeks after the injury (5). Sudden death is not unusual either." @hagenCardiovascularComplicationsSpinal2012
