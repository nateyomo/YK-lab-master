Abducens nucleus:

- Location: Pontine tegmentum

Pathway: 

- Abducens nucleus -> emerge @ Pontomedullary junction -> Enter cavernous sinus -> superior orbital fissure -> Lateral rectus muscle

- Axons move ventrally (emerge @ junction of pons & Medulla pyramids) -> Enter cavernous sinus -> Enter orbit @ medial end of superior orbital fissure -> innervate ipsilateral LR muscle (Abduction)
