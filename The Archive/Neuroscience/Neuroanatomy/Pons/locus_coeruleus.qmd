title: Locus Coeruleus
---

- Norepinephrine: Main source of NE in brain
    - Pain & Stress response
- Lateral to colliculus facialis
- Blue spot = melanin


# Anatomy

Within the reticular formation



# Input

- Activated by nerves from the Periaqueductal Gray (PAG)

:::{.callout-note}
Opioids inhibit the GABA neuron in the PAG, which increases activation of the nerves coming from the PAG and increasing release of NE by the Locus Coeruleus
