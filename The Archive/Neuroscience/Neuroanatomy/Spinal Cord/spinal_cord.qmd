# Pathway

The spinal cord exits the foramen magnum and extends to approximately the L1 vertebral level @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.

# Composition

The spinal cord is made up of both white and gray matter.

## White matter

- The white matter is solely composed of myelinated nerves
- The majority of the white matter consists of the [ascending (sensory) tracts]({{< var ref-ascending-tracts.path >}}) and [descending (motor) tracts]({{< var ref-descending-tracts.path >}}) @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.
- The rest of the white matter is composed of myelinated axons of interneurons.

## Gray matter

The gray matter is found in the center of the spinal cord with a butterfly shaped horizontal cross section.
The gray matter has 3 divisions:

1. Ventral (Anterior) horn 
1. Intermediate Zone 
1. Dorsal (posterior) horn 

The ventral (anterior) horn of the spinal cord contains the *anterior motor neurons* which 

# Motor Organization

## Anterior motor neurons {#anterior-motor-neuron}

### Alpha Motor Neurons {#alpha-motor-neuron} {#A-alpha-motor-neuron}

The &alpha;-motor neurons give rise to large *type A &alpha;-motor nerve fibers (A&alpha;) which have a diameter of ~14 &micro;m @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
These A&alpha;-motor neurons branch multiple times *after* entering the skeletal muscle and provide innervation to the large skeletal muscle fibers @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
Since a single &alpha;-motor neuron gives rise to the large A&alpha;-motor neurons which branch multiple times, the stimulation of a single &alpha;-motor neuron acn excite up to 100s of skeletal muscle fibers @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

The single &alpha;-motor neuron, its associated large A&alpha;-motor neurons, and all of the skeletal muscle fibers make up a single *motor unit* @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

Transmission of nerve impulses into skeletal muscles the stimulation of a muscle motor unit is discussed more in chapter6 and 7 @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

### Gamma Motor neuron (&gamma;) {#gamma-motor-neuron}

Gamma (&gamma;) motor neurons work alongside [&alpha;-motor neurons](#alpha-motor-neuron) to excite andcontract skeletal muscle fibers @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

&gamma;-motor neurons are much smaller in size and there are 50% less neurons in the *anterior horn* compared to [&alpha;-motor neurons](#alpha-motor-neuron) @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

The &gamma;-motor neurons give rise to even smaller Type-A &gamma;-motor fibers which are ~5&micro;meters in diameter @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
These fibers run to special skeletal muscle fibers known as "intrafusal fibers" @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.
These fibers can be smaller than the [A&alpha;-motor neurons](#A-alpha-motor-neuron) since the intrafusal fibers are much smaller skeletal muscle fibers, compared to extrafusal fibers that the [A&alpha-motor fibers](#A-alpha-motor-neuron) innervate @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

These A&gamma;-motor neurons play a key role in controlling skeletal muscle tone @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

## Interneurons {#interneuron}

"Interneurons. Interneurons are present in all areas of the cord gray matterâ€”in the dorsal horns, the anterior horns, and the intermediate areas between them, as shown in Figure 55-1. These cells are about 30 times as numerous as the anterior motor neurons. They are small and highly excitable, often exhibiting spontaneous activity and capable of firing as rapidly as 1500 times per second. They have many interconnections with one another, and many of them also synapse directly with the anterior motor neurons, as shown in Figure 55-1. The interconnections among the interneurons and anterior motor neurons are responsible for most of the integrative functions of the spinal cord that are discussed in the remainder of this chapter. Essentially all the different types of neuronal circuits described in Chapter 47 are found in the interneuron pool of cells of the spinal cord, including diverging, converging, repetitive-discharge, and other types of circuits. In this chapter, we examine many applications of these different circuits in the performance of specific reflex actions by the spinal cord. Only a few incoming sensory signals from the spinal nerves or signals from the brain terminate directly on the anterior motor neurons. Instead, almost all these signals are transmitted first through interneurons, where they are appropriately processed. Thus, in Figure 55-1, the corticospinal tract from the brain is shown to terminate almost entirely on spinal interneurons, where the signals from this tract are combined with signals from other spinal tracts or spinal nerves before finally converging on the anterior motor neurons to control muscle function." @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021

# Nerve root direction

![Relationship between the spinal cord and nerve roots @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019](/The Archive/Neuroscience/Neuroanatomy/Spinal Cord/images/osullivan fig20.2 spinal cord and nerve roots.png)

One should take note that the nerve root direction changes as you descend the spinal cord.
This is due to differing rates of growth of the spinal cord and vertebral column during development.
Since the vertebral column elongates at a faster rate than the spinal cord, the spinal cord is essentially "drawn upward" @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.
In adults the spinal cord technically ends at L1 in the conus medullaris, but due to the elongation of the vertebral column, the nerve roots must travel inferiorly at an almost vertical direction @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.
This grouping of individual nerve roots travelling inferiorly creates the appearance of a "horse's tail" and is referred to as the "Cauda Equina @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019."

::: {.callout-tip title="Clinical Significance"}
Due to the differing lengths of the spinal cord and vertebral column, more caudal injuries of the vertebral column will not directly correspond to the neurologic level of injury (NLI) @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.
