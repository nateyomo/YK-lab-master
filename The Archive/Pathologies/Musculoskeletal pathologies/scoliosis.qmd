Scoliosis is defined as abnormal curvature of the spine in 3 planes [@schreiberSchrothPhysiotherapeuticScoliosisSpecific2023].
This results in changes in the trunk and intervertebral discs which produce long term structural changes in the vertebrae [@schreiberSchrothPhysiotherapeuticScoliosisSpecific2023].



Scoliosis will consist of a *Convex* and *concave* aspect.




Scoliosis consists of a progressive disturbance of the intercalated series of spinal segments that produces a 3D deformity consisting of lateral curvature (sidebend) with associated rotation @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.


# Prognosis

- The younger the patient, the greater the risk of progression @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- *Double curve* patterns have a greater risk of progressiont han *single curves* @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
- Curves with *greater magnitude* have greater risk of progression @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Females<sup>&female;</sup> have a 10x greater risk of progression than males<sup>&male:</sup> with comporable curvature @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
- Development of curves before *menarche* increases risk of progresion @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.


# Describing Scoliosis

Scoliosis is described based on the **Location** of the curve(s) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
In addition, the **direction** of the convexity and concavity towards the left or right should be detailed @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.

::: {.callout-note}
If there is a *double curve pattern* then both curves should be described @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.

# Biomechanical changes


- Convex will have
    - Elongated back extensors
    - Weak back extensors
    - Rotation of vertebral body *towards* convexity @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
        - Spinous processes move *away* from convexity @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
        - As vertebra rotate towards the convexity, this brings the ribs *posteriorly* on the convex side resulting in a "rib hump" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
    - Ribs are widely spaced @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020


- Concave
    - Shortened back extensors
    - Tight back extensors
    - rotation of vertebral body *away* concavity @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
        - Spinous processes move *towards* concavity @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
        - As vertebra rotate *away* from the concavity, this brings the ribs *anteriorly* on the concave side @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
    - Ribs are *close* together @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020


# Non-Structural Scoliosis

"Nonstructural scoliosis is reversible and can be changed with forward or side bending and with positional changes, such as lying supine, realignment of the pelvis by correction of a leg-length discrepancy, or with muscle contractions. It is also called functional or postural scoliosis." [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018]. 

## Potential Impairments

<ul>
    <li>Hypomobility in joints, muscles, and fascia on the i{concave side} [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018]</li>
    <li>Dysfunctional muscle performance due to excess stretch and weakness in the musculature on the convex side [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018]</li>
    <li>If one hip is adducted, the ipsilateral adductors are strong and have decreased flexibility and the ipsilateral abductors will be lengthened and weak [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018]</li>
    <li>If on hip is adducted, the contralateral side will have lengthened and weak adductors and short and tight abductors [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018].</li>
    <li>As scoliosis progresses, <i>rib expansion</i> decreases, resulting in cardiopulmonary impairments and difficulty with breathing [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018]</li>
</ul>

 

## Potential Sources of Symptoms  

<ul>
    <li>Muscle fatigue on convex side</li>
    <li>Ligamentous strain on convex side</li>
    <li>Nerve root irritation on concave side [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018] due to closing of intervertebral foramen</li>
    <li>Joint irritation on concave side due to joint closing [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018]</li>
</ul>

## Common Causes

Causes of <i>structural scoliosis</i>:
<ul>
    <li>Neuromuscular disorders (CP, SCI, progressive neurological diseases, progressive muscular diseases)</li>
    <li>Osteopathic disorders (e.g. hemivertebra, osteomalacia, Rickets, Fractures) [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018]</li>
    <li>Idiopathic</li>
</ul>

Causes of <i>Nonstructural Scoliosis</i>:

<ul>
    <li>Structural or Fucntional Leg Length Discrepancy [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018]<li>
    <li>Muscle guarding or spasm from back or neck pain [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018]</li>
    <li>Habitual or Asymmetrical postures [@kisnerTherapeuticExerciseFoundations2018]</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

# Rehab Goals

- **Facilitate correct postural alignment**: Use asymmetrical postural habits to prevent further development
- **Facilitate and maintain respiration**: chest mobility @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
-  Improve spine mobility
- Reduce back pain: improve spine mobility and quality of movement @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 
- Functional training of pre-bracing skills
- **Maintain muscle strength**: Especially in the lengthened/weakened abdominals @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- **Regain length/strength balance muscle relationships**: in spine and extremities @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

## Length-Strength Relationship

::: {.callout}
As a general rule, it is best to **strengthen convex muscles** and to **stretch concave muscles** @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
:::

# Therex {#therex}

Asymmetrical exercises should be used to alter the body's alignment and return to symmetry @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.

## Example

- Example: R thoracic curve, L lumbar curve
    - Thoracic spine has convexity towards the *right*
        - Thoracic rotation *towards* convexity (right)
    - Lumbar spine has convexity towards the *left*
        - Lumbar rotation *towards* convexity (left)
    - Expected findings: @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
        - Weak R Iliopsoas
        - Weak R external oblique
    - Asymmetrical exercises
        - Weak R external oblique treated with **left ue diagonal reach** resulting in R thoracic sidebend @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
        - **Resisted Seated R hip flexion** to strengthen R iliopsoas @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
    - Functional exercises
        - *Superman with convex sidebend* where the patient is prone with arms overhead while deviating thorax *away* from concave side @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
        - Supine + convex overhead abduction reach + concave arm extension/adduction to facilitate sidebend towards convexity
        - Child's pose + sidebend towards convex side @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
        - Sidebending off edge of treatment table @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
        - Sidebending over stability ball towards convexity @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020



# Schroth Method {#schroth-method}


# Plan of Care

## Phase 1: Position and gravity assisted

<il>
    <li>Sidelying on the convex side over a pillow to facilitate sidebending <i>towards</i> the convex side</li>
    <li>While in the sidelying position, perform lateral costal breathing to improve diaphragmatic breathing and rib expansion on the <i>concave</i> side</li>
    <li></li>
</il>

## Phase 2: AROM

Asymmetrical thoracic rotation
Asymmetrical scapulothoracic retraction/protraction

You will want to work on ipsilateral rotation and scapular retraction on the <bold>concave side</bold>

<ul>
    <li>Horizontal cable pull through on concave side</li>
</ul>


Ipsilateral scapular protraction combined with contralateral trunk rotation on the <bold>convex side</bold> to return to realignment 

<ul>
    <li>Cable punch on convex side</li>
</ul>


## Phase 3:
