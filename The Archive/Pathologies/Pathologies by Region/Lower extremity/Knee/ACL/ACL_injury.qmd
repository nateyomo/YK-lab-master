## Kyrie Irving 2024-2025 Season

{{< video https://youtu.be/QjfMofu4Pm8 >}}

During the 2024-2025 NBA season, Kyrie Irving is hyperextending his left knee as he approached the basket.

He was later diagnosed with an ACL tear.

This would be considered a *contact* ACL injury since he was impacted at his R abdomen and R leg which caused him to land improperly.
