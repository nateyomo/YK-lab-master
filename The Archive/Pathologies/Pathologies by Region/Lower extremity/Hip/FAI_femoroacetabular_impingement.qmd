Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) refers to an abnormal articulation and grinding of the femoral head against the acetabulum @reimanDiagnosticAccuracyClinical2015.

FAI is believed to contribute to acetabular labral tear (ALT) and/or chondrolabral injury @reimanDiagnosticAccuracyClinical2015.


# Examination

## Palpation

Palpation is generally unrevealing for patients with FAI but should be used to rule out other causes of pain including those from the spine, lateral hip, and pubic symphysis @wongPhysicalExaminationHip2022.

- TTP over Hip flexors can be indicative of hip flexor injury, irritation, or tendonitis as a cause of groin pain @wongPhysicalExaminationHip2022.
    - Intra-articular causes of groin pain are typically not palpable @wongPhysicalExaminationHip2022
