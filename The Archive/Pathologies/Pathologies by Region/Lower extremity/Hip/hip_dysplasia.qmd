[**Hip Dysplasia**]({{< var ref-hip-dysplasia.path >}}): [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]


## Presentation

Often patients compensate for insufficient passive stability by maintianing a position of anterior pelvic tilt to maximize femoral head coverage [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

- Look for associated Iliopsoas and rectus femoris muscle tightness [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]

## Treatment


Hip dysplasia is an unstable hip with overly-lax or weakened capsuloligamentous structures [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

As a result, treatment should involve a similar approach to hip instability.
