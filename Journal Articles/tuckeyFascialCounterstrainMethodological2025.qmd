# Osteopathic manipulation descriptions

Active vs passive


## Direct vs indirect

Direct manipulation: resolve somatic dysfunction by identifying a restriction and applying a compressive force against the restriction until the barrier breaks free

Indirect manipulation: resolve somatic dysfunction by identifying a restriction and applying a slackening or decompressive force to the tissue or related tissues in order to improve circulation and reduce interstitial inflammation in order to stop the process creating the barrier.


# Tenderpoints

TART: 

- T: Tissue texture abnormalities
- A: Asymmetry
- R: Restricted ROM
- T: Tenderness
