# Syndrome v. Disease


Do you know the difference?



## Conceptual Frameworks

**Diseases** and **syndromes** are concepts whose only purpose is to framework, organize, and explain the complexity of a clinical experience @pearceDiseaseDiagnosisSyndrome2011


## Well-Defined Language Improves treatment

Using specific and intentional language, allows a clinician to create a more accurate prognosis and more effective treatment @pearceDiseaseDiagnosisSyndrome2011


<!-- 
- Improve transfer from literature to patient
- Help your own understanding of what to do next
- Help the next clinician know what to do next 
-->

## Poorly defined language

If we cannot clearly define these concepts, our attempts to communicate important patient information will only add more ambiguity and uncertainty into the patient's plan of care.

## So... What does a disease or syndrome refer to?

Is it a certain Etiology? Pathogenesis? Clinical presentation? or All of the above?

# Syndrome

A **state** of deterioration

<!-- *syn-* (together) and *-dromus* (a course) -->

## Syndrome: Literal meaning

Greek *syn-* (together) and *-dromus* (a course) can be taken literally as "running together" or "concurrence" 

---

We can apply this to a ***medical* syndrome** and define it as certain *signs and symptoms* that *run together* as a **clinical presentation**

---

## Definition

**Syndrome**: A *recognizable* group of signs and symptoms which indicate a *specific* condition for which a direct cause is **not** understood @calvoDiagnosesSyndromesDiseases2003

# Disease

A **process** of deterioration @lenkaWeBelittleEssential2020


---

<!-- 
## Disease: Context


We can use context to help define what is a **disease**:

Where there is a **disease** there is also a **disease process**.



-->


A **process** by definition needs a **start**, **middle**, and **end**

|Start|Middle|End|
|-|-|-|
|Etiology|Pathogenesis|Signs & Symptoms|


---

## Definition

**Disease**: A process of deterioration that has a specific *etiology*, *pathogenesis*, and *signs & symptoms* @lenkaWeBelittleEssential2020


<!-- These can be broken down into needs an **etiology**, **pathophysiology**, and **Signs & Symptoms** @lenkaWeBelittleEssential2020. -->

||Etiology|Pathogenesis|Signs & Symptoms|
|-|-|-|-|
|**Syndrome**|Unknown|Unknown|&check;|
|**Disease**|&check;|&check;|&check;|

## Treatment

Since a **syndrome** outlines a clinical presentation *without* a mechanism, its treatment plan focuses on **managing signs and symptoms** @lenkaWeBelittleEssential2020

</br>

A **disease** specifies the mechanism of disorder, the treatment can effect the **underlying mechanism** @lenkaWeBelittleEssential2020

## Example: Viral Syndrome

Physicians use "viral **syndrome**" when they are **uncertain** which specific viral agent is causing the illness @calvoDiagnosesSyndromesDiseases2003

</br>

Once the specific viral agent is identifed, it should be labeled as "_____ **disease**" @calvoDiagnosesSyndromesDiseases2003

## Example: Kawasaki Syndrome &rarr; Disease


When there was **limited knowledge** about Kawasaki Disease, the clinical signs and symptoms were referred to as "Kawasaki **Syndrome**" @calvoDiagnosesSyndromesDiseases2003.

</br>

As understanding progressed and its *etiology*, *pathogenesis*, and *clinical presentation* were clearly defined, it was then upgraded to "Kawasaki **Disease**" @calvoDiagnosesSyndromesDiseases2003
