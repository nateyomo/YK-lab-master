## When you should pursue alternative options

- physical tissue limitations (PROM &asymp; AROM)
- Patients with neuromuscular tissue limitations

For patients with PROM &gt; AROM, this is indicative of a neuromuscular ROM limitation.
This patient *could* benefit from stretching, but there are other treatments which could work better and with less compression


## Physical VS Neuromuscular Muscle Tightness


Physical:

- PROM &asymp; AROM
- **Passive muscle tension**: physical resistance to stretch from the structures of the muscle or surrounding fascia [@pageCurrentConceptsMuscle2012]

Neuromuscular:

- PROM &gt; AROM
- **Active muscle tension**: Tension created from dynamic muscle contration due to neuromuscular excitation [@pageCurrentConceptsMuscle2012]

## Physical Stretching Exercises

- Wall ITB stretch
- Thomas Stretch

## TFL Neuromuscular Releases

- Contract-relax
- Manual release
- Self-myofascial release
- Massage gun with stretching
