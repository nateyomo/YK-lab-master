# Piriformis Syndrome

A clear definition

---

Piriformis syndrome is one of the first pathologies we learn in Physical Therapy school.

It is easy to glance at the phrase and assume I knew what it was.

As I prepared my presentation on *Current concepts on the Hip* I realized my understanding of piriformis syndrome was not as clear as I had first thought.


## Questions we need to answer

- What is a syndrome?
- Is sciatica a requisite symptom?
- Presentation
