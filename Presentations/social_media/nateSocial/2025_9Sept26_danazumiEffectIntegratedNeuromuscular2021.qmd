<!-- # *Positonial Release Technique* VS *Integrated Neuromuscular Inhibition Technique* -->

# What Manual Therapy technique is best for Sciatica?

Can the traditional PRT treatment beat the new maximalist approach of INIT?

<!-- Can this jack-of-all-trades technique outperform the traditional PRT technique? -->

Danazumi et al set out to find an answer in 2021

Is ***positional release technique*** or ***integrated neuromuscular inhibition technique*** better for improving pain, symptoms, and quality of life for patients with ***Piriformis Syndrome***?

## Piriformis Syndrome

[**Piriformis Syndrome**]():{{< var ref-piriformis-syndrome.definition >}}

Piriformis Syndrome can result in sciatica by directly compressing the sciatic nerve

## Positional Release Technique

**Positional Release Technique (PRT)**: An osteopathic manipulation where trigger points are identified, compressed to ischemia until pain is produced, the muscle is slackened, which deactivates the trigger point

## Integrated Neuromuscular Inhibition Technique



Integrated Neuromuscular Inhibition Technique (INIT) uses a maximalist approach by attempting to combine the *muscle energy technique* and the *PRT* to reap the benefits of both.



**Integrated Neuromuscular Inhibition Technique (INIT)**: 

- Neuromuscular technique for deactivating trigger points in muscles involving ischemic compression of a trigger point, while bringing the muscle into a slackened positioned, followed by an isometrically enhanced stretch @chaitowModernNeuromuscularTechniques2003

INIT has a three pronged approach: 

1. Inhibition/ischaemic compression
1. Positional release
1. Isometrically enhanced stretch

- inhibitory (ischaemic) compression until a change is reported or noted
- placing of the tissues into a position of ease, to encourage a muscle spindle release of excessive tone (see descriptions of 'positional release' below)
- introduction by the patient of an isometric contraction of the precise tissues housing the trigger point 
- passive stretching of the local tissues active and passive stretching of the entire muscle (subsequent to another isometric contraction) (see notes on muscle energy technique (MET) below)
- activation of antagonists to muscle housing the trigger point may be used to complete the sequence.


## PRT vs INIT: Treatment Approach

|PRT|INIT|
|-|-|
|Ischemic compression|Ischemic compression|
|Slacken muscle|Slacken Muscle|

## Piriformis Technique


|PRT|INIT|
|-|-|
|60-90&deg; hip flexion and abduction|60-90&deg; hip flexion and abduction|
| Light trigger point compression|20-60s trigger point compression|
|Wait until pain subsides|Wait until pain subsides|
||Actively move *away* from restriction barrier with 20% strength to create isometric contraction 7-10s|
||Rapid pulsating contractions 20x in 10s|

## Dosage

|3 reps | 3 reps|
|10min|10min|

## Sampling

Danazumi took 48 adults from Nguru, Nigeria

- Mostly between 18-35
- Male > Female
- 

### Eligibility




## Methods

- Single blind
- RCT
- 2 sessions/week for 8 weeks


## Treatment

- 2x/wk for 8 weeks
- 2 physiotherapists
    - PT#1 6 years of experience
    - PT#2 10 years of experience
- PTs switch after 4 weeks
- Patients received stretching exercises at the clinic and given an HEP to take home

- Piriformis muscle trigger point: Piriformis muscle belly (halfway between inferior lateral angle of sacrum and greater trochanter)
- 3 repetition of treatment over 10min






## Stretching

The stretching exercises consisted of 3 repetitions of each exercise for 5 minutes at the end of each clinical visit.

The exercises were provided as an HEP for prescribed at 2x/wk.

Piriformis, hamstring, and calf stretching.

## Demographics 

- n=48
- age: 25-47

- Between-group: p&gt;0.05

## Results

Repeated measures ANOVA

- Time-effect for *all* outcomes: Significant (p&lt;0.001)
  - In short: everyone improved

But what is **better**, PRT or INIT?

- Between group Time and Intervention effects via *Bonferroni post hoc analyses*:
  - Post treatment
  - 4mo follow-up



## Limitations

- No control group
  - Did stretching have an impact?
