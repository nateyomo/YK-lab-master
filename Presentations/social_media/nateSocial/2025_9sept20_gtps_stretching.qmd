# Should patients with lateral hip pain stretch?

An equation to help your clinical decision making

---

## What is GTPS?

[**Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome**]({{< var ref-greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome.path >}}): A presentation of symptoms characterized by lateral hip pain around the *greater trochanter of the femur*.

</br>

**In short**: Pain on the side of the hip

<!-- To understand whether or not we should stretch, we must understand the pathophysiology of *GTPS* -->


## What causes the pain?

This hip pain is caused by *irritation* and *degeneration* of the tissues near the greater trochanter.
These tissues include gluteal tendons and/or trochanteric bursa.


## What causes the degeneration?

These tissues are irritated when the Tensor fascia latae (TFL) muscle and Iliotibial band (ITB) complex undergo tension resulting in compression of the underlying tissues against the greater trochanter.

## Simplified Rehab Process

1. Decrease TFL-ITB tension
1. Less compression of gluteal tendons & bursa
1. Less degeneration
1. Less pain
1. Happy patients

## Why Stretching is common

Many clinicians *assume* that prescribing stretches will result in decreased TFL-ITB tension and overall less degeneration and pain.

This is only *half*-true, this perspective overlooks the potential harms of stretching.

## Stretching does have benefits

After a stretch, the improved muscle extensibility and joint ROM can result in:

<!-- - less ITB tension, less tissue compression, less degeneration, and less pain. -->

- Less ITB tension
- Less tissue compression
- Less degeneration
- Less pain

## The Drawbacks of Stretching

<!-- During the stretch: tension on the TFL-ITB <i>increases</i> and can cause more compression &rarr; degeneration &rarr;and pain! -->
During the stretch, tension on the TFL-ITB <i>increases</i> and can cause: 

- More compression &rarr;
- More degeneration &rarr;
- More pain


## So... Should You stretch the ITB?

Deciding whether to stretch TFL-ITB will come down to a simple calculation:

Choose the option that results in the **least net compression**

---

## Calculating net compression

The long term *decreases* in compression from stretching **must** outweigh the short term *increases* in compression during the stretch exercise.



<!-- **Costs**: Increased compressive load on the symptomatic tissues, increasing degeneration and irritation
**Benefits**: Long term decreases in compressive load on the tissues and improved biomechanics of functional activities -->


## Know what to look for

In the clinic, look for a *direct* relationship where a limited TFL-ITB complex results in dysfunctional movement patterns.

## Gather data

Perform a *movement analysis* and look for limitations in hip extension and adduction during:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Sitting
- Standing
- Walking
:::

::: {.column}
- Lifting
- Running
- Jumping
:::
:::

## Treat Accordingly

Patients who can perform these activities correctly without experiencing TFL-ITB tightness are **less** likely to benefit from stretching.
<!-- Patients who do not display TFL-ITB limitations during movement are *less* likely to benefit from stretching. -->
<!-- Continue to explore other avenues to deficits, such as lumbopelvic stabilization. -->

Patients who experience TFL-ITB tightness and exhibit movement compensations would benefit most from stretching the TFL-ITB complex.





<!-- ## Dosage

Even when stretching is indicated, it should still be prescribed only to patients who are asymptomatic during and after stretching [@pageCurrentConceptsMuscle2012]. -->
