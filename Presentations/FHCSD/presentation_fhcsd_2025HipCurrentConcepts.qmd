### Guarded Deep hip Stabilizers

- Femoral head will be pushed forward and be passively resting on hip flexor tendons anteriorly

The long muscles will attempt to perform the job of stabilization.
Long muscles such as sartorius, TFL, rectus femoris, hip flexors, and hamtrings.
I think of this similar to dysfunctional <i>deep neck flexors</i> that result in overactive scalenes, upper trapezius, and levator scapulae.


# Biomechanics

# Function

# Red Flags

"Medical concerns related to traumatic onset injuries include but are not limited to fractures, dislocations, tendon avulsions, and lower abdominal organ injury. Traumatic injuries that are accompanied by inability to bear weight, intolerance to joint movement, obvious disfigurement, extreme swelling, non-musculoskeletal symptoms, or extreme patient apprehension should be considered indicators for medical referral before initiating physical therapy intervention and even potentially before performing a comprehensive examination" [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

# Pharmeceutical considerations

## PathoMechanism

GTPS is theorized to be an overuse injury due to chronic movement dysfunction of **Hip Adduction** and **IR** [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

Poor eccentric control when loading into a hip

An attempt to create stability by sitting into passive structures such as IT band and glute tendons

## Testing

Four clinical signs and symptoms were identified as the most common findings and can be present with or without sciatica: 

- Buttock pain
- Pain with sitting
- Tenderness near greater sciatic notch
- Pain with maneuvers that cause tension of the piriformis

- Seated piriformis test

# Ischiofemoral impingement

# CONDITIONS-SPECFIC EVIDENCE-BASED REHABILITATION CONCEPTS

# FAI treatment

available body of literature is relatively small and of lower quality when compared to hip OA
Clinical expertise and experience is even more valuable with this population.

--- 

"Patients that do not achieve satisfactory results from a structured course of rehabilitation may be candidates for surgical intervention. Typically, arthroscopic procedures are performed, or less commonly open procedures, to remove excessive bone from the femoral head-neck junction or acetabular rim and treatment of any associated joint injury such as labral tears"



## Education and activity modification


- Decrease aggravating activities to allow the patient to move out of the inflammatory stage of healing
- Pair this with education
    - How long to limit activity
    - Why
"Consider a temporary recommendation of strengthening in “protected” ranges by decreasing squat or lunge depth along with decreasing the amount of forward flexion that occurs with exercises such as the single leg Romanian deadlift"

::: {.callout-note}
A suggested length of time for activity modifications is not established and would be expected to vary by severity of presentation and patient goals
:::

## Body Structure & Function



Addressing hip flexor muscle length issues should be prioritized as tightness of these structures can have a postural effect by increasing anterior pelvic tilt.

## Functional training

- Single-Leg Positions and Movements


## Return to Play

There is not an established RTP criteria for this population.

- stepdown
- single leg squat
- SEBT

# Hip microinstability

[**Hip Microinstability**]({{< var ref-hip-microinstability.path >}}): Symptoms related to Hypermobility of the hip joint[@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]


# Hip Dysplasia


[**Hip Dysplasia**]({{< var ref-hip-dysplasia.path >}}): [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]


## Presentation

Often patients compensate for insufficient passive stability by maintianing a position of anterior pelvic tilt to maximize femoral head coverage [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

- Look for associated Iliopsoas and rectus femoris muscle tightness [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]

## Treatment


Hip dysplasia is an unstable hip with overly-lax or weakened capsuloligamentous structures [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].

As a result, treatment should involve a similar approach to hip instability.

---

- Protect structures from instability events
- Address impairments
- Optimize function 
- Prevention of OA

## Aerobic Exercise

Aerobic exercise 


5590% maximal heart rate 3-5 days per week for 20-90 minutes in the hip OA population

### Minimize impact during aerobic exercise

- Cycling
- Elliptical machine
- Swimming
- Running
- Tai-Chi
- Yoga

## Activity Modification

Reduce joint irritability
- Avoid prolonged end-range positions
    - Particularly hip internal and external rotation
- Avoiding sitting with legs crossed or in excessive flexion

# Femoral Neck Stress Fracture

[**Femoral Neck Stress Fracture**](): {{< var ref-femoral-neck-stress-fracture.definition >}}

## Caution

- Immediate weight bearing restriction to prevent further fracture progression or compromised bony stability
- 6-8 weeks and up to 14weeks for complex patients with poorer prognosis

## Prognosis

- Uncomplicated
- Complicated

- Compression Sided
- Tension sided

---

### Poor Prognosis 

- Tension-sided
- age?
- &gt;50% width of femoral nec

## Weeks 0-8

- NWB 
- OKC exercises to strengthen

::: {.callout-tip title="Refer to Aquatic PT"}
Aquatic exercises can be used to achieve a therapeutic exercise volume while not jeopardizing healing osseous tissue
:::

## RTS

Uncomplicated compression side FNSFs and pubic rami stress fractures that are managed nonoperatively can typically return to running and athletic activity around 12 weeks after diagnosis

However, return-to-sport timeframes of up to 28 weeks have been reported for complicated, and slow-healing cases 

## Rehab

- *Gradual* PT supervised return-to-running [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]
- Glute Medius strengthening
- Frontal Plane pelvic stabilization
- Pelvic stability during loading

## Tension-sided FNFS {#tension-sided-fnfs}

Tension-sided patients have higher risk for displacement with weight bearing [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024].
As a result, surgery with a percutaneous screw fixation is the recommended course of treatment


## Surgical Management

- Tension-sided FNFS
- Patients with compression sided FNSFs that are greater than 50% of the width of the femoral neck are also considered candidates
- If a fracture becomes displaced, surgery should be performed to mitigate the potential for adverse effects including postoperative AVN and fixation failure

### Rehab

**Week 0-6**

- NWB [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]

**Week 7-12**

- PWB [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]

**3-6mo**

- Return-to-sport can be achieved around 3-6 months after surgery but, can take up to a year in complicated cases with delayed healing [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]

# Extra-Articular Conditions


# Iliopsoas Complex Injuries

## Activity modification

- Minimize aggravating mechanical and pain symptoms
    - i.e. Repetitive hip flexion and extension

This can lead to substantial activity modifications for athletic populations

---

## Successful activity modification

You must provide alternatives to the activities for the patient to maximize healing and minimize atrophy

- Cardio: Cycling, ellipitcal, or aquatic exercise
- Resistance training:

## ROM

Stretching, STM, trigger point release, and dry needling were all recommended to improve ROM deficits [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]

No time restrictions were given based on acuity of injury.

## Strengthening

- Gradually progress strengthening
- Since the [psoas major]({{< var ref-psoas-major.origin >}}) and [minor]({{< var ref-psoas-minor.origin >}}) originate from the thoracolumbar junction, it is important to monitor lumbopelvic stability during exercises
- Lumbopelvic strengthening and stabilization exercises are important to start early to create a stable foundation for the iliopsoas complex before exercising it
    - supine lumbopelvic stabilization &rarr; CKC lumbopelvic stabilization
- marching in supine &rarr; Seated &rarr; Standing [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]
- Apta recommended resisted hip flexion from 20&deg; extension to 45&deg; flexion 
- Loaded hip flexion with ankle weights, bands, and cables 
    - Standing hip marches have changing torque on the hip, with the most torque at 90&deg; hip flexion
    - Supine SLR exercise will have increased torque at 0&deg; hip flexion with decreasing load as you approach 90&deg;

## RTS

- ballistic speed exercises [@aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024]

Criteria

- Symptoms still reproducible
- substantial strength asymmetries

## Unresponsive to PT

- US guided corticosteroids @aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024
- Endoscopic tendon release @aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024
- Lengthening procedures @aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024

## Acute / Protective phase


- gentle ROM at hips and knees @aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024
- Lumbopelvic stabilization @aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024
- Isometric activation of adjacent / unaffected muscles

Criteria

- Tolerance of therex
- Low-level ADLs
- Symptom stability


---

::: {.callout-tip}

Since patients are very irritable and limited acutely, they should be re-evaluated as their pain/functional tolerance increases to screen out coexisting conditions @aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024
:::

## Subacute phase

Impairment based rehab

- Flexibility exercises should only be employed when there is symptom stability thyroughout the available ROM
    - limited evidence for mm flexibility in prevention

## Prevention

- Adductor:Abductor Strength ratio: &gt;80% @aptaCurrentConceptsOrthopaedic2024
    - Pro hockey had 17x increase risk of adductor mm injury if &lt;80%

## Strengthening

Isometric &rarr; Concentric &rarr; Eccentric

H-test

"The H-test has been described as a test to assess return-to-sport-readiness for patients with hamstring muscles injuries.146 Due to the ballistic nature of the test, it should not be used until the patient is asymptomatic and demonstrates normal and symmetrical hamstring muscle strength and flexibility. The test is performed by securing the patient in the supine position with their affected side knee locked in extension (typically by a brace).
