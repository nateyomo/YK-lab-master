# Muscle Tone

[**Tone**]({{< var ref-muscle-tone.path >}}): refers to a relaxed muscle's resistance to passive stretch/tension

The muscle resists the stretch through both *active* and *passive* mechanisms

## Passive component

The passive mechanisms refer to viscoelastic structures that are non-contractile.

<ul>
    <li>Actin & Myosin</li>
    <li>Connective tissue</li>
    <li>etc</li>
</ul>

::: {.callout-note}
Forces created through passive mechanisms are **invisible** to EMGs
:::


## Active component

The active mechanisms refer to contractile motor units

These are controlled by spinal and supraspinal mechanisms

::: {.callout-note}
Forces created through active mechanisms *can* be measured by EMGs
:::



# Anatomy

[**Muscle spindle**]({{< var ref-muscle-spindle.path >}}): Intrafusal fibers

[**Muscle belly**]({{< var ref-muscle-belly.path >}}): Extrafusal fibers

[**Tendon**]({{< var ref-tendon.path >}}): Connective tissue connecting muscle to bone

---



## Intrafusal Fibers

[Intrafusal Fibers]({{< var ref-skeletal-muscle.intrafusal-fibers >}})

- “Muscle spindle”
- Sensory organs 
- Detects changes in Length AND Velocity

## Intrafusal fibers

<!-- Two types: Nuclear bag fibers and Nuclear chain fibers  -->

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
[**Nuclear bag fibers**](): 

- Length + velocity
- Ia Afferents &rarr; SC

:::
::: {.column}
[**Nuclear chain fibers**](): 

- Length
- Ia and II Afferents &rarr; SC
:::
:::



## Extrafusal Fibers
[Extrafusal Fibers]({{< var ref-skeletal-muscle.extrafusal-fibers >}})


- “Muscle belly”
- Contraction creates force and movement

## Tendon

- Connects muscle to bone








Both Synapse onto &gamma;-motor neurons in Spinal Cord

<!-- 
Two types of nuclear bag fibers &rarr; static for mm length and dynamic for velocity 
Healthy example:
Static - like finding end range stretch 
Dynamic - like DTR 


Sensory feedback to spinal cord via: 
Intrafusal fibers/muscle spindle: sensory organs that detect changes in muscle length+velocity. 
Two types: 
Nuclear bag fibers- detects length+velocity
Activates Type Ia sensory fibers to SC
Nuclear chain fibers: length
Activates Type Ia and Type II sensory fibers to SC
Contractile component of muscle:
Extrafusal fibers: contracts to generate muscle force 

Intrafusal fibers are contractile on either end and sensory in the middle!!! 


Nuclear bag fibers named bc nuceli in middle
Nuclear chain : nuclei lined up in line 

Intrafusal fibers detect muscle length and via afferents send info about it static/dynamic back to SC
GTOs look at tendon tension &rarr; sent info back to SC




 -->




## Extrafusal fibers

- Contracts muscle itself
- Activated by Alpha Motor Neurons from SC


# Stretch Reflexes

[**Stretch Reflex**](): {{< var ref-stretch-reflex.definition >}}

Muscle spindles generate tone via the stretch reflex (dynamic or static):

## 2 types

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
[**Dynamic**]({{< var ref-dynamic-stretch-reflex.path >}}): sudden rapid stretch of a muscle &rarr; Ia &rarr; SC &rarr; alpha motor neuron causes sudden contraction of muscle 
:::
::: {.column}
[**Static**]({{< var ref-static-stretch-reflex.path >}}): Sustained stretch &rarr; type II &rarr; spinal cord &rarr; alpha motor efferents &rarr; cause asynchronous contraction of muscle fibers (motor units not all discharging together) = mild sustained contraction of these fibers as long as it is stretched. 
:::
:::




This is the physiological basis of maintaining muscle tone


<!-- What are gamma?

Muscle spindles &rarr;sensory receptors 

Muscle spindles, on the other hand, are the sensory receptors that house the intrafusal fibers. They are encapsulated structures embedded within the skeletal muscle and contain several intrafusal fibers. Muscle spindles function as mechanoreceptors that provide the central nervous system with information about muscle length and the rate of change in length, which is crucial for proprioception and the regulation of muscle tone and reflexes. (open evidence)


On the other hand, there is a threshold, when the stronger a muscle is stretched, stronger is the reflex contraction. After crossing the threshold, contraction stops, and the muscle relaxes. This is known as ‘inverse stretch reflex’ and is mediated by the Golgi tendon organ present in the fascicles of a tendon [1 (same review)



Dynamic is like deep tendon reflex 
 -->


## Mechanism


Muscle Stretches &rarr; Sensory info send to spinal cord &rarr; Muscle contracts to prevent overstretch damage



<ol>
    <li>Muscle stretches</li>
    <li>Intrafusal fibers sense stretch</li>
    <li>Ia + II afferents send signals to SC</li>
    <li>Synapses onto agonist Alpha motor efferents</li>
    <li>Agonist muscle contracts</li>
</ol>

# Reciprocal Inhibition

[**Reciprocal Inhibition**]({{< var ref-reciprocal-inhibition.path >}}): {{< var ref-reciprocal-inhibition.definition >}}

---

Within spinal cord, Ia & II afferents also synapse onto:

<ol>
    <li>Inhibitory Interneurons of alpha motor neurons</li>
    <li>Inhibits alpha motor neurons of antagonist muscles while agonist contracts </li>
</ol>


**Result**: Antagonist muscle cannot contract preventing further stretch of the agonist


# How Do They work during muscle stretch

# Recurrent inhibition

[**Recurrent inhibition**]({{< var ref-recurrent-inhibition.path >}}): {{< var ref-recurrent-inhibition.definition >}}

---

<ul>
    <li>Motor neuron fires &rarr; activates inhibitory interneuron</li>
    <li>Inhibits the same neuron or a group of neurons.</li>
    <li>Mediated by Renshaw cells in spinal cord</li>
</ul>

This feedback loop helps regulate motor neuron activity, preventing excessive firing and contributing to the fine-tuning of motor control.

# Alpha-Gamma (&alpha;-&gamma;) Coactivation

[**Alpha-Gamma (&alpha;-&gamma;) Coactivation**](): {{< var ref-alpha-gamma-coactivation.definition >}}

---


Body needs to maintain stretch sensation when a muscle is contracting:

1. Muscle contraction
2. Extrafusal fibers **and** intrafusal fibers contract
3. Muscle spindle tension is maintained due to the intrafusal fiber contraction
4. Maintains the firing rate of type Ia fibers in an optimal range for detecting a change in muscle length

---

::: {.callout-tip}
HYPOTHETICALLY if ONLY alpha-motor efferents are excited and Extrafusal fibers contract &rarr; reduces tension on muscle spindle &rarr; desensitization &rarr; decreased stretch proprioception info


HOWEVER this is not exactly what happens because the body needs to have stretch sensation during contraction/shortening!
:::


## Summary {.smaller}


- Muscle stretches
- Intrafusal fibers sense stretch
- Ia + II afferents send signals to SC
    - Synapses onto agonist &alpha;-motor efferents 
    - Synapses onto inhibitory interneurons
    - Synapse on Agonist gamma-motor efferent
        - Stimulates agonist intrafusal fiber contraction &rarr; tensioning muscle spindle to maintain stretch sensitization
    - Synapse on Inhibitory Interneuron of antagonist gamma-motor efferent
        - Inhibits gamma motor neuron to antagonist muscle, decreasing tension on antagonist muscle spindle (desensitized to stretch)


## Intrafusal and Extrafusal fibers' role in proprioception

To provide proprioception, the intrafusal fibers must contract and stretch in parallel with the extrafusal fibers
MM Stretch &rarr; both intrafusal and extrafusal are stretched &rarr; type Ia/II &rarr; sensitive to stretch
During a stretch, the stretch on the intrafusal fibers provide proprioceptive information of a muscle stretch
MM Contraction &rarr; you would expect extrafusal contraction and intrafusal fibers to not contract 
However, not exactly the case;alpha gamma co-activation 
Alpha and gamma motor neurons contract in parallel in order to maintain tension on the intrafusal sensory fibers to provide proprioception during contraction 


<!-- You would expect extrafusal contraction and intrafusal to not contract bc muscle isnt being lengthened  right and is only snes to length
Bc your body still wants to be sensitive/aware to changes in muscle length, even when contracting a muscle ! 

GTOs are this….

Intrafusal sensory fibers become slack, less sensitive to stretch &rarr; Dec type Ia/II activation
How do we combat this &rarr; extrafusal fibers and intrafusal fibers contract at same time 
Both alpha and gamma motor neurons contract 
Not slack anymore &rarr; will be able to 
Can become slack w/ too much contraction since not activated (only activated during stretches) (dec AP)

 -->



# GTOS: Prevents tendon avulsion

Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) are sensory organs found within tendons


These organs detect tendon stretch and send sensory signals via *Type 1b afferents* &rarr; spinal cord.

## GTO Example: Ego bicep curling


Muscle contraction &rarr; tendon lengthens &rarr; GTOs are proprioceptive/sense length &rarr; type 1b afferents &rarr; SC &rarr; DRG &rarr; synapses onto 2 interneurons:

# Questions?

# Supraspinal influences

<!-- All past were spinal, now were going to get into how supaspinal/spinal tracts that originate in cerebrum influence….
 -->

# CST and RST tracts

Corticospinal Tract

- Cerebral cortex &rarr; crosses at pyramidal decussation &rarr; motor neurons
    - Inhibits lower motor neurons 
- Gives off corticoreticular pathway on way down &rarr; medullary reticulospinal nuclei &rarr; reticulospinal (RST) tract 
    - Inhibits lower motor neurons  

<!-- (Gamma + Alpha inhibition)

Can also excite motor neurons– important to show loss of inhibition leads to disinhibition (spasticity) 
 -->



::: {.callout}
see image on slide18
:::


# slide 19

- Supraspinal: facilitatory and inhibitory long tracts + cerebellum,BG, limbic system and more thought to modulate muscle tone…
- Inhibitory: All work to reduce excitability of motor neurons/dec muscle tone: 
- CST: inhibits spinal reflexes, helping with fine tuning of motor commands, suppressing excessive reflex activity. Crucial for voluntary motor control
- Dorsal RST: suppresses muscle tone, usually during REM sleep or motor control tasks
- Facilitatory: All work to increase excitability of motor neurons, increasing tone
- VST: tonic drive reflects motion and position of head and projects to extensor muscles, provides drive to facilitate antigravity support. Disruption leads to dec’d extensor tone/postural instability 
- Medial RST: excites motor neurons controlling axial/proximal limb muscles, supporting postural adjustments/locomotion

# Hypertonia/ Hyperreflexia in UMN Lesions

Where does it all go wrong?



# UMN Lesion &rarr; Hypertonia/Reflexia

Damage in Cerebrum: 

- Inhibition of medullary RST/CST &rarr; Disinhibition of motor neurons:
- Increase alpha motor excitation &rarr; inc in extrafusal fiber contraction &rarr; HYPERTONIA 
- Increase gamma motor excitation &rarr; inc in intrafusal fiber contraction &rarr; sensitized intrafusal fibers &rarr; reflex pathway activates &rarr; HYPERREFLEXIA 


# slide 22

MANY pathways are involved… medullary RST has a large effect on Hypertonia/Hyperreflexia

Studies show later on RST may take over more muscle mvmt to make up for dysfunctional CST in Spasticity (Sangari et al, 2019)


# Clonus

Pathological reduction in [Reciprocal inhibition](#reciprocal-inhibition) due to supraspinal lesions, leading to contract-relax cycles as muscles are stretched/contracted.

# Spasms

This heightened reflex activity can result in involuntary muscle spasms, which are sudden, often painful contractions of the muscle in response to stretch

# Why are only some muscles spastic?

<ul>
    <li>More Excitable To Begin With</li>
    <li>Biceps, PFs are more excitable/experience more spasticity because they are more used throughout our daily life</li>
    <li>Excitability amplified after injury</li>
</ul>


# Synergies + Spasticity

Why do we have them?

<ul>
    <li>Error compensation - if one muscle is weak, others help achieve motion</li>
    <li>Energy efficiency- CNS reduces complexity of mvmt by organizing muscles into synergies, allows for quick/automatic mvmts without higher level control</li>
    <li>UE: flexor synergy dominant</li>
    <li>LE: extensor synergy dominant</li>
</ul>

# Synergies

After UMN lesion 

<ul>
    <li>CST is damaged, body increases reliance on RST - less capable of fine motor, better at gross motor control - leading to synergistic mvmts</li>
    <li>RST Is disinhibited (excited), causing involuntary co contraction – ie trying to lift shoulder, elbow + wrist flex too</li>
</ul>
 



## MMTs are *not* indicated for Synergistic Muscles

Synergies make MMTs inaccurate 

Co-activation of other muscles makes it impossible to isolate 1 muscle

Not purely volitional movement, but rather more automatic driven (RST) 
[@Mooney2024]

<!-- Increased tone in a synergy dominant movement can feel strong, but it is truly abnormal resistance rather than true muscle force production

 Following severe corticospinal tract damage, upregulated reticulospinal tract activity may compensate for a loss of corticospinal tract input, providing some proximal recovery of isolated and within-synergy movements, but deficits in performing out of synergy movements and finger fractionation remain.

# Pathophysiology {.smaller}

Spasticity is mostly due to dis-inhibition of the medullary (dorsal) Reticulospinal tract

<ul>
    <li>Spasticity may be maintained through facilitatory influences of the medial (pontine) RST </li>
    <li>Vestibulospinal tract plays a minor role </li>
    <li>As shown by sectioning studies of the human spinal cord in those w/ spasticity</li>
    <li>Other brain regions may also be involved: BG, cerebellum, etc</li>
    <li>Studies are still examining all influences on spasticity/tone – a lot is still unknown…</li>
</ul>



## Spinal Influence/SCI spasticity

Spinal influence:

Many different ways to inc excitation or dec inhibition in spinal cord


Descending monoaminergic drive normally excites alpha motor neurons and inhibits dorsal horn/sensory input

---

### SCI Chronicity

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Acute stage of SCI: loss of monoaminergic influence &rarr; causes hypo excitability of motor neurons and excitation of sensory input 
:::
::: {.column}
Chronic SCI Spasticity &rarr;Product of overactive motor neurons 
Weeks after disconnection from supraspinal input, motor neurons transition into an excitable state, really responsive to excitatory NTs like glutamate. Leads to muscle contractions, easily triggered by touch/mm stretching. 
:::
:::

---


### SCI SEVERITY

#### Incomplete SCI
Incomplete/partial myelopathy involving lateral funiculus: If there is involvement of CST only, it will result in weakness, hypotonia and loss of superficial reflexes.
If there is additional involvement of dorsal RST, spasticity and hyperreflexia will develop due to unopposed activity of medial RST.
Spasticity will be predominant in antigravity muscles and will result in paraplegia in extension and extensor spasms.
Flexor spasms can occur if FRA are activated by pressure sores.


On the other hand, if there is involvement of dorsal RST only with sparing CST, there will be spasticity without much weakness.


#### Complete SCI

Complete myelopathy with involvement of all four tracts: Spasticity will be less in this case because of lack of facilitatory input from medial RST and VST.
Disinhibition of FRA will result in paraplegia in flexion and flexor spasms.


# Parkinsonian Rigidity

[**Rigidity**]({{< var ref-rigidity.path >}}): Increased resistance to passive movement, affecting both flexor and extensor muscles in Parkinson's disease

Neural mechanisms are incompletely understood 


## Types of Rigidity




[**Lead-pipe rigidity**](): a uniform, constant resistance throughout the range of motion, typically seen in conditions like Parkinson's disease.

[**Cogwheel rigidity**](): involves intermittent jerks during movement due to oscillations between the agonist and antagonist muscles.

---

| **Cogwheel** | **Leadpipe** |
|-|-|
|Rigidity + tremor|Smooth, consistent|
|Tonic increase in muscle tone [@wrightAxialHypertonicityParkinsons2007]|EMG studies show phasic bursts of muscle activity [@mearaRelationshipElectromyographicActivity1992]|

:::


## Pathomechanism

The direct pathway normally facilitates movement by disinhibiting (EXCITES) the motor cortex.

The indirect pathway inhibits movement:

<ul>
  <li>Becomes overactive (due to lack of dopamine) in PD</li>
  <li>Increases inhibition of the motor cortex</li>
  <li>Dec activation of CST/RST</li>
  <li>Causes inc activation of alpha motor neurons &rarr; Rigidity/bradykinesia.</li>
</ul>

## Rigidity

Rigidity is end-stage form of this neurophysiological process


<ol>
  <li>Basal ganglia increase inhibitory output</li>
  <li>Excessive &alpha;-motor neurons</li>
  <li>Sustained muscle contraction (Rigidity)</li>
</ol>

::: {.notes}

As the basal ganglia increase their inhibitory output, there is excessive excitation of the &alpha;-motor neurons resulting in sustained muscle contraction known as rigidity
:::

### Other potential mechanisms

  <li>Exaggeration of long-latency stretch reflexes (LLSR)</li>
  <li>Enhanced shortening reaction (SR) and stretch-induced inhibition (SII)</li>
  <li>Involvement of brainstem circuits involving sublaterodorsal nucleus, nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (NRGC), locus coeruleus, caudal raphe and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN)</li>
  <li>Alteration in functional connectivity in brain networks involving frontoparietal connection, premotor-pre-cuneus connection</li>

[**Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy**](): Irreversible surgery where a surgeon cuts sensory neurons in order to prevents stretch reflex/afferents from contributing spasticity 


<!-- "SUR-2: The AAPM&R TEP recommends utilization of selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) to treat spasticity with proper patient selection focused on patients with primarily spasticity of the lower extremity (LE),  adequate LE strength and selective motor control, and absence of significant contractures.
Technical Note: Historically, the procedure has primarily been performed in children; more recently SDR in adults has been noted to be helpful in reducing spasticity, maintaining or improving level of ambulation, but with a higher propensity to develop new sensory deficits or neuropathic pain." -->


---

<ul>
  <li>Primarily for children 4-10 years old or some adults with CP who are unresponsive to other treatments</li>
  <li>Diffuse Spasticity</li>
  <li>Decreases spasticity as far as 17 years after surgery</li>
  <li>After SDR, early intense PT is indicated to capitalize on opportunities to change motor patterning</li>
  <li>Monitor for Dysesthesias: Gabapentin given if experienced, usually lasts a couple of weeks</li>
</ul>

---

### Criteria

Usual Criteria:


- Prematurity,
- Diplegia CP, 
- GMFCS I-III,
- Age 4-10 y/o, 
- Pure spasticity
- Antigravity hip flexor strength, 
- Adequate cognition, 
- Absence of contractures, 
- Periventricular leukomalacia with no basal ganglia or thalamic lesions on imaging

Following surgery, changes in tone creates opportunities to change motor patterning. 
Initial intense PT rec:  Early aggressive OP PT 2x per week or 6 weeks of intensive inpatient PT 

---

### Other Considerations

- Dec spasticity as far as 17 years after surgery
- Deep tendon reflexes and clonus is absent after 
  - Absence of patellar reflex can lead to patients having an inc in falls from inadvertent knee flexion in stance bc of the absence of normal knee extension reflex when knee is suddenly flexed. Pts adapt over time to this change. 
- Safe procedure, long term complications rare - some side effects include dysesthesias, urinary retention, numbness, infections and cerebral spinal leak (<10% of patients)
- Dysesthesia risk inc with # rootlets dissected, usually lasts a couple weeks and responds to gabapentin. Nocturnal leg spasms can occur but respond to diazepam. 
- Following SDR, recommendations are for patients with knee flexion contractures to wear immobilizers at night thru adolescent growth spurt.


# Tendon Lengthening Surgery {#tendon-lengthening-surgery}

- Cutting part/all of tendon to lengthen it 
- Typically CP kids, sometimes DMD/SCI/Stroke
- All other options must be trialed prior

---

### Achilles tendon Lengthening

- Indicated with **severe contractures**
- Usually &ge;20&deg; of PF
- Cast 6-12 weeks, crutches 4-6 weeks
- Intensive PT after: Stretches, strengthening and non-articulating AFOs for walking is indicated @Galletti2024


::: {.callout-warning}
Over Lengthening &rarr;Worsens gait &rarr;Poor power in toe off/risk of crouching in midstance
:::

## Neurotomy {#neurotomy}

[**Neurotomy**](): Cutting peripheral motor nerve

Diminishing reflex arc &rarr; Reducing spasticity

---

Mainly for Focal spasticity 
MAS > 3 (passive mvmt difficult)
Indicated after botox is trialed/failed or is too costly 
80-85% success rate for dec spasticity

Procedure may induce paralysis or dec strength, but pt can recover strength via other motor nerves helping to compensate 


## Other Surgeries

Non selective ventral dorsal rhizotomy: children w GMFCS IV or V with sig hypertonia affecting comfort, care, positioning
- Both sensory and motor rootlets cut from L1-S2 in nonselective fashion (50-80%)
- By preserving a portion of the ventral rootlets, sufficient motor control preserved for some voluntary movements. 
- Reduction in spasticity/dystonia but some dystonia can return 1-2 years later
- However, can significantly weaken legs – reduce standing ability

::: {.callout-note}
Selective peripheral - 61-91 % pt satisfaction rate
:::


## Botox (A) {#botox}

INJ-1: The AAPM&R Spasticity TEP recommends clinicians consider use of botulinum toxin A for management of focal upper and lower limb spasticity.


---

- Distal muscles, focal relief 
- Inhibits release of Ach
- MAS scores improve
- Effects last 3-4 months
- Peak effect: 3-4 weeks post injection @chen2020



---

- May use AFOs/Orthoses post procedure 
- Can decrease pain d/t spasticity @wissel2016
- MS, stroke populations 
- Problems: expensive, not always covered by Insurance
- Adverse local effects: weakness, pain, leg cramps, skin rash, infection, 
- Adverse systemic effects can occur: dysphagia, dysphonia, weakness, dyspnea, respiratory distress

![Exemplar histology slides of muscles injected with Botulinum toxin type-A (BoNT-A). Control tissue that was injected with a corresponding volume of saline (Control), muscle receiving one BTXA injection evaluated 6 months following injection (1-BTX-A), muscle receiving two BTXA injections separated by 3 months and evaluated 6 months post the second injection (2-BTX-A), and muscle injected three times with BTXA, separated by 3 months and evaluated 6 months following the third and last injection. The red staining shows the contractile material of the muscle. The white, thin lines (especially visible in the Control slide) are representative of the collagen matrix structure, and the white extended areas (especially visible in the BoNT-A injected muscles) represent intramuscular fat.

### Post-Botox 

Reduced muscle size, Fat infiltration, Dec in strength


Animals: after botox = smaller muscle size, strength and more fat infiltration. 
Muscle strength also reduced in adjacent and contralateral non target muscles. 

Humans: a single dose of BoNT has been shown to reduce muscle size in humans for up to 1 year and 50% dec in strength. @schroeder2009

---

Humans post Stroke: Botox reduces MAS and elbow flexor strength 3 weeks following botox injection. @chen2020

Human histological studies @howard2021
15 children w/ spastic diplegic CP - botox to gastroc:
Measured calf volume: 5% dec in gastroc volume 5 weeks post injection but 4% inc in soleus volume suggesting adjacent muscle hypertrophy to compensate for injected muscle.
Study 2: Ultrasound to gastroc: demo’d dec’d volume in children with CP post BoNT injection.

---

### Takeaway

Weigh benefits of decreasing spasticity to cons of decreasing strength when making recommendations 

Emphasize  strengthening prior/after botox injections in the muscle injected! 

3-4 week mark = peak effects: Capitalize on motor patterning!

Can be beneficial for decreasing pain!

Monitor for systemic muscle weakness in those getting recurrent botox injections or high doses- potential side effect

## Phenol or Alcohol Blocks () {#phenol-or-alcohol-blocks}

INJ-2: The AAPM&R Spasticity TEP suggests that clinicians consider use of phenol or alcohol blocks for management of focal spasticity.

---

Mild/no sedation. 

Target nerve found via estim/ultrasound. 
Local anesthetic applied, Nerve stimulation performed to find  right motor response. 
Phenol/alcohol then injected, immediately ceasing contractions/spasticity. 
Chemical denatures protein resulting in neuropraxic injury/denervation

---

Can lead to wallerian degeneration of targeted nerve

Can also result in fibrosis/local vascular injury/ muscle necrosis due to non-specific protein denaturation

Average duration of effects last 3-9 months (LONGER than botox)

Applied to isolated motor nerves/motor branches
Not sensory-would result in painful dysesthesias

---


NO large scale clinical studies - only small retrospective, case series/case studies: typically a therapy of last resort and reserved for END STAGE THERAPY 
Stroke, SCI, TBI, CP

Inferior effects compared to botox on spasticity (Gonnade, 2017)

Adverse effects: phenol spreading to adjacent nerves or sensory fibers: 
Painful dysesthesias range between 10-30% depending on study

---

### Takeaways

Phenol/alcohol injected into motor nerves, immediately ceasing contractions/spasticity. 
Chemical denatures protein resulting in neuropraxic injury/denervation
Average duration of effects last 3-9 months (longer than botox)
Usually a tx of last resort-
Inferior effects compared to botox on spasticity (Gonnade, 2017)
Adverse effects: phenol spreading to sensory fibers: 
Painful dysesthesias range between 10-30% depending on study


# Oral Medications (C)

Pharm-1: The AAPM&R Spasticity TEP suggests use of oral medications to manage generalized or systemic spasticity; oral medications can be used either exclusively or as a component of a multimodal treatment approach.

- No medication is uniformly useful in tx of hypertonia
- All drugs can have serious side effects - negative effects will be weighed when prescribed

## Baclofen (C) {#baclofen}

- Muscle relaxant 
- Most common drug for spasticity of spinal region (ie SCI, MS)
- Can be used in supraspinal spasticity (CP, Stroke) 

Some caution w/ use in cerebral forms of spasticity d/t interference with attention/memory on brain injured patients

GABA<sub>B</sub> Agonist - mainly acts at the spinal level 
Inhibits excitation of alpha motor neurons 


---

Peak concentrations: 2-3 hrs after ingestion
Short half life of 2-6 hours - taken in smaller doses throughout day
Adverse effects: weakness, sedation/drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, constipation, confusion, hypotonia, ataxia. 
Sudden withdrawal can cause seizures/hallucinations
@ghanavatian2024

## Baclofen Pump (A){#baclofen-pump}

[**Baclofen Pump**](): Pump implanted under the skin of abdomen, then a catheter is then threaded from the pump to spinal fluid in low back, bypassing BBB.

SUR-1: The AAPM&R Spasticity TEP recommends use of intrathecal baclofen pump therapy (ITB) as an effective treatment of spinal or cerebral origin spasticity in appropriately identified patients.


---


Continuous delivery of baclofen, lower doses compared to oral administration.

Need to trial oral baclofen prior
Checking for side effects

Contraindications: infection, insufficient body mass for pump bulk, 

---

- For SEVERE spasticity, when oral meds fail
- Wait &ge;1 year after brain/SCI before consideration. 
- Global OR regional spasticity for CP, brain injury, stroke, SCI, MS. 
- Negative effects on arousal/cognition
- Most meds will last 2-3 months before requiring refill
- Battery lasts 4-7 yrs -need another surgery to replace

## Tizanidine {#tizanidine}

- &alpha;-2 adrenergic agonist
- Causes decrease in presynaptic activity of excitatory interneurons in spinal cord
- Decreases stretch reflex activity/motor neuron excitability


Used in Cerebral + Spinal disorders: MS, Stroke, ALS

---

Sedation, dizziness, dry mouth common after &rarr; weakness is not a big problem
Lasts 3-6 hours, max effects at 1-2 hours after administration
Shown to have a more favorable tolerability profile, less reported mm weakness + less sedation compared to baclofen 

## Dantrolene

- Acts outside the CNS &rarr; muscle fiber level
Inhibits release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from Endoplasmic Reticulum in muscle cells
- Ca<sup>2+</sup> normally binds onto troponin in actin filaments allowing actin-myosin cross bridging (so inhibiting this decreases contractility of muscles) 
- Peak Effects: 1-3.5 hrs after ingestion
- Long lasting: 8-10 hours

---

Side effects: weakness ( ie respiratory muscle weakness), sedation, GI sx, dizziness, fatigue
Big warning for Serious hepatotoxicity 
Will need to liver eval prior and monitoring after
Used for stroke, SCI, CP, MS, etc
NOT in ALS- can progress mm weakness
Less sedative than baclofen - more preserved cognitive function 

## Diazepam {#diazepam}

[**Diazepam**]: 

- GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist, acts on Brain + SC  (Stroke, CP, TBI)
- Commonly short term only
- Onset of action: 15-60 min
- Duration of onset:  12+ hrs, very long lasting

---

Side effects: 

- Sedation
- Impaired memory/cognition
- Ataxia
- Fatigue
- Confusion
- Depression
- Respiratory depression
- Bradycardia
- Suicidality
- Syncope
- Hypotension 

---

### Diazepam Takeaway

- Schedule IV controlled substance w/ potential for abuse
- Abrupt cessation: seizures, hallucinations 
- Elderly pts have dec’d renal fxn - not recommended d/t issues w diazepam accumulation/renal issues

## Gabapentin {#gabapentin}

- Inhibits glutamate, creating inhibitory effect for motor neurons
- Usually MS/SCI populations 
- Used when other first line drug tx do not work 
- Few sedative effects
- Helpful to dec neuropathic pain as well


## Cannabinoids/THC {#cannabinoids}

Enhances GABA, reduces effects of Glu
New area of research, mostly studied in MS
Reduces excitatory neurotransmission &rarr; decreasing spasticity 
Can help tx pain associated w/ spasticity too
Moderately effective in reducing spasticity scores, but almost as effective as other drug tx: baclofen, tizanidine (Jones et al, 2020)

## Oral Meds Takeaways

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Yes: Pain, Interference with ADLs/PT
:::
::: {.column}
No: 
Not for FOCAL spasticity d/t global effects of drugs
If spasticity helps w/ walking/functional tasks don’t  recommend 
Weigh other pros of spasticity: DVT prevention, dec risk of osteoporosis, protective marker if something is awry in body
:::
:::

Big risk for adverse effects on cognition/sedation - be sure to educate patients about this when suggesting drugs

::: {.callout-note}
In many stroke pts, spasticity is local (1-2 muscle groups) which is easily targeted with Botox or peripheral nerve blocks NOT drugs (Bakheit, 2012). MS/CP/TBI may be more systemic
:::

# Non-pharma treatments (NG)

consideration of use of nonpharmacologic interventions from a range of treatment modalities, in conjunction with other therapeutic options to effect spasticity and facilitate the effects of pharmacologic and procedural interventions on spasticity and to improve function and decrease deleterious effects of contributing conditions.

::: {.callout-note}
Can not be graded due to limitations in evidence
:::

## NMES

SR+ Meta-Analysis @stein2015

- Decreases spasticity + increase ROM when compared to controls
- Most often [Tib Ant]({{< var ref-tibialis-anterior.path >}}) or [Gastroc]({{< var ref-gastrocnemius.path >}}) + combined w gait training 
- Both show improvements in tone/stiffness, however over Tib Ant= better improvements in gait/spasticity (Yang, 2018)

Reciprocal inhibition:
Short term - when in use up to 15 min after @milosevic2019


### NMES Actions

@motta-oishi2013

- Agonist Estim-Recurrent inhibition or just muscle fatigue
- Antagonist Estim-Reciprocal inhibition
- Other mechanisms

::: {.callout-note}
NMES has the potential to induce neuroplasticity within spinal cord paths @bergquist2011
Suppresses exaggerated excitability 

:::


## Resistance Training

Spasticity can LEAD to weakness
Type II &rarr; Type I fibers (Fan et al, 2020)
Due to 
Reduced voluntary motor unit recruitment
Relative immobilization/Chronic disuse 
Causes plastic rearrangements in higher centers that further reduces ability to voluntarily recruit motor units &rarr; aggravating spasticity (Gracies et al, 2005)
Strength training is inconclusive in decreasing spasticity but important to train to minimize atrophy/improve motor control (Brashear et al, 2016)

### Antagonist Strengthening

How? Reciprocal Inhibition: when one muscle contracts, the other stretches/relaxes 
Theory - no direct evidence for this in strength training 

---

How? Reciprocal Inhibition: when one muscle contracts, the other stretches/relaxes 
Strengthening the antagonist &rarr; inhibitory interneurons in SC &rarr; inhibits alpha motor neurons connecting to spastic muscle, allowing stretch
Dec’d inhibition compared to controls, but inhibition path still occurs with spastic individuals (Morita, 2006)
Antagonist contraction can influence cortical plasticity of agonist (Fang, 2014)

::: {.callout-note}
Theory -I could not find any evidence for this in strength training, EMG studies show strength training does not influence this @smania2010
:::

## Weight Bearing

@Megia-Garcia2021

WB provides proprioceptive input
Activates joint mechanoreceptors, cutaneous receptors (detecting pressure/stretch vibration)
Activates spinal interneurons &rarr; dec motor neuron excitability to soleus allowing higher reflex thresholds to allow for walking @nakazawa2004 

::: {.callout-note}
Why the patellar reflex is not as intense in standing! 
:::

---

Increases afferent input &rarr; reduces hyperactive stretch reflex
Studies focus on BWTT, kneeling walking, etc show a decrease in MAS scores/Spasticity/Reflex @peurala2005

---


- BWTT reduces the amplitude of soleus max H/M ratio  in those with SCI, which is a reflection of reduced motor neuron excitability (less tone/spasticity) [@trimble2001]
- H/M ratio is commonly used to eval balance between excitatory/inhibitory inputs to motor neurons [@trimble2001]
- Spastic Pts: typically inc’d H/M ratio (more motor neuron excitabilty) [@trimble2001]

---



BWTT vs tilt table [@adams2011]

BWTT: decreased tone, flexor spasms and motor neuron excitability [@adams2011]

---

### WB Regressions

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Half kneeling**

Can improve dissociation 
Oppo mvmts and positioning of 2 limbs (one in flexion with other in extension)
Quadruped, tall kneeling, modified plantigrade (standing w hands on table), standing [@fellLifespanNeurorehabilitationPatientcentered2019]
:::
::: {.column}
**Quadruped**

Particularly in those with extensor spasticity 
Can help induce flexion of hip/knees, providing prolonged stretch to muscle groups
Incorporates reciprocal agonist - antagonist muscle recruitment and motor control
Can help reduce spasticity through consistent reciprocal inhibition of hypertonic muscles [@fellLifespanNeurorehabilitationPatientcentered2019]
:::
:::



## Whole Body Vibration

[**Whole Body Vibration**]({{< var ref-whole-body-vibration.path >}}): {{< var ref-whole-body-vibration.definition >}}

---

### Theory

- Proposed to activate Ia and II afferent fibers, increasing sensory input to CNS &rarr; Presynaptic inhibition 

---

### Studies

- Mechanism of WBVT has not been fully proven
- REDUCES reflex activity by modulating spinal excitability, enhancing voluntary muscle activation [@krause2017] 
- Spasticity = muscle overreacts to small stretch loads, so by reducing reflex activity, patient can access voluntary muscle activation (supraspinally) better [@krause2017]

---

### Vibration Also Increases Excitation of Brain
 

Increases excitability of brain areas involved in movement (primary motor/pre-motor shown in fNIRS, EEG studies ) 
Promotes neuroplasticity of brain areas that are affected in those w/ spasticity [@miyara2020; @lopez2017]

---

### Benefits

- &darr; spasticity  (Krause, 2017)[@krause2017]
- &uarr; Strength (in stroke, CP and in elderly healthy adults: MVIC, CSA) [@machado2010; @pulay2023; @tihanyi2007]
- &uarr; blood circulation [@dionello2017]
- &uarr; ROM of knee joint [@krause2017]
- Better functional outcomes: TUG, 10 MWT [@dionello2017]
- Benefits proprioception (shown in a post ACL-R population [@moezy2008] via a joint repositioning test)

---

### Vibration Parameters

@zhang2023

WBVT for 10 min at <20Hz frequency improves spasticity in UE + LE 

::: {.callout-tip}
Lasts about 10 min! Capitalize!
:::



## Casting

- Maximal stretch &rarr; muscle fatigues then elongates
- Cast is changed every 2 weeks to new lengthened position
- After Botox, casting can help facilitate further spasticity reduction @winstein2017 @farag2020

## Serial Casting

[**Serial Casting**](): {{< var ref-serial-casting.definition >}}

---

::: {.columns}

- Affects ADLs/Gait

## AFOs

- Prevents contracture [@weinstein2017]
- Increases DF ROM 
- Improved gait mechanics, speed
- Improved spasticity via stretch reflex and MAS [@chen2022]



## Night Splints

[**Night Splints**]({{< var ref-night-splint.path >}}):

---


### Wrists night splint

- “Strong evidence wearing a splint all night has no effect in reducing spasticity/contracture” @lannin2011
- AHA states it may prevent contractures but data is conflicting @winstein2016

---

### Ankle night splints


Wearing a foot splint 12+ hours a day did not affect joint mobility in adults post TBI  (Sung et al, 2016)

Combo + botox &rarr; best effects on spasticity
Alone - very mixed/little evidence (Synnot et al, 2017)


::: {.callout}
Note: more evidence in CP/Pediatric populations although still inconclusive 
:::

## Aerobic Training

[**Aerobic Training**]():

---

HIIT increases: BDNF, dopamine, neuroplasticity/retention/learning, attenuates neurodegeneration, helps mood, etc also….

- Changes cortical inhibition @abraha2018
- Decreases motor neuron excitability @bulbulian1986
- H/M ratio after low vs high intensity exercises in a healthy population

---

Treadmill for 20 min:

- 12.8% reduction in H/M ratio (w/ 40% Vo2)
- 21.5% reduction in H/M ratio  (w/ 75% Vo2) 
- Decreases Spasticity Acutely in ppl w/ stroke (Sakamoto et al 2014)
- Picture: exercise: 1 arm cycling at 50% max workload for 10 min, control is rest. Measured spasticity in OPPOSITE arm. 
- Decreases spasticity in rat model of SCI - through BDNF modulating excitability in spine [@beverungen2020]

## Stretching

[**Stretching**]():

---

- Not enough evidence for long term spasticity management 
- Passive stretches may have SHORT term decreases in spasticity, NOT long term [@BovendEerdt2008]
- Any effect on motor neuron excitability?
- Mixed results [@BovendEerdt2008]

---

SR Figure:  Non-statistically significant results in favor of the stretching group were observed for MAS, but ROM/functional tasks (ie gait) showed no difference @gomez2021

Could help prevent contractures/dec pain, although no conclusive evidence 

## Stretch-Contract

[**Stretch-contract**]();

---

### Limitations

- Only studies in healthy adults [@fukara2022; @fellLifespanNeurorehabilitationPatientcentered2019]
- Likely short term effects (ROM)
- Lengthening a spastic muscle followed by contraciton of antagonist (Induces Reciprocal Inhibition)
- Lengthen spastic mm + contraction of spastic mm (induces Recurrent Inhibition) 


## Cryotherapy

- Decreases nerve conduction velocity, dec H/M ratio [@abdelhakiem2024]
- Multiple studies show dec in spasticity post icing [@abdelhakiem2024; @garcia2019; @alcantara2019]
- 20 minutes of icing &rarr; decreased PF spasticity for up to 30 min post icing
- Did not affect proprioception [@garcia2019]
- No effects on muscle torque capacity [@alcantara2019]

## Thermotherapy

- Can dampen muscle excitability
- Dosage: 10min, 106&deg;F warm foot bath 
- Effects: Decreased muscle tone for &le;30min [@matsumoto2006; @matsumoto2010; @matsumoto2014].

Aquatic therapy in warm water can also decrease spasticity [@kesikatas2004]

## Kinesiotape {.smaller}

---

Inhibitory kinesiotaping [@mehraein2021]
Application of inhibitory KT was found to be able to reduce the Hmax/Mmax ratio in patients with stroke. 
No sig change in MAS

Limited number of studies, hypothesized d/t recurrent inhibition of hypertonic mm or proprioceptive effects 

## Deep Pressure to Tendon

Deep pressure to tendon
Compressive pressure over longitudinal axis of tendon of a hypertonic muscle to activate GTOs
GTOs could help induce elongation to muscle as it feels itself being stretched, thus reducing tone. @cite

## Joint Traction
Joint Traction
May increase joint awareness w/ inc’d activation of joint receptors @cite

## Biofeedback

- Repetitive Transcranial magnetic stimulation
- And so much more!

# Conclusion

- Experiment
- Reassess



## Reassess

My recommendation for treatment of Spasticity/Hypertonia: Test, retest!

With [Tardieu]({{< var ref-modified-tardieu-scale.path >}}) (Spasticity) or [MAS]({{< var ref-modified-ashworth-scale.path >}}) (Tone)

Tardieu tests at different velocities - spasticity is velocity dependent so if you use MAS, you may not pick up on spasticity 


# Summary

Most Common Types of Hypertonia: Rigidity/Spasticity 

- Stroke/SCI etc &rarr; Spasticity &rarr;d/t loss of inhibition from CST/RST/ overexcitation of motor neurons
- PD &rarr; Rigidity &rarr; BG degeneration
- Many PT treatment options for reductions in spasticity/rigidity &rarr; important to test- retest with MAS/Tardieu scales!
