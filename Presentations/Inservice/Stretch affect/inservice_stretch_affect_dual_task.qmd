# Intro

- Difference in non-contact injury rates in practice vs games/scrimmage
- What problem are we trying to solve?
    - Reduce NC injuries?
    - Improve gametime performance?


:::

*Progressive overload* is a basic concept in training.
Generally we increase our training load by increase the amount of weight in order to get stronger, number of repetitions in order to build endurance, the speed of the exercise to build speed and power, or the complexity of the exercise to build stability.
These are all important in athletic performance, but focusing your training *solely* around these purely phyiscal parameters may leave your unprepared for the mental load of game-time situations.

During training, you can focus almost all of your attention on the task and maintaining proper form, but during a game or daily life, you will be experiencing distractions that will pull your attention away from your form.

This is where cognitive-motor dual task (CMDT) interference training is important.


# What is Dual-task training?

::: {.callout}

- @evansDualProcessTheoriesHigher2013

:::

Dual-task training is based on **Dual-process theory** @evansDualProcessTheoriesHigher2013.
Dual-process theory proports that when performing multiple tasks, the human peformance is determined by two types of processing systems: [Automatic processing]({{< var ref-dual-process-theory.automatic-processing >}}) and [controlled processing]({{< var ref-dual-process-theory.controlled-processing >}}) [@moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021; @evansDualProcessTheoriesHigher2013].


A **dual-task** refers to an activity that requires both *automatic* and *controlled* processing @moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021.
“Automatic processing (type 1) is fast and autonomous, activated by triggers; for example, when one is questioned “What is your name?”, he/she will provide an automatic fast answer. Controlled processing (type 2) is slow and activates the working memory (WM), requiring information storage and processing, and attentional control (the latter is required in both automatic and controlled systems) [4]. For example, in a soccer match, after receiving the ball, the player realizes that a teammate is in a good position and, hence, decides to pass the ball to him, which is done with low attentional resources allocated in the motor execution (type 1 processing). Simultaneously, attentional resources are allocated to identify and interpret the opponents’ positioning on the pitch (type 2 processing). These multiple tasks executed simultaneously are known in the scientific literature as dual-tasks.” @moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021 

## Definitions

- **Primary task**: The task or exercise you want to get better at and want to transfer to performance in game or in daily life
- **Secondary task**: The other tasks that pulls attention away from the primary task
- Working memory capacity
    - Low Working memory capacity
    - High Working memory capacity

:::

- “In open sports, the execution of dual-tasks occurs in a highly time-constrained environment, which might also lead to a choking condition that impairs performance”  @moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021 
Pathophys of “choking”
- “The attentional focus may also explain the drop in motor performance in dual-tasks. Previous research has shown that the difficulty of the dual-tasks led individuals to the state of “choking” [19], with increased levels of anxiety and the explicit direction of the attentional focus to the execution of the movement (autofocus).” @moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021

“Concerning the chronic effects, training with dual-tasks improved both motor and cognitive performance. Bherer et al. [51] suggested that dual-tasks training leads to the development of new perceptual strategies (optimizing attentional focus for the relevant clues in the task) that contribute to improved decision-making [52], as supported by some findings of the present review [21,26]. The significant increase in the duration of the quiet eye [45] after training with dual-tasks indicate that the athletes directed their attention to specific spots for a longer time to extract relevant information for the tactical decision. Additionally, the improvement in the efficiency of attentional control after training can be supported by other enhanced cognitive processes such as the ability to sustain attention and processing speed, observed in the study of Fleddermann et al. [21].” @moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021

# Treatment effect

Acute effect (“dual task cost paradigm”)
There should be a reduction in performance of the task during a dual-task compared to the single-task  @moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021 
This is theorized as the “dual-task cost paradigm” which proposes that cognitive tasks often require most of the attentional resources which results reducing cognitive and motor performance  @moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021 
Chronic effect
Chronical dual tasking results in increases in motor and cognitive performance  @moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021 

# Literature Limitation

“However, the relationship between dual-tasks performance, visual search behavior, and attentional control remains unclear; future studies are recommended to elucidate how and to where athletes direct their attentional focus (e.g., gaze behavior) in situations with cognitive interference (dual-tasks). This information will allow coaches to direct athletes’ attention to the most relevant cues during tactical training.” @moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021
“Despite the innovative information on the acute and chronic effects of dual-tasks in sports, the present study has some limitations. Although most of the studies presented high methodological quality, some intervening variables were not controlled. For example, there seemed to be differences in the cost of dual-tasks between athletes of different levels (experts, non-experts, and novices), different sexes, and from the team or individual sports. Calculating these differences was not possible due to the heterogeneity of participants” @moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021

# How to Assess Low or High working capacity?

How to use blazepods to test this?
What is the required equipment
How to interpret the data
Does anything demonstrate increased or decreased risk?
What is the responsiveness?
Are there other clinical tests?
Dual-Task Cost Equation =  (DT − ST)/ST × 100
How long does it take to see results?

# Treatment
## Treatment concepts
Eyes are on surroundings and environment
Change the environment so the focus is away from the movement
Cognitive endurance
Do not let the cognitive system rest, keep loading it through multiple exercises even if you target different regions
Other considerations
Fatigue from a game (do most injuries occur early or later in games?)

## Treatment Ideas
VR soccer kick? -from CSM talk, is this relevant or just for ACLR
Bounce or throw a ball to them
Types of secondary tasks
auditory, visual, memorizing, mathematical operations, and balance @moreiraAcuteChronicEffects2021 

## Modalities
Synaptec?
Blazepods?

## Resources for exercise ideas

- Kevin Wilk IG

## Is dual-task training only for athletes?

- This can apply to patients with back instability that get distracted and forget to brace when performing movements
